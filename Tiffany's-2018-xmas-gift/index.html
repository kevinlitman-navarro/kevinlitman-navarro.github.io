          Men on Reddit are weird and sad. This is the first law of Redditdynamics, and, unfortunately it seems, the first law of being a young man in the United States at this moment. The second law of Redditdynamics is that as time passes, weird, sad men (WADs) will express their weird sadness in increasingly weird and sad ways. This is why Jordan Peterson eats a meat-only diet, and yes, it is a corollary for the second law of thermodynamics because the universe is a beautiful place.

          Recently, some WADs on r/dataisbeautiful, a subreddit where people post data visualizations, have been coping with romantic breakups in a strange and public way (remember the second law of Redditdynamics). Using charts, they perform a postmortem on their late relationships. Is there a pattern in the volume of texts sent between WADs and their partners that, if noticed earlier, could have portended the breakup? Was the writing on the wall?

          Oh, did I not mention the WADs fucking suck at design??? I mean look at that shit. How are you going to spend all this time delving into your sordid romantic past and use that goddamn color scheme??? Green and peach, what a psychopath. Is this person's attached to their neck sideways? Flip the fucking text, and pick a different font jesus fuck.

          But I digress. A long time ago, you asked me to share our text message history with you. At the time, I possessed neither the requisite computer skills nor the werewithal to do so.  Today, I have a fifteen thousand dollar certificate in making my computer do things and the energy of a stallion in heat. Taking inspiration from the WADs, and in spite of Apple's byzantine file structure, I managed to extract our entire texting record, and like a good lover who definitely isn't autistic, express my affection with some charts.

          I wanted to give you a year-by-year look at the content of our messages, so I did what any sane person would do â€” I made a series of wordclouds shaped like dogs. First up, we have 2015, a year in which we sent 3,516 texts. You'll notice the word &ldquo;jack&rdquo; makes an appearance, as does &ldquo;tara&rdquo;. Drama!

          2016 was our biggest texting year, as we spent six months doing long distance and sending a grand total of 30,156 texts. The word &ldquo;love&rdquo; really got bandied about quite a lot then, and we seemed to be doing alot of thinking.

          In 2017, our texting output regressed dramatically, with us logging 17,593 of those bad boys. We did less long distance that year, and saw each other more freouently, and moved in together! I think this explaines my &ldquo;home&rdquo; is so prevalent. This is also the first year &ldquo;Oscar&rdquo; cracked the wordcloud.

          <p class="body-text sub-font">
          We took a far more judicious approach to texting in 2018, sending a mere 6,140 messages (up to date as of December 24). Oscar had a real takeover in the textsphere this year, and &ldquo;shit&rdquo; got a little bigger, who could say why? &ldquo;Dinner&rdquo; made the cut, which makes sense, and work looms large.

          This has been fun! But wordclouds are frivolous and frowned upon; we need a good, solid chart to really figure out what this whole relationship thing is all about. Thankfully, I'm no WAD. Without further ado, please enjoy this well-designed masterpiece, a look at our texting history over the years, with highlights.
