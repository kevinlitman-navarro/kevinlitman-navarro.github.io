                Your data is everywhere. If you use the internet, you're constantly interacting with massive platforms that collect information about you, from personal identifiers like name, age, and email address to behavioral cues like what you click on, time spent on certain websites, even how you scroll down a page. If you have a smart phone, your location is probably under constant surveillance, if not by your mobile provider, then by Google, or some free game you downloaded and forgot about months ago. 
                <br><br>
                The data collection market is already so lucrative and intertwined with our everyday lives that it's hard to imagine a time before data was currency. It's like we were handed Pandora's box, and a few tech companies reached over and opened it for us.
                <br><br>
                You may not be aware of the extent to which your data is being harvested. Still, these ethically dubious techniques are generally legal as long as a company discloses its data collection practices in its terms of service and privacy policy. By using a service, you sign a contract (either explicit or implicit), agreeing to grant access to your data as described in the disclosures. But the distance between what a platform discloses and what a user understands can be vast: privacy policies are lengthy documents written in legalese with a heavy dose of technical jargon.

      <p class="body-text sub-font">
      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the nascent EU data privacy protection framework, aims to close the gap between disclosure and comprehension. When the GDPR was first implemented last year, every company that stores data from users in EU countries was forced to overhaul the language in its privacy policy to meet a new standard for readability. Now, any data collecting platform or service must disclose what data they collect and how that data is used in a "concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language."
