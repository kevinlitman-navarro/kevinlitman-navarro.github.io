Abduction,0.7621743679046631,0.8044182062149048,"

In the philosophical literature, the term “abduction” is
used in two related but different senses. In both senses, the term
refers to some form of explanatory reasoning. However, in the
historically first sense, it refers to the place of explanatory
reasoning in generating hypotheses, while in the sense in
which it is used most frequently in the modern literature it refers to
the place of explanatory reasoning in justifying hypotheses.
In the latter sense, abduction is also often called “Inference
to the Best Explanation.”

This entry is exclusively concerned with abduction in the modern
sense, although there is a supplement on abduction in the historical
sense, which had its origin in the work of Charles Sanders
Peirce—see the

Supplement: Peirce on Abduction.

 scientific discovery,
 in particular the section on discovery as abduction.

Most philosophers agree that abduction (in the sense of Inference to
the Best Explanation) is a type of inference that is frequently
employed, in some form or other, both in everyday and in scientific
reasoning. However, the exact form as well as the normative status of
abduction are still matters of controversy. This entry contrasts
abduction with other types of inference; points at prominent uses of
it, both in and outside philosophy; considers various more or less
precise statements of it; discusses its normative status; and
highlights possible connections between abduction and Bayesian
confirmation theory.

Peter Abelard,0.6542271971702576,0.2037860006093979,"

Peter Abelard (1079–21 April 1142) [‘Abailard’ or
‘Abaelard’ or ‘Habalaarz’ and so on] was the
pre-eminent philosopher and theologian of the twelfth century. The
teacher of his generation, he was also famous as a poet and a
musician. Prior to the recovery of Aristotle, he brought the native
Latin tradition in philosophy to its highest pitch. His genius was
evident in all he did. He is, arguably, the greatest logician of the
Middle Ages and is equally famous as the first great nominalist
philosopher. He championed the use of reason in matters of faith (he
was the first to use ‘theology’ in its modern sense), and
his systematic treatment of religious doctrines are as remarkable for
their philosophical penetration and subtlety as they are for their
audacity. Abelard seemed larger than life to his contemporaries: his
quick wit, sharp tongue, perfect memory, and boundless arrogance made
him unbeatable in debate—he was said by supporter and detractor
alike never to have lost an argument—and the force of his
personality impressed itself vividly on all with whom he came into
contact. His luckless affair with Héloïse made him a
tragic figure of romance, and his conflict with Bernard of Clairvaux
over reason and religion made him the hero of the Enlightenment. For
all his colourful life, though, his philosophical achievements are the
cornerstone of his fame.

Abhidharma,0.7309630513191223,0.3510562777519226,"


The first centuries after Śākyamuni Buddha’s death
saw the rise of multiple schools of thought and teacher lineages within
the Buddhist community as it spread throughout the Indian subcontinent.
These new forms of scholarly monastic communities had distinct
theoretical and practical interests and, in their efforts to organize,
interpret, and reexamine the Buddha’s scattered teachings, they
developed a particular system of thought and method of exposition
called Abhidharma (Pali, Abhidhamma). The Sanskrit term
abhidharma seems to derive from the expression
“concerning (abhi) the teaching(s) (Skt.,
dharma, Pali, dhamma).” For the Buddhist
exegetical tradition, however, the term means approximately
“higher” or “further” teaching, and it refers
both to the doctrinal investigations of the new scholastic movement and
to the body of texts yielded by its systematic exposition of Buddhist
thought. This body of literature includes the third of the “three
baskets” (Skt., tripiṭaka, Pali,
tipiṭaka) of the Buddhist canon, namely, the
Abhidharma-piṭaka (Pali,
Abhidhamma-piṭaka), its commentaries, and later
exegetical texts.


Both as an independent literary genre and a branch of thought and
inquiry, Abhidharma is to be contrasted with Sūtrānta, the
system of the Buddha’s discourses (Skt., sūtras,
Pali, suttas). Unlike the earlier Buddhist discourses that are
colloquial in nature, the Abhidharma method presents the Buddha’s
teachings in technical terms that are carefully defined to ensure
analytical exactitude. In content, Abhidharma is distinctive in its
efforts to provide the theoretical counterpart to the Buddhist practice
of meditation and, more broadly, a systematic account of sentient
experience. It does so by analyzing conscious experience—and in
this sense one’s “world”—into its constituent
mental and physical events (Skt., dharmā, Pali,
dhammā, hereafter dharmas/dhammas respectively).
The overarching inquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas
into multiple categories and their synthesis into a unified structure
by means of their manifold relationships of causal conditioning is
referred to as the “dharma theory.” The exhaustive
investigations into the nature and interaction of dharmas
extended into the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, and ontology,
and generated doctrinal controversies among different Buddhist schools.
The Abhidharma analysis of and methods of argumentation about these
controversies provided the framework of reference and defined the
agenda for the Mahāyāna schools of Madhyamaka and
Yogācāra. As a distinct doctrinal movement, then, Abhidharma
had a remarkable impact on subsequent Buddhist thought and gave rise to
Buddhist systematic philosophy and hermeneutics.

Abilities,0.5875151753425598,0.7765862941741943,"


In the accounts we give of one another, claims about our
abilities appear to be indispensable.  Some abilities are so
widespread that many who have them take them for granted, such as the
ability to walk, or to write one's name, or to tell a hawk from a
handsaw.  Others are comparatively rare and notable, such as the
ability to hit a Major League fastball, or to compose a symphony, or
to tell an elm from a beech. In either case, however, when we ascribe
such abilities to one another we have the impression that we are
making claims that, whether they are worth saying or not, are at least
sometimes true. The impression of truth exerts a pressure towards
giving a philosophical theory of ability. It is not an option, at
least at the outset, to dismiss all our talk of ability as fiction or
outright falsehood. A theory of ability can be reasonably expected to
say what it is to have an ability in a way that vindicates the
appearance of truth. Such a theory will deserve the name
‘philosophical’ insofar as it gives an account, not of
this or that range of abilities, but of abilities generally.


This article falls into three parts. The first part, Sections 1 and 2,
states a framework for discussing philosophical theories of
ability. Section 1 will say more about the distinction between
abilities and other modal aspects of people and things. Section 2 will
articulate constraints on a satisfactory theory. The second part,
Sections 3 and 4, surveys theories of ability that have been defended
in the philosophical literature. Section 3 concerns the most prominent
kind of theory, on which abilities are to be understood in terms of a
hypothetical relating an agent's actions to her volitions. Section 4
considers views of ability that are not hypothetical in this way. The
third part, Section 5, turns to the relationship between a theory of
ability and the free will debates. Such debates often involve claims
about agents' abilities, and many have hoped that getting clearer on
abilities themselves could resolve, or at least shed light on, such
debates. The aim of this last section will be to assess whether these
hopes are reasonable ones.

Abner of Burgos,0.5344177484512329,0.12947823107242584,"

Abner of Burgos (Alfonso de Valladolid; c. 1260–1347) was
perhaps the most important philosopher in the stream of Jewish Spanish
rabbi-apostates in the 14th and 15th centuries.
In the first part of his life, Abner was an Aristotelian Jewish
philosopher. However, at the age of 60 (if Pablo de Santa Maria is a
reliable source) after years of hesitation, he became a Neo-Platonic
Christian, making him one of the very few philosophers (much less
philosopher-rabbis) to change his philosophical opinion (and religion)
during the Middle Ages. The majorities of his works are primarily
polemical, and try to convince his former fellow Jews to become
Christian, as he did. However, in his polemical writings, Abner built
an original philosophical critique of both traditional Judaism and the
Aristotelian (and Maimonidean) philosophical interpretation of
Judaism. Another part of his philosophical aim was a very radical
interpretation of Christianity aimed at convincing his Jewish audience
that his Christianity was superior to traditional and philosophical
Judaism. Abner was one of the first philosophical and scientific
critics of Aristotle, as well as one of the more radical Neo-Platonic
thinkers of Christianity during the Middle Ages. His works had a very
important impact on Jewish philosophy at the latter end of the Middle
Ages, and some of his opinions influenced, through Rabbi Hasdai
Crescas, general Western philosophy.

Judah Abrabanel,0.5681220889091492,0.4333794713020325,"


Judah Abrabanel (ca. 1465–after 1521), also known as Leone Ebreo, is
an important transitional figure in the history of Jewish
philosophy. Common to any transitional figure, however, is the problem
of contextualization. In the case of Judah Abrabanel, do we regard him
as the last of the medieval Jewish philosophers or the first of the
early modern ones?  His work, for example, is certainly in
conversation with a number of themes found in Renaissance Platonism
and Humanism. Yet at the same time he freely draws upon the cosmology
and metaphysics of his Jewish and Islamic predecessors.


Abrabanel’s magnum opus, the Dialoghi d’amore
(“Dialogues of Love”) belongs to the genre of the
trattato d’amore (“treatise on love”) that was
intimately connected to both the Renaissance and the development of
the Italian vernacular. Although Abrabanel’s dialogue provides one of
the genre’s most important philosophical discussions in this, it
nonetheless is confined to its literary and stylized form. The work
itself consists of three dialogues, with the third one providing the
longest and most sustained philosophical discussion. Some contend that
Abrabanel originally composed an introduction to the work and a fourth
dialogue, neither of which
 survives.[1] 
 In essence, the Dialoghi offers the transcript of a
conversation between two individuals, Philo and Sophia, two courtiers,
who discourse on the nature of love as both a sensual and cosmic
principle.  Philo, the male character, is portrayed as an
accomplished philosopher, and Sophia, the female character, as a
student of philosophy.  Despite this, Sophia is not just a
convenient textual strategy, but becomes a character in her own right,
someone who significantly contributes to the philosophical unfolding
of the work. Moreover, many of the dialogic exchanges that take place
between Philo and Sophia are very playful, with Philo, on one level,
either answering Sophia’s questions about love or responding to
her criticisms; yet, on another level, he physically desires Sophia
and wishes to consummate this desire. Philo’s desire for Sophia,
thus, reflects the same desire of God (the superior) for the world
(the inferior). As a Renaissance artist, then, Abrabanel cleverly and
artfully weaves the philosophical principles of love, beauty, and
desire into the very literary structure of his Dialoghi.

Abstract Objects,0.7815978527069092,0.5599793791770935,"

It is widely supposed that every entity falls into one of two
categories: Some are concrete; the rest abstract. The distinction is
supposed to be of fundamental significance for metaphysics and
epistemology. This article surveys a number of recent attempts to say
how it should be drawn.

Essential vs. Accidental Properties,0.7973182797431946,0.5471182465553284,"

The distinction between essential versus accidental
properties has been characterized in various ways, but it is
currently most commonly understood in modal terms: an essential
property of an object is a property that it must have, while an
accidental property of an object is one that it happens to
have but that it could lack. Let’s call this the basic modal
characterization, where a modal characterization of a
notion is one that explains the notion in terms of
necessity/possibility. In the characterization just given of the
distinction between essential and accidental properties, the use of
the word “must” reflects the fact that
necessity is invoked, while the use of the word
“could” reflects that possibility is
invoked. The notions of necessity and possibility are interdefinable:
to say that something is necessary is to say that its negation is not
possible; to say that something is possible is to say that its
negation is not necessary; to say that an object must have a certain
property is to say that it could not lack it; and to say that an
object could have a certain property is to say that it is not the case
that it must lack it.

Many would say that each individual human could not fail to be human;
if so, then the basic modal characterization counts the property of
being human as an essential property of each human. And, too, many
would say that although someone, say Socrates, is in fact fond of
dogs, Socrates could have lacked that property; if that is right, then
the basic modal characterization counts the property of being fond of
dogs as an accidental property of Socrates.

A modal characterization of the distinction between essential and
accidental properties is taken for granted in nearly all work in
analytic metaphysics since the 1950s. Advocates of the modal
characterization have included Ruth Barcan Marcus (1967) and Saul
Kripke (1972/1980), among others. However, some other
characterizations of the distinction (see §2) have recently
gained currency. It is worth stressing here at the outset that
although there is now some disagreement about how the distinction
between essential and accidental properties is to be drawn, there is
nevertheless some agreement about cases. Most would agree that however
the distinction is drawn, it should come out that being human (or
being human if existent) is an essential property of Socrates while
being fond of dogs is a merely accidental property of Socrates.

Essentialism in general may be characterized as the doctrine
that (at least some) objects have (at least some) essential
properties. This characterization is not universally accepted (see
§3), but no characterization is; and at least this one has the
virtue of being simple and straightforward. As for specific
essentialist claims, we have already encountered one—the claim
that the property of being human is essential to Socrates. Another
example is the claim that Socrates’s biological
origin—Socrates’s parents, or more particularly, the sperm
and egg from which Socrates arose—is essential to Socrates. The
first example is a brand of sortal essentialism while the
second is a brand of origin essentialism. Both of these kinds
of essentialisms have figured prominently in the philosophical
literature.

Action,0.5691413283348083,0.8095797300338745,"


If a person's head moves, she may or may not have moved her head,
and, if she did move it, she may have actively performed the movement
of her head or merely, by doing something else, caused a passive
movement. And, if she performed the movement, she might have done so
intentionally or not. This short array of contrasts (and others like
them) has motivated questions about the nature, variety, and identity
of action. Beyond the matter of her moving, when the person moves her
head, she may be indicating agreement or shaking an insect off her ear.
Should we think of the consequences, conventional or causal, of
physical behavior as constituents of an action distinct from but
‘generated by’ the movement? Or should we think that there
is a single action describable in a host of ways? Also, actions, in
even the most minimal sense, seem to be essentially
‘active’. But how can we explain what this property
amounts to and defend our wavering intuitions about which events fall
in the category of the ‘active’ and which do not?


Donald Davidson [1980, essay 3] asserted that an action, in some
basic sense, is something an agent does that was ‘intentional
under some description,’ and many other philosophers have agreed
with him that there is a conceptual tie between genuine action, on the
one hand, and intention, on the other. However, it is tricky to
explicate the purported tie between the two concepts. First, the
concept of ‘intention’ has various conceptual inflections
whose connections to one another are not at all easy to delineate, and
there have been many attempts to map the relations between intentions
for the future, acting intentionally, and acting with a certain
intention. Second, the notion that human behavior is often intentional
under one description but not under another is itself hard to pin down.
For example, as Davidson pointed out, an agent may intentionally cause
himself to trip, and the activity that caused the tripping may have
been intentional under that description while, presumably, the foreseen
but involuntary tripping behavior that it caused is not supposed to be
intentional under any heading. Nevertheless, both the tripping and its
active cause are required to make it true that the agent intentionally
caused himself to trip. Both occurrences fall equally, in that sense,
‘under’ the operative description. So further clarification
is called for.


There has been a notable or notorious debate about whether the agent's
reasons in acting are causes of the action — a longstanding
debate about the character of our common sense explanations of
actions.  Some philosophers have maintained that we explain why an
agent acted as he did when we explicate how the agent's normative
reasons rendered the action intelligible in his eyes. Others have
stressed that the concept of ‘an intention with which a person
acted’ has a teleological dimension that does not, in their
view, reduce to the concept of ‘causal guidance by the agent's
reasons.’ But the view that reason explanations are somehow
causal explanations remains the dominant position. Finally, recent
discussions have revived interest in important questions about the
nature of intention and its distinctiveness as a mental state, and
about the norms governing rational intending.

Shared Agency,0.571143388748169,0.8261284828186035,"

Sometimes individuals act together, and sometimes they act
independently of one another. It’s a distinction that matters. You
are likely to make more headway in a difficult task working with
others; and even if little progress is made, there’s at least the
comfort and solidarity that comes with a collective undertaking. Or,
to take a very different perspective, the realization (or delusion)
that the many bits of rudeness one has been suffering of late are part
of a concerted effort can be of significance in identifying
what one is up against: the accumulation of grievances (no doubt well
catalogued) is seen, not as an unfortunate coincidence of affronts
stemming from various quarters, but as itself a product of a unified
exercise of agency. A paranoid conspiracy theorist is not usually to
be taken seriously. But he does get right that it certainly would be
awful, for example, if everyone were out to get him and were
working together to do so.

Shared agency also has important normative implications. Institutions
or laws established by everyone acting together have a status
different from those that are, for example, imposed on a people by the
dictates of one. And the nature of justification, be it epistemic or
practical, might depend on whether it figures in the context of a
shared enterprise. No wonder, then, that shared activity and intention
is of interest for a variety of disciplines, including politics,
social science, economics, ethics, law, epistemology (especially
testimony and social epistemology), and psychology.

But what is it to act together? The question has received sustained
discussion in contemporary philosophy of action. Central concerns have
been to explicate the distinctive features of shared agency, and to
investigate the possibility and scope of reduction: can shared agency
be understood in terms of the resources available to us from the study
of individual agency? This entry will focus on some issues most
closely related to the philosophy of action. See the entry on
collective intentionality for a broader discussion.

The Logic of Action,0.8308817148208618,0.8087912201881409,"

In this article we provide a brief overview of the logic of action in philosophy, linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. The logic of action is the formal study of action in which formal languages are the main tool of analysis.

The concept of action is of central interest to many disciplines: the social sciences including economics, the humanities including history and literature, psychology, linguistics, law, computer science, artificial intelligence, and probably others. In philosophy it has been studied since the beginning because of its importance for epistemology and, particularly, ethics; and since a few decades it is even studied for its own sake. But it is in the logic o faction that action is studied in the most abstract way.

The logic of action began in philosophy. But it has also played a certain role in linguistics. And currently it is of great importance in computer science and artificial intelligence. For our purposes it is natural to separate the accounts of these developments.

Action-based Theories of Perception,0.7753193378448486,0.3811415433883667,"
Action is a means of acquiring perceptual information about the
environment. Turning around, for example, alters your spatial
relations to surrounding objects and, hence, which of their properties
you visually perceive. Moving your hand over an object’s surface
enables you to feel its shape, temperature, and texture. Sniffing and
walking around a room enables you to track down the source of an unpleasant
smell. Active or passive movements of the body can also generate
useful sources of perceptual information (Gibson 1966, 1979). The
pattern of optic flow in the retinal image produced by forward
locomotion, for example, contains information about the direction in
which you are heading, while motion parallax is a “cue”
used by the visual system to estimate the relative distances of
objects in your field of view. In these uncontroversial ways and
others, perception is instrumentally dependent on action. According to
an explanatory framework that Susan Hurley
(1998) dubs the
“Input-Output Picture”, the dependence of perception on
action is purely instrumental:
 Movement can alter sensory inputs and so result in
different perceptions… changes in output are merely a means to
changes in input, on which perception depends directly. (1998:
342) 
The action-based theories of perception, reviewed in this entry,
challenge the Input-Output Picture. They maintain that perception can
also depend in a noninstrumental or constitutive way on
action (or, more generally, on capacities for object-directed motor control). This
position has taken many different forms in the history of philosophy
and psychology. Most action-based theories of perception in the last
300 years, however, have looked to action in order to explain how
vision, in particular, acquires either all or some of
its spatial representational content. Accordingly, these are
the theories on which we shall focus here.
We begin in Section 1 by discussing
George Berkeley’s Towards a New Theory of Vision
(1709), the historical locus classicus of action-based
theories of perception, and one of the most influential texts on
vision ever written. Berkeley argues that the basic or
“proper” deliverance of vision is not an arrangement of
voluminous objects in three-dimensional space, but rather a
two-dimensional manifold of light and color. We then turn to a
discussion of Lotze, Helmholtz, and the local sign
doctrine. The “local signs” were felt cues for the mind to
know what sort of spatial content to imbue visual experience with. For
Lotze, these cues were “inflowing” kinaesthetic feelings
that result from actually moving the eyes, while, for Helmholtz, they
were “outflowing” motor commands sent to move the
eyes.
In Section 2, we discuss sensorimotor
contingency theories, which became prominent in the 20th
century. These views maintain that an ability to predict the sensory
consequences of self-initiated actions is necessary for
perception. Among the motivations for this family of theories is the
problem of visual direction constancy—why do objects
appear to be stationary even though the locations on the retina to
which they reflect light change with every eye movement?—as well
as experiments on adaptation to optical rearrangement devices (ORDs)
and sensory substitution.
Section 3 examines two other
important 20th century theories. According to what we shall
call the motor component theory, efference copies
generated in the oculomotor system and/or proprioceptive feedback from
eye-movements are used together with incoming sensory inputs to
determine the spatial attributes of perceived
objects. Efferent readiness theories, by contrast,
look to the particular ways in which perceptual
states prepare the observer to move and act in relation to
the environment. The modest readiness theory, as we
shall call it, claims that the way an object’s spatial
attributes are represented in visual experience can be modulated by
one or another form of covert action planning. The bold
readiness theory argues for the stronger claim that
perception just is covert readiness for action.
In Section 4, we move to
the disposition theory, most influentially
articulated by Gareth Evans (1982, 1985), but more recently defended
by Rick Grush (2000, 2007). Evans’ theory is, at its core, very
similar to the bold efferent readiness theory. There are some notable
differences, though. Evans’ account is more finely articulated
in some philosophical respects. It also does not posit a reduction of
perception to behavioral dispositions, but rather posits that certain
complicated relations between perceptual input and behavioral provide
spatial content. Grush proposes a very specific theory that is like
Evans’ in that it does not posit a reduction, but unlike
Evans’ view, does not put behavioral dispositions and sensory
input on an undifferentiated footing.

In the quantum realm, there are curious correlations between the
properties of distant systems. An example of such correlations is
provided by the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen/Bohm experiment. The
correlations in the EPR/B experiment strongly suggest that there are
non-local influences between distant systems, i.e., systems between
which no light signal can travel, and indeed orthodox quantum
mechanics and its various interpretations postulate the existence of
such non-locality. Yet, the question of whether the EPR/B correlations
imply non-locality and the exact nature of this non-locality is a
matter of ongoing controversy. Focusing on EPR/B-type experiments, in
this entry we consider the nature of the various kinds of non-locality
postulated by different interpretations of quantum mechanics. Based on
this consideration, we briefly discuss the compatibility of these
interpretations with the special theory of relativity.

Actualism,0.8019979596138,0.5979917049407959,"


Actualism is a widely-held view in the metaphysics of modality.
To understand the thesis of actualism, consider the following example.
Imagine a race of beings — call them ‘Aliens’ —
that is very different from any life-form that exists anywhere in the
universe; different enough, in fact, that no actually existing thing could
have been an Alien, any more than a given gorilla could have been a
fruitfly. Now, even though there are no Aliens, it seems intuitively the
case that there could have been such things. After all, life
might have evolved very differently than the way it did in fact. For
example, if the fundamental physical constants or the laws of evolution
had been slightly different, very different kinds of things might have
existed. So in virtue of what is it true that there could have been Aliens
when in fact there are none, and when, moreover, nothing that exists in
fact could have been an Alien?


To answer this question, a philosopher should try to identify the special
features of the world that are responsible for the truth of claims about
what could have been the case. One group of philosophers,
the possibilists, offers the following answer: ‘It is
possible that there are Aliens’ is true because there are in fact
individuals that could have been Aliens. At first blush, this might appear
directly to contradict the premise that no existing thing could possibly
have been an Alien. The possibilist's thesis, however, is that existence,
or actuality, encompasses only a subset of the things that, in
the broadest sense, are. Rather, in addition to things like us
that actually exist, there are merely possible things —
possible Aliens, for example — that could have existed,
but, as it happens, do not. So there
are such things, but they just happen to exhibit a rather
less robust but nonetheless fully-fledged type of being than we
do. For the possibilist, then, ‘It is possible that there are
Aliens’ is true simply in virtue of the fact that there are
possible-but-nonactual Aliens, i.e., things that could have existed
(but do not) and that would have been Aliens if they had.


Actualists reject this answer; they deny that there are any nonactual
individuals. Actualism is the philosophical position that everything there
is — everything that can in any sense be said to be
— exists, or is actual. Put another way, actualism
denies that there is any kind of being beyond actual existence; to be is
to exist, and to exist is to be actual. Actualism therefore stands in
stark contrast to possibilism, which, as we've seen, takes the things
there are to include possible but non-actual objects.


Of course, actualists will agree that there could have been Aliens.  An
actualist theory, therefore, will be a metaphysical theory that
attempts to account for the truth of claims like ‘It is possible
that there are Aliens’ without appealing to any nonactual objects
whatsoever. What makes actualism so philosophically interesting, is that
there is no obviously correct way to account for the truth of claims like
‘It is possible that there are Aliens’ without appealing to
possible but nonactual objects. In this article, we will clarify the
“possibilist challenge” to actualism in some detail and lay
out the various attempts to meet the challenge and assess their

Adaptationism,0.9803692102432252,0.5765255689620972,"
“Adaptationism” refers to a family of views about the
importance of natural selection in the evolution of organisms, in the
construction of evolutionary explanations, and in defining the goal of
research on evolution.  Advocates of adaptationism or
“adaptationists” view natural selection among
individuals within a population as the only important cause of the evolution
of a trait; they also typically believe that the construction of
explanations based solely on natural selection to be the most fruitful
way of making progress in evolutionary biology and that this endeavor
addresses the most important goal of evolutionary biology, which is to
understand the evolution of adaptations. An important alternative
approach, “pluralism”, invokes historical contingency and
developmental and genetic constraints, in addition to natural
selection, as important causes of the evolution of a trait. Advocates
of pluralism, or “pluralists” often also argue that the
attempt to construct a natural-selective explanation of a trait is not
the most fruitful way to make explanatory progress and that
understanding adaptation is just one of several important questions in
evolutionary biology. The “debate” over adaptationism is
commonly understood to be the back-and-forth between adaptationists
and pluralists.


Biologists and philosophers have recently made three important
contributions that have led to better understanding of this
debate. First, they have delineated the differences among various
“flavors” of adaptationism; this has helped clarify the
biological and philosophical stakes of the debate. Second, they have
clarified standards of evidence for and against adaptationist claims;
this provides a clearer understanding of how to structure an empirical
test of a claim about natural selection and what implications the
results of the test have in regard to adaptationism. This
clarification has the potential, not yet fully realized, to improve
both the practice of science and the philosophical understanding of
this practice. Third, there is improved understanding of the potential
role of non-selective influences on trait evolution.

Jane Addams,0.614011287689209,0.7386316061019897,"


Jane Addams (1860–1935) can be labeled the first woman “public
philosopher” in United States history. The dynamics of canon
formation, however, resulted in her philosophical work being largely
ignored until the
 1990s.[1]
 Addams is best known for her pioneering work in the social
settlement movement—the radical arm of the progressive movement
whose adherents so embraced the ideals of progressivism that they
chose to live as neighbors in oppressed communities to learn from and
help the marginalized members of society. Although her activism and
accomplishments were widely lauded by her contemporaries,
Addams’ work was mapped onto conventional gender understandings:
male philosophers such as John Dewey, William James, and George
Herbert Mead were regarded as providing original progressive thought
while Addams was seen as brilliantly administering their
theories. Recent work by feminist philosophers and historians has
revealed that Addams was far more than a competent technician. Her
dozen published books and over 500 articles display a robust
intellectual interplay between experience and reflection in the
American pragmatist tradition. The near half-century that she lived
and worked as the leader of the Chicago social settlement, Hull House,
gave her an opportunity to bring her commitment to social improvement,
feminism, diversity, and peace to direct action. These experiences
provided the foundation for an engaging philosophical
perspective. Addams viewed her settlement work as a grand
epistemological endeavor but in the process she also never forgot the
humanity of her neighbors.  Addams was indeed a public
philosopher—one who was not afraid to get her hands dirty.


Addams’ philosophy combined feminist sensibilities with an
unwavering commitment to social improvement through cooperative
efforts. Although she sympathized with feminists, socialists, and
pacifists, Addams refused to be labeled. This refusal was pragmatic
rather than ideological. Addams’ commitment to social cohesion
and cooperation prompted her to eschew what she perceived as divisive
distinctions. Active democratic social progress was so essential to
Addams that she did not want to alienate any group of people from the
conversation or from the participation necessary for effective
inclusive deliberation. Addams carefully varied her rhetorical
approach to engage a variety of constituencies, which makes the
identification of her social philosophy challenging. Accordingly,
Addams did not intend to engage in philosophical narratives removed
from social improvement, but neither did she intend to pursue social
activism without theorizing about the wider implications of her
work. In this respect, through her integration of theory and action,
Addams carried pragmatism to its logical conclusion, developing an
applied philosophy immersed in social action. Thus Addams’
writing is replete with examples from her Hull House experience
addressing atypical topics for philosophic discourse such as garbage
collection, immigrant folk stories, and prostitution. For those
steeped in traditional philosophy, it is easy to dismiss Addams’
writings as non-philosophical if the full sweep of her projects and
subsequent analysis is not considered.  For those who persevere,
Addams offers a rich social and political philosophy built on respect
and understanding that is refreshing in its faith in the potential for
collective progress.


Recovering Jane Addams as a philosopher requires appreciating the
dynamic between theory and action that is reflected in her writing.  A
wellspring of nascent feminist philosophical insight can be found in
Addams’ work. Addams’ ethical philosophy was guided by the
notion of sympathetic knowledge that she described as “the only
way of approach to any human problem” (NCA 7). Sympathetic
knowledge is a mingling of epistemology and ethics: knowing one
another better reinforces the common connection of people such that
the potential for caring and empathetic moral actions
increases. Addams not only theorized about this idea, but she lived
it. Sympathetic knowledge underwrote Addams’ approach to the
diversity that she confronted in the immigrant neighborhood
surrounding Hull House and allowed her to develop a precursor to
contemporary feminist standpoint epistemology. The diversity and
oppression in the neighborhood surrounding Hull House was staggering
(HHM). Addams’ leadership among the American pragmatists in
understanding the poor and oppressed resulted in a more radical form
of pragmatism than that of Dewey and James, a social philosophy imbued
with a class and gender consciousness. Ultimately, Addams exemplifies
and theorizes about what today is described as care
ethics. Addams’ version of care ethics does not privatize caring
relationships in metaphors of parent-child relationships, but
assertively extends the notion to the community and society. Jane
Addams was an original feminist thinker.

Theodor W. Adorno,0.6441424489021301,0.7708679437637329,"


Theodor W. Adorno was one of the most important philosophers and
social critics in Germany after World War II. Although less well known
among anglophone philosophers than his contemporary Hans-Georg
Gadamer, Adorno had even greater influence on scholars and
intellectuals in postwar Germany. In the 1960s he was the most
prominent challenger to both Sir Karl Popper's philosophy of science
and Martin Heidegger's philosophy of existence. Jürgen Habermas,
Germany's foremost social philosopher after 1970, was Adorno's student
and assistant. The scope of Adorno's influence stems from the
interdisciplinary character of his research and of the Frankfurt
School to which he belonged. It also stems from the thoroughness with
which he examined Western philosophical traditions, especially from
Kant onward, and the radicalness to his critique of contemporary
Western society. He was a seminal social philosopher and a leading
member of the first generation of Critical Theory.


Unreliable translations hampered the initial reception of Adorno's
published work in English speaking countries. Since the 1990s,
however, better translations have appeared, along with newly
translated lectures and other posthumous works that are still being
published. These materials not only facilitate an emerging assessment
of his work in epistemology and ethics but also strengthen an already
advanced reception of his work in aesthetics and cultural theory.

Advance Directives and Substitute Decision-Making,0.5284761786460876,0.7661501169204712,"


There is a rough consensus in medical ethics on the requirement of
respect for patient
 autonomy:
physicians must ultimately defer to patients' own decisions about the
management of their medical care, so long as the patients are deemed to
have sufficient mental capacity to make the decisions in question. For
patients who lack the relevant decision-making capacity at the time the
decision is to be made, a need arises for surrogate decision-making:
someone else must be entrusted to decide on their behalf. Patients who
formerly possessed the relevant decision-making capacity might have
anticipated the loss of capacity and left instructions for how future
medical decisions ought to be made. Such instructions are called an
advance directive. One type of advance directive simply designates who
the surrogate decision-maker should be. A more substantive advance
directive, often called a living will, specifies particular principles
or considerations meant to guide the surrogate's decisions in various
circumstances, for example, “Do not prolong my life if I enter
persistent vegetative state,” or “I am a fighter: do not
discontinue life-sustaining treatment no matter what happens to
me.”

This general framework opens up a number of ethical issues. I shall set
aside here a foundational issue that is a subject of its own
encyclopedia article: What are the criteria for
 decision-making capacity?
 These must be specified before we can establish, on any
given occasion, whether there would be any need at all for
decision-making by a third party (with the aid of an advance directive
or not). Assuming we have settled, using the appropriate criteria, that
surrogate decision-making is indeed called for, the following main
issues arise:


Q1. Who should be the surrogate decision-maker?

 
 Q2. On what basis should the surrogate make the decision? What
considerations should she take into account? And, more
specifically,

 Q2a. Should the advance directive be honored?



This article focuses on philosophical contributions to the last two
sets of questions.

Ancient Skepticism,0.6787363886833191,0.4177696406841278,"


The Greek word skepsis means investigation. By calling
themselves skeptics, the ancient skeptics thus describe themselves as
investigators. They also call themselves ‘those who
suspend’ (ephektikoi), thereby signaling that their
investigations lead them to suspension of judgment. They do not put
forward theories, and they do not deny that knowledge can be found. At
its core, ancient skepticism is a way of life devoted to
inquiry. Also, it is as much concerned with belief as with
knowledge. As long as knowledge has not been attained, the skeptics
aim not to affirm anything. This gives rise to their most
controversial ambition: a life without belief.


Ancient skepticism is, for the most part, a phenomenon of
Post-Classical, Hellenistic philosophy. The Academic and Pyrrhonian
skeptical movements begin roughly in the third century BCE, and end
with Sextus Empiricus in the second century CE. Hellenistic philosophy
is a large-scale conversation, not unlike philosophy today. The
skeptics (among them Pyrrho, Timon, Arcesilaus, Carneades,
Aenesidemus, and Sextus Empiricus) do engage with Pre-Socratic
philosophy, Socrates, Protagorean relativism, Plato, and perhaps
Aristotle. But their contemporary and principal interlocutors are
Epicureans, Stoics, Cynics, and Megarian logicians (cf. Long 2006,
ch. 4 and 5).

The Concept of the Aesthetic,0.5785554647445679,0.4857315123081207,"


Introduced into the philosophical lexicon during the Eighteenth
Century, the term ‘aesthetic’ has come to be used to
designate, among other things, a kind of object, a kind of judgment, a
kind of attitude, a kind of experience, and a kind of value. For the
most part, aesthetic theories have divided over
questions particular to one or another of these designations:
whether artworks are necessarily aesthetic objects; how to square the
allegedly perceptual basis of aesthetic judgments with the fact that
we give reasons in support of them; how best to capture the elusive
contrast between an aesthetic attitude and a practical one; whether to
define aesthetic experience according to its phenomenological or
representational content; how best to understand the relation between
aesthetic value and aesthetic experience. But questions of
more general nature have lately arisen, and these have tended
to have a skeptical cast: whether any use of ‘aesthetic’
may be explicated without appeal to some other; whether agreement
respecting any use is sufficient to ground meaningful theoretical
agreement or disagreement; whether the term ultimately answers to any
legitimate philosophical purpose that justifies its inclusion in the
lexicon. The skepticism expressed by such general questions did not
begin to take hold until the later part of the 20th century, and this
fact prompts the question whether (a) the concept of the aesthetic is
inherently problematic and it is only recently that we have managed to
see that it is, or (b) the concept is fine and it is only recently
that we have become muddled enough to imagine otherwise. Adjudicating
between these possibilities requires a vantage from which to take in
both early and late theorizing on aesthetic matters.

19th Century Romantic Aesthetics,0.5365254282951355,0.4210775494575501,"

Understanding romantic aesthetics is not a simple undertaking for
reasons that are internal to the nature of the subject. Distinguished
scholars, such as Arthur Lovejoy, Northrop Frye and Isaiah Berlin,
have remarked on the notorious challenges facing any attempt to define
romanticism. Lovejoy, for example, claimed that romanticism is
“the scandal of literary history and criticism” (1960:
234). The main difficulty in studying the romantics, according to him,
is the lack of any “single real entity, or type of entity”
that the concept “romanticism” designates. Lovejoy
concluded, “the word ‘romantic’ has come to mean so
many things that, by itself, it means nothing” (1960: 235).

The more specific task of characterizing romantic aesthetics
adds to these difficulties an air of paradox. Conventionally,
“aesthetics” refers to a theory concerning beauty and art
or the branch of philosophy that studies these topics. However, many
of the romantics rejected the identification of aesthetics with a
circumscribed domain of human life that is separated from the
practical and theoretical domains of life. The most characteristic
romantic commitment is to the idea that the character of art and
beauty and of our engagement with them should shape all aspects of
human life. Being fundamental to human existence, beauty and art
should be a central ingredient not only in a philosophical or artistic
life, but also in the lives of ordinary men and women. Another
challenge for any attempt to characterize romantic aesthetics lies in
the fact that most of the romantics were poets and artists whose views
of art and beauty are, for the most part, to be found not in developed
theoretical accounts, but in fragments, aphorisms and poems, which are
often more elusive and suggestive than conclusive.

Nevertheless, in spite of these challenges the task of characterizing
romantic aesthetics is neither impossible nor undesirable, as numerous
thinkers responding to Lovejoy’s radical skepticism have noted.
While warning against a reductive definition of romanticism, Berlin,
for example, still heralded the need for a general
characterization:


[Although] one does…have a certain sympathy with
Lovejoy’s despair…[he is] in this instance mistaken.
There was a romantic movement; it did have something which
was central to it; it did create a great revolution in consciousness,
and it is important to discover what it is. (1999: 20) 


Recent attempts to characterize romanticism and to stress its
contemporary relevance follow this path. Instead of overlooking the
undeniable differences between the variety of romanticisms of
different nations that Lovejoy had stressed, such studies attempt to
characterize romanticism, not in terms of a single definition, a
specific time, or a specific place, but in terms of “particular
philosophical questions and concerns” (Nassar 2014b: 10,
n.9).

This entry approaches the topic along similar lines in order to
identify a cluster of related questions, concerns, themes, and
approaches that are characteristics of the aesthetics of various
romanticisms, and in order to bring out what is “romantic”
in them. In lieu of a chronological, geographical, national, or
figure-based organization, the following is structured
thematically—it focuses on the central romantic commitment to
the primacy of aesthetics (introduced in
 §1),
 and offers different philosophical explanations of this primacy (in
the remaining sections).

While the German, British and French romantics are all considered, the
central protagonists in the following are the German romantics. Two
reasons explain this focus: first, because it has paved the way for
the other romanticisms, German romanticism has a pride of place among
the different national romanticisms (cf. Lovejoy 1960 and Berlin
1999). Second, the aesthetic outlook that was developed in Germany
roughly between 1796 and 1801–02—the period that
corresponds to the heyday of what is known as “Early
Romanticism”
 [Frühromantik][1]—offers
 the most philosophical expression of romanticism since it is
grounded primarily in the epistemological, metaphysical, ethical, and
political concerns that the German romantics discerned in the
aftermath of Kant’s
 philosophy.[2]
 The entry elaborates on these concerns and explains how they shed
light on the romantic understanding of beauty and art as fundamental
in human life.

Aesthetic Judgment,0.5803016424179077,0.477746844291687,"


Beauty is an important part of our lives. Ugliness too. It is no
surprise then that philosophers since antiquity have been interested
in our experiences of and judgments about beauty and ugliness. They
have tried to understand the nature of these experiences and
judgments, and they have also wanted to know whether these experiences
and judgments were legitimate. Both these projects took a sharpened
form in the 20th century, when this part of our lives came under a
sustained attack in both European and North American intellectual circles.
Much of the discourse about beauty since the 18th century had deployed
a notion of the “aesthetic”, and so that notion in
particular came in for criticism. This disdain for the aesthetic may
have roots in a broader cultural Puritanism, which fears the
connection between the aesthetic and pleasure. Even to suggest, in the
recent climate, that an artwork might be good because it is
pleasurable, as opposed to cognitively, morally or politically
beneficial, is to court derision. The 20th century was not kind
to the notions of beauty or the aesthetic. Nevertheless, there were always some thinkers
— philosophers, as well as others in the study of particular
arts — who persisted in thinking seriously about beauty and the
aesthetic. In the first part of this essay, we will look at the
particularly rich account of judgments of beauty given to us by
Immanuel Kant. The notion of a “judgment of taste” is
central to Kant's account and also to virtually everyone working in
traditional aesthetics; so we begin by examining Kant's
characterization of the judgment of taste. In the second part, we look
at the issues that 20th century thinkers raised. We end by
drawing on Kant's account of the judgment of taste to consider whether
the notion of the aesthetic is viable.

Beardsley's Aesthetics,0.5753076672554016,0.4881506860256195,"


Monroe Beardsley (1915–1985) was born and raised in Bridgeport,
Connecticut, and educated at Yale University (B.A. 1936, Ph.D. 1939).
He taught at a number of colleges and universities, including Mt.
Holyoke College and Yale University, but most of his career was spent
at Swarthmore College (22 years) and Temple University (16 years).


Beardsley is best known for his work in aesthetics—and this
article will deal exclusively with his work in that area—but he
was an extremely intellectually curious man, and published articles in
a number of areas, including the philosophy of history, action theory,
and the history of modern philosophy.


Three books and a number of articles form the core of Beardsley's work
in aesthetics. Of the books, the first, Aesthetics: Problems in the
Philosophy of Criticism (1958; reissued with a postscript, 1981), is
by far the most substantial, comprehensive, and influential. More than
that, it's also the first systematic, well-argued, and critically
informed philosophy of art in the analytic tradition. Given the wide
range of topics covered in Aesthetics, the intelligent and
philosophically informed treatment accorded them, the historically
unprecedented nature of the work, and its effect on subsequent
developments in the field, a number of philosophers, including some of
Beardsley's critics, have argued that Aesthetics is the most
impressive and important book of 20th century analytic
aesthetics.

The Possibility of Criticism, the second of the three books,
is more modest in scope and less groundbreaking. Exclusively concerned
with literary criticism, it limits itself to four problems: the
‘self-sufficiency’ of a literary text, the nature of
literary interpretation, judging literary texts, and bad poetry.


The last of the books, The Aesthetic Point of View, is a
collection of papers, most old, some new. Fourteen papers, largely on
the nature of the aesthetic and art criticism, are reprinted, and six
new pieces are added. The new pieces are of special interest, because
they constitute Beardsley's final word on the topics covered, and the
topics are themselves central ones: aesthetic experience, the
definition of art, judgments of value, reasons in art criticism,
artists' intentions and interpretation, and art and culture.

18th Century British Aesthetics,0.5663895606994629,0.4487771689891815,"

18th-century British aesthetics addressed itself to a
variety of questions: What is taste? What is beauty? Is there is a
standard of taste and of beauty? What is the relation between the
beauty of nature and that of artistic representation? What is the
relation between one fine art and another? How ought the fine arts be
ranked one against another? What is the nature of the sublime and
ought it be ranked with the beautiful? What is the nature of genius
and what is its relation to taste?

Although none of these questions was peripheral to
18th-century British aesthetics, not all were equally
central. The question on which the others tended to turn was the
question concerning the nature of taste. But this question was not
simply how best generally to define taste. Everyone seems to have been
in at least rough agreement with Joseph Addison’s early
definition of taste as “that faculty of soul, which discerns the
beauties of an author with pleasure, and the imperfections with
dislike” (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 409). But agreeing with
Addison meant agreeing only to use “taste” to refer to
that faculty and to acknowledge that such discerning has something of
the phenomenology of sensation. The central question was how to think
of taste so defined. Is taste a higher, cognitive faculty, akin
perhaps to reason, with objects of a primarily intellectual nature? Or
is it a lower, bodily faculty, more akin to the five bodily senses,
and with objects of a primarily material nature? The major theories
that arose in response to this question can be grouped into three main
lineages: (a) internal-sense theories, of which the theories of
Shaftesbury (1711), Hutcheson (1725), Hume (1739–40, 1751, and
1757) and Reid (1785) are representative; (b) imagination theories, of
which theories of Addison (1712) and Burke (1757/59) are
representative; and (c) association theories, of which the theories of
Gerard (1757) and Alison (1790) are representative.

Collingwood's Aesthetics,0.6578011512756348,0.5346559882164001,"

R. G. Collingwood (1889–1943) was primarily a general philosopher and philosopher of history, and considered his work in aesthetics—the principal work being his The Principles of Art (1938)—as secondary. But the work in aesthetics has enjoyed a persistent readership that continues into the present. In the years after WWII he was probably the most widely read and influential aesthetician to have written in English since Addison, Hutcheson and Hume (not counting Ruskin as an aesthetician), and to this day continues to make his way into anthologies as a principal proponent of the expressive theory of art. In the field of the philosophy of history, Collingwood famously held the doctrine of ‘Re-enactment’: since the subject is human beings in action, the historian cannot achieve understanding by describing what happened from an external point of view, but must elicit in the reader’s own mind the thoughts that were taking place in the principal actors involved in historical events. Similarly, the aesthetic procedure is one whereby the artist and spectator jointly come to realize, to come to know, certain mental states. Art is fundamentally expression. Collingwood saw two main obstacles to general understanding and acceptance of this: First, the word ‘art’ has surreptitiously acquired multiple meanings among ordinary folk which should be disentangled; second, a philosophical theory of the phenomenon of expression is needed to show that it is an essential part of the life of the mind, not just a special activity that poets go in for. (Collingwood actually published an earlier theory of art in Outlines of a Philosophy of Art, but came to regard that theory as mistaken, superseded by the one in Principles of Art; what follows, and all references, concern the latter only).

Croce's Aesthetics,0.5886417627334595,0.4930848777294159,"


The Neapolitan Benedetto Croce (1860–1952) was a dominant figure
in the first half of the twentieth century in aesthetics and literary
criticism, as well as philosophy generally.  But his fame did not
last, either in Italy or in the English speaking world. He did not
lack promulgators and willing translators into English: H. Carr was an
early example of the former, R. G. Collingwood was both, and
D. Ainslie did the latter service for most of Croce’s principal
works.  But his star rapidly declined after the Second World
War. Indeed it is hard to find a figure whose reputation has fallen so
far and so quickly; this is somewhat unfair not least because
Collingwood’s aesthetics is still studied, when its main ideas
are mostly borrowed from Croce. The causes are a matter for
speculation, but two are likely. First, Croce’s general
philosophy was very much of the preceding century. As the idealistic
and historicist systems of Bradley, Green, and Joachim were in Britain
superseded by Russell and Ayer and analytical philosophy,
Croce’s system was swept away by new ideas on the
continent—from Heidegger on the one hand to deconstructionism on
the other. Second, Croce’s manner of presentation in his famous
early works now seems, not to put too fine a point on it, dismissively
dogmatic; it is full of the youthful conviction and fury that seldom
wears well. On certain key points, opposing positions are
characterized as foolish, or as confused expressions of simple truths
that only waited upon Croce to articulate properly. Of course, these
dismissals carry some weight—Croce’s reading is prodigious
and there is far more insight beneath the words than initially meets
the eye—but unless the reader were already convinced that here
at last is the truth, their sheer number and vehemence will arouse
mistrust. And since the early works, along with his long running
editorship of the journal La Critica, rocketed him to such
fame and admiration, whereas later years were devoted among other
things to battling with while being tolerated by fascists, it’s
not surprising that he never quite lost this habit.


Nevertheless, Croce’s signal contribution to
aesthetics—that art is expression—can be more or less be
detached from the surrounding philosophy and polemics. In what
follows, we will first see the doctrine as connected to its original
philosophical context, then we will attempt to snip the
connections.

The Definition of Art,0.5789771676063538,0.4998781085014343,"

The definition of art is controversial in contemporary philosophy.
Whether art can be defined has also been a matter of controversy.  The
philosophical usefulness of a definition of art has also been
debated.
 Contemporary definitions can be classified with respect to the
dimensions of art they emphasize. One distinctively modern,
conventionalist, sort of definition focuses on art’s
institutional features, emphasizing the way art changes over time,
modern works that appear to break radically with all traditional art,
the relational properties of artworks that depend on works’
relations to art history, art genres, etc. – more broadly, on
the undeniable heterogeneity of the class of artworks.  The more
traditional, less conventionalist sort of definition defended in
contemporary philosophy makes use of a broader, more traditional
concept of aesthetic properties that includes more than art-relational
ones, and puts more emphasis on art’s pan-cultural and
trans-historical characteristics – in sum, on commonalities
across the class of artworks. Hybrid definitions aim to do justice to
both the traditional aesthetic dimension as well as to the
institutional and art-historical dimensions of art, while privileging

Dewey's Aesthetics,0.6081106066703796,0.7756164073944092,"

John Dewey is well known for his work in logic, scientific inquiry,
and philosophy of education. His fame is based largely on his
membership in the school of American Pragmatists of which Charles
Sanders Peirce and William James were the leading early figures. He
has also had a great deal of influence in aesthetics and the
philosophy of art. His work Art as Experience (1934) is
regarded by many as one of the most important contributions to this
area in the 20th century. Yet it is not as widely discussed
as that evaluation would indicate. There are several reasons for this.


First, although Dewey seems to write in an almost folksy style, his
philosophical prose is often difficult and dense. Second, the book
early on had the misfortune of receiving two reviews that negatively
impacted its reception. The first, by an avowed follower, Stephen
Pepper, complained that it was not truly pragmatist and that Dewey had
reverted to an earlier Hegelianism (Pepper 1939). The second, by
Benedetto Croce, seemed to confirm this (Croce 1948). Croce, widely
seen as Hegelian himself, saw so many similarities between Dewey's
work and his own that he accused Dewey of lifting his ideas. Dewey
(1948) insisted otherwise, but the sense that there was something too
Hegelian in Art as Experience remained. This did not stop
many philosophers, educators, and other intellectuals from producing
works in aesthetic theory that were strongly influenced by Dewey. Even
before Art as Experience Dewey's writings on aesthetics and
art influenced, and were influenced by, such writers as: Mary Mullen
(1923), who taught seminars on aesthetics and was Associate Director
of Education for the Barnes Foundation; Lawrence Buermeyer (1924), who
was another Associate Director of Education at the Barnes Foundation;
Albert Barnes (1928); and Thomas Munro (1928). After the book's
publication his followers included Irwin Edman (1939), Stephen Pepper
(1939, 1945, 1953), Horace Kallen (1942), Thomas Munro again (numerous
books) and Van Meter Ames (1947, 1953). Art historian Meyer Schapiro
was one of his students.

However, in the 1950s there was an analytic revolution in
English-speaking aesthetics. Prior aesthetic theories were considered
to be too speculative and unclear. Dewey's work was caught up in this
condemnation. Arnold Isenberg (1987, orig. 1950) for instance, in a
founding document of analytic aesthetics, dismissed Art as
Experience as a “hodgepodge of conflicting methods and
undisciplined speculations,” (p. 128) although he found it full
of profound suggestions. Dewey's theories of expression and creativity
were particular targets of analytic attack. Dewey's was among the
views singled out in a general critique of expression as a defining
characteristic of art, although often his own distinctive theory was
ignored in the process. A situation followed, and continued well into
the 1980s, in which, according to one editor of The Journal of
Aesthetics and Art Criticism, Dewey's aesthetics was virtually
ignored (Fisher 1989). While Monroe Beardsley, one of the most
important late 20th century aestheticians, kept an interest
in Dewey alive (1958, 1975, 1982), particularly in his discussions of
aesthetic experience, other major figures, including Arthur Danto,
Mary Mothersill and Richard Wollheim, completely ignored him. Nelson
Goodman may be a partial exception (Freeland 2001). Goodman certainly
shared with Dewey a conviction that art and science are close in many
ways and, like Dewey, he replaced the question “what is
art?” with “when is art?” They also both took a
naturalist approach to the arts. However, Goodman, who never refers to
Dewey in his Languages of Art (1976), saw art in terms of
languages and other symbol systems, whereas Dewey saw it in terms of
experience. Joseph Margolis (1980) is perhaps the most important
contemporary aesthetician coming out of the analytic school to take
Dewey seriously, having a natural affinity to pragmatist ways of
thought. His idea that works of art are culturally emergent but
physically embodied entities is Deweyan in spirit, as is his
insistence on a robust relativist theory of interpretation. However,
Margolis seldom refers to Dewey and, although he believes himself
closer to Dewey's “Hegelianism” than to Peirce's
“Kantianism,” he finds Peirce more interesting. He also
faults Dewey for not being an historicist (1999). Another contemporary
American aesthetician, Arnold Berleant, has continuously developed
themes similar to Dewey's, for example, in his concepts of the
“aesthetic field” and “engagement.”

Environmental Aesthetics,0.5657129883766174,0.4906459152698517,"


Environmental aesthetics is a relatively new sub-field of
philosophical aesthetics. It arose within analytic aesthetics in the
last third of the twentieth century. Prior to its emergence, aesthetics
within the analytic tradition was largely concerned with philosophy
of art. Environmental aesthetics originated as a reaction to this
emphasis, pursuing instead the investigation of the aesthetic
appreciation of natural environments. Since its early stages, the scope
of environmental aesthetics has broadened to include not simply natural
environments but also human and human-influenced ones. At the same
time, the discipline has also come to include the examination of that
which falls within such environments, giving rise to what is called the
aesthetics of everyday life. This area involves the aesthetics of not
only more common objects and environments, but also a range of everyday
activities. Thus, early in the twenty-first century, environmental
aesthetics embraces the study of the aesthetic significance of almost
everything other than art.

Existentialist Aesthetics,0.5528860092163086,0.5235584974288939,"


Many of the philosophers commonly described as
“existentialist” have made original and decisive
contributions to aesthetic thinking. In most cases, a substantial
involvement in artistic practice (as novelists, playwrights or
musicians) nourished their thinking on aesthetic experience. This is
true already of two of the major philosophers who inspired
20th century existentialism: Søren Kierkegaard and
Friedrich Nietzsche. For reasons of space, however, this entry is
restricted to 20th century thinkers who at one point or
another accepted the tag “existentialist” as an accurate
characterisation of their thinking, and who have made the most
significant contributions to aesthetics: Albert Camus, Simone de
Beauvoir, Gabriel Marcel, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Jean-Paul
Sartre.


Existentialism owes its name to its emphasis on
“existence”. For all the thinkers mentioned above,
regardless of their differences, existence indicates the special way in
which human beings are in the world, in contrast with other beings. For
the existentialists, the human being is “more” than what it
is: not only does the human being know that it is but, on the
basis of this fundamental knowledge, this being can choose how
it will “use” its own being, and thus how it will relate to
the world. “Existence” is thus closely related to freedom
in the sense of an active engagement in the world. This metaphysical
theory regarding human freedom leads into a distinct approach to
ontology, i.e., the study of the different ways of being.


This ontological aspect of existentialism ties it to aesthetic
considerations. Existentialist thinkers believe that, under certain
conditions, freedom grants the human being the capacity of revealing
essential features of the world and of the beings in it. Since artistic
practice is one of the prime examples of free human activity, it is
therefore also one of the privileged modes of revealing what the world
is about. However, since most of the existentialists followed Nietzsche
in the conviction that “God is dead,” art's power of
revelation is to a large extent devoted to expressing the absurdity of
the human condition. For the existentialists, the world is no longer
hospitable to our human desire for meaning and order.


This ontological approach to art underpins some of the most
distinctive features of existentialist aesthetics. Because it views art
in terms of “revelation,” it favors representative art and
is suspicious of formalist avant-gardes. And because it grounds
expressive capacity on the notion of human freedom, it demands that
artistic representation be strongly informed by ethical and political
concerns. This is why at times existentialist aesthetics can appear out
of touch with the aesthetic avant-gardes of the 20th
century.


Some of the existentialists wrote substantial analyses about
different art forms and how they can be compared, elaborating something
like a “system of the arts” similar to that of classical
aesthetics. All the existentialist thinkers, with the exception of
Merleau-Ponty, thought that the form that best enabled the revelatory
potential of art was the theatre, followed by the novel.

Feminist Aesthetics,0.6201756000518799,0.6964058876037598,"

“Feminist aesthetics” does not label a variety of
aesthetics in the way that, for example, the terms “virtue
theory” and “naturalized epistemology” qualify types
of ethics and theories of knowledge. Rather, to refer to feminist
aesthetics is to identify a set of perspectives that pursue certain
questions about philosophical theories and assumptions regarding art
and aesthetic categories. Feminists in general have concluded that,
despite the seemingly neutral and inclusive theoretical language of
philosophy, virtually all areas of the discipline bear the mark of
gender in their basic conceptual frameworks. Those who work in
aesthetics inquire into the ways that gender influences the formation
of ideas about art, artists, and aesthetic value. Feminist
perspectives in aesthetics are also attuned to the cultural influences
that exert power over subjectivity: the ways that art both reflects
and perpetuates the social formation of gender, sexuality, and
identity, and the extent to which all of those features are framed by
factors such as race, national origin, social position, and historical
situation. These interests have broadened from early analyses of norms
governing female appearance to include consideration of the disabled
body and of transgender identities. 

Aesthetics is by nature rather more interdisciplinary than are some
other areas of philosophy, for this field articulates with art
practices and the critical disciplines. Contributions to feminist
perspectives in aesthetics have been made not only by philosophers but
also by art historians, musicologists, and theorists of literature,
film, and performance, and by artists themselves. There are practical
implications for the discoveries that emerge from feminist
investigations: analyses of the historical conceptual frameworks that
govern aesthetics and philosophy of art help to account for the
disparate numbers of men and women who have been influential
practitioners of the arts, for example. Philosophical theories adapted
by feminists also have been highly influential in the critical
interpretation of art and popular culture and sometimes in the
development of contemporary artistic practice. Feminist aesthetics
pursues inquiries and critiques that reach into the values at the very
foundations of philosophy, examining concepts that often do not
directly refer to men and women at all, yet whose hierarchies are
imbued with gendered significance.

The following sections each begin with critiques of theoretical
traditions and feminist interventions and alternatives. These
endeavors lead not only to revisions of philosophical positions but
also to the dissemination of feminist perspectives in areas collateral
to traditional aesthetics. This progression is especially noted in the
final sections of the essay, so to an extent the order of the topics
below reflects the development of interests--from early work to the
most recent--within feminist approaches to aesthetics.

18th Century French Aesthetics,0.5753676891326904,0.4621510207653046,"


A new kind of discourse on art, beauty, and human sensibilities
emerged in the 18th Century, for which Baumgarten, in
Germany, coined the term ‘aesthetics’. The discourse was
influenced by the general philosophical problems discussed during the
Enlightenment, with its ideals of liberty, democracy, and scientific
inquiry. The present entry examines the French contribution to
this new field.


Britain, and especially Scotland, led the way, not only in the work of
its empiricists such as Hutcheson and Hume but also in the work of
Reid, who resisted the empiricist tradition. These philosophers raised
issues and put forward ideas that influenced thinkers in Europe with
an interest in art and our relationship to nature. A discussion of the
British contribution to aesthetics in the 18th century can
 be found in the entry
 18th Century British Aesthetics.
 By contrast, Germany's achievement is to be found in an enduring
program to systematize a new domain of knowledge, and this can be
found in work starting with Baumgarten and culminating in Kant. A
discussion of the German contribution to aesthetics in the
 18th century can be found in the entry
 18th Century German Aesthetics.


The French contribution to aesthetics in the 18th century
was primarily the result of two factors: (1) the extensive use of
French as a lingua franca among learned people after the
decline of Latin and prior to the growing dominance of English, and (2)
the existence of an intellectual culture of writing and theorizing. The
term ‘philosopher’ in 18th-century France was not applied
only to people such as Descartes and Locke, but also to a new group of
writers able to combine intellectual analysis, literature and social
commentary. Voltaire and Diderot were two distinguished such figures;
both had a passion for writing theatrical plays and stories and both
wished to understand and advance society. Neither wrote a treatise on
aesthetics, but they contributed to its development more than the other
French writers of this period by systematically working through the
different areas and levels of human thought. In their writings, and
those of others, Reason was no longer seen as a faculty whose sole
purpose was to identify the truth, but increasingly as a faculty
of testing and evaluating judgments, including the judgments of
sentiment, taste and individuality. For the first time, perhaps, art
became as significant for humanity as scientific thought, or rather,
the complete dissociation between the pursuits of art and science
started to break down.

Gadamer's Aesthetics,0.5496194958686829,0.4782617688179016,"


Gadamer (1900–2002) does not provide an account of the aesthetic
in any customary sense. His approach to art runs, in many ways,
against conventional philosophical expectations. Aesthetic qualities
are not debated in the manner of the analytic tradition of modern
philosophy, nor does he concern himself overtly with the problems of
aesthetic pleasure. Gadamer’s approach to aesthetic experience stands
squarely in the phenomenological tradition. He is primarily concerned
with the place of art in our experience of the world. Furthermore, his
approach to aesthetic theory is one of those rare intellectual
achievements which are simultaneously deconstructive and
constructive. He dismantles elements of the grand tradition of
Platonic, Kantian and Hegelian aesthetics and yet offers a
phenomenological reconstruction of many of the central insights of
that tradition to demonstrate its continuing relevance to our
contemporary experience of art. Gadamer is primarily concerned with
the cognitive dimension of such experience, with what artworks
address and what they put at issue. This makes for a flexible
philosophical approach capable of ranging freely over a number of art
forms and styles, discussing both the singularity of works and their
broader significance. The approach is clearly hermeneutical in that it
endeavours to reacquaint us with those received meanings and
preoccupations which underlie our experience of art. Openly
influenced by Heidegger, the later essays on language and poetry in
particular, Gadamer’s aesthetics is far from traditional. His key
claims are: 

Aesthetics is not the study of specific types of subjective
pleasures derived from art. It is a study of what objectively informs
our subjective awareness of art.
Hermeneutical aesthetics seeks to break through the pleasurable
distractions of aesthetic consciousness in order to disclose the
cultural and linguistic realities that manifest themselves within
it.
Hermeneutical aesthetics presupposes phenomenological involvement
with the subject matters of art rather than disinterested
detachment.
Hermeneutical aesthetics regards aesthetic appearance not as a
distraction from the real but as the vehicle through which real
subject matters reveal themselves. It overturns the notion that
artworks are at one remove from reality.
Hermeneutical aesthetics is dialogical in character. It recognises
that practitioner and theoretician share in bringing a subject matter
to light and plays down any theory/practice division in the
arts. Interpretation is a means to a work’s realisation.
Hermeneutical aesthetics is not a theory of art per se,
more a set of practical contemplative notes for enhancing one’s
encounter with art. The end of hermeneutical aesthetics is not to
arrive at a concept of art but to deepen our experience of art. In
hermeneutical aesthetics, theory is deployed to deepen contemplation
of artworks rather than to categorise their nature.
Gadamer’s aesthetics is deeply respectful of art’s ability to
disrupt and challenge customary expectations. It attributes an ethical
significance to art as being able to reveal the limitations of fixed
cultural expectancy and to open the spectator towards the other and
the different.



In this entry, we discuss the leading arguments which inform these
contentions.

18th Century German Aesthetics,0.5793907046318054,0.4531720578670502,"


The philosophical discipline of aesthetics did not receive its name
until 1735, when the twenty-one year old Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten
introduced it in his Halle master's thesis to mean epistêmê
aisthetikê, or the science of what is sensed and imagined
(Baumgarten, Meditationes §CXVI, pp. 86–7). But
Baumgarten's denomination of the field was an adult baptism: without
the benefit of a name, aesthetics had been part of philosophy since
Plato attacked the educational value of many forms of art in
the Republic and Aristotle briefly defended them in his
fragmentary Poetics. In particular, Aristotle defended the
arts from Plato's charge that they are cognitively useless, trading in
mere images of particulars rather than universal truths, by arguing
that it is precisely the arts, or at least poetry, that deliver
universal truths in a readily graspable form, unlike, for example,
history, which deals merely with particular facts
(Aristotle, Poetics, chapter 9, 1451a37–1451b10). And
if experience of the arts can reveal important moral truths, then it
can also be important to the development of morality, the other pole
of Plato's doubts. Some variant of this response to Plato was the core
of aesthetics through much of subsequent philosophical history, and
indeed continued to be central to aesthetics through much of the
twentieth century. In the eighteenth century, however, two alternative
responses to Plato were introduced.  One may be regarded as taking up
Aristotle's idea in the Poetics that ""katharsis,""
purification or purgation, of the emotions of fear and pity, is a
valuable part of our response to a tragedy; this led to an emphasis on
the emotional impact of aesthetic experience that was downplayed in
the cognitivist tradition. This line of thought was emphasized by
Jean-Baptiste Du Bos in his Critical Reflections on Poetry,
Painting, and Music, published in France in 1719 and widely known
throughout Europe even before it was translated into other languages.
The other innovation was the idea that our response to beauty, whether
in nature or in art, is a free play of our mental powers that is
intrinsically pleasurable, and thus needs no epistemological or moral
justification, although it may in fact have epistemological and moral
benefits. This line of thought was introduced in Britain in Joseph
Addison's 1712 Spectator essays on “The Pleasures of
the Imagination,” and developed by subsequent Scottish writers
such as Francis Hutcheson, Henry Home (Lord Kames), and Alexander
Gerard. It was only slowly received in Germany, hinted at by Moses
Mendelssohn in the late 1750s, who also took up Du Bos' emphasis on
the emotional impact of aesthetic experience, but then made its first
sustained appearance in the emphasis on the pleasure of the unhindered
activity of our powers of representation in some of the entries in
Johann Georg Sulzer's Allgemeine Theorie der schönen Künste
(1771–74), e.g., the entries on “beauty” and
“taste” (Sulzer, Allgemeine Theorie, vol.  II,
pp. 371–85, at p. 371, and “Schön (Schöne Künste),”
vol. IV, pp. 305–19, at p. 307). It became central to the
aesthetic theories of Kant and Schiller in the Critique of the
Power of Judgment (1790) and the Letters on the Aesthetic
Education of Mankind (1795). This article will chronicle the
interaction between the traditional theory of aesthetic experience as
a special form of the cognition of truth and the newer theories of
aesthetic experience as a free play of cognitive (and sometimes other)
mental powers and as a vicarious experience of emotions in
eighteenth-century Germany.

Nelson Goodman has certainly been one of the most influential figures
in contemporary aesthetics and analytic philosophy in general (in
addition to aesthetics, his contributions cover the areas of applied
logic, metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of science). His
Languages of Art (first published in 1968 [Goodman 1976]),
together with Ernst Gombrich’s Art and Illusion (1960)
and Richard Wollheim’s Art and Its Objects (1968),
represents a fundamental turning point in the analytic approach to
artistic issues in Anglo-American philosophy. His often unorthodox
take on art is part of a general approach to knowledge and reality,
and is always pervasively informed by his cognitivism, nominalism,
relativism, and constructivism. From Languages of Art and
subsequent works, a general view of the arts as contributing to the
understanding and indeed to the building of the realities we live in
emerges. Ultimately, in Goodman’s view, art is not sharply
distinguished, in goals and means, from science and ordinary
experience. Paintings, musical sonatas, dances, etc. all are symbols
that classify parts of reality for us, as do such things as scientific
theories and what makes up common, ordinary knowledge.

G.W.F. Hegel's aesthetics, or philosophy of art, forms part of
the extraordinarily rich German aesthetic tradition that stretches from
J.J. Winckelmann's Thoughts on the Imitation of the Painting

Laocoon (1766) through Immanuel Kant's Critique of

Schiller, and his own thesis of the “end of art” (or what
has been taken to be that thesis) has itself been the focus of close
attention by Heidegger and Adorno. Hegel's philosophy of art is a
wide ranging account of beauty in art, the historical development of
art, and the individual arts of architecture, sculpture, painting,
music and poetry. It contains distinctive and influential analyses of

Heidegger is against the modern tradition of philosophical

Heidegger's critique of aesthetics and his advocacy of art

providing a brief overview of Heidegger's philosophical stand
against aesthetics, for art. Section 2 explains
Heidegger's philosophical critique of aesthetics, showing why he
thinks aesthetics follows from modern “subjectivism” and
leads to late-modern “enframing,” historical worldviews
Heidegger seeks to transcend from within—in part by way of his
phenomenological interpretations of art. Section 3 clarifies this
attempt to transcend modern aesthetics from within, focusing on the way
Heidegger seeks to build a phenomenological bridge from a particular
(“ontic”) work of art by Vincent van Gogh to the
ontological truth of art in general. In this way, as we will see,
Heidegger seeks to show how art can help lead us into a genuinely

Although the Japanese have been producing great art and writing about

corresponding to Western “aesthetics” did not get underway
until the nineteenth century. A good way to survey the broader field

the course of the tradition, all of them before aesthetics was
formally established as a discipline: namely, mono no aware

beauty), sabi (rustic patina), yūgen

and kire (cutting). (This last Japanese term is pronounced as
two evenly accented syllables, the second of which rhymes with the

If aesthetics is the philosophical inquiry into art and beauty (or a
contemporary surrogate for beauty, e.g. aesthetic value), the striking
feature of Plato's dialogues is that he devotes as much time as he
does to both topics and yet treats them oppositely. Art, mostly as
represented by poetry, is closer to a greatest danger than any other
phenomenon Plato speaks of, while beauty is close to a greatest good.
Can there be such a thing as “Plato's aesthetics” that
contains both positions?

To the literal-minded the very phrase “Plato's aesthetics”
refers to an impossibility, given that this area of philosophy only
came to be identified in the last few centuries. But even those who
take aesthetics more broadly and permit the term may find something
exploratory in Plato's treatments of art and beauty. He might be best
described as seeking to discover the vocabulary and issues of
aesthetics. For this reason Plato's readers will not find a single
aesthetic theory in the dialogues. For the same reason they are
uniquely situated to watch core concepts of aesthetics being defined:
beauty, imitation, inspiration.

The subject calls for care. If perennially footnoted by later
philosophers Plato has also been perennially thumbnailed.
Clichés accompany his name. It is worth going slowly through
the main topics of Plato's aesthetics—not in the search
for some surprising theory unlike anything that has been said, but so
that background shading and details may emerge, for a result that
perhaps resembles the customary synopses of his thought as a human
face resembles the cartoon reduction of it.

In what follows, citations to passages in Plato use “Stephanus
pages.” These are based on a sixteenth-century edition of
Plato’s works. The page numbers in that edition, together with
the letters a–e, have become standard. Almost every translation
of Plato includes the Stephanus page numbers and letters in the
margins, or at the top of the page. Thus, “Symposium

assembled from his lectures on aesthetics given to a small group of
students in private rooms in Cambridge in the summer of 1938
(Wittgenstein 1966) and we have G. E. Moore's record of some of
Wittgenstein's lectures in the period 1930–33 (Moore 1972).  Of
Wittgenstein's own writings, we find remarks on literature, poetry,
architecture, the visual arts, and especially music and the philosophy
of culture more broadly scattered throughout his writings on the
philosophies of language, mind, mathematics, and philosophical method,
as well as in his more personal notebooks; a number of these are
collected in Culture and Value (Wittgenstein 1980).  In
another sense, it is not surprising at all, precisely because
of the central position he gave to the aesthetic: in writing about
questions of meaning, as he did throughout his life from the earliest
pre-Tractatus (Wittgenstein 1961, 1971) writings to the
remarks from the last weeks of his life in On Certainty
(Wittgenstein 1969), in writing about perception, as he did in Part II
of Philosophical Investigations (Wittgenstein 1958),
Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology, Volumes I and II
(Wittgenstein 1980a, 1980b), and Last Writings on the Philosophy
of Psychology, volume I (Wittgenstein 1982), and in writing about
the contextual prerequisites to the emergence of sense in his
philosophy of mind and language (in (Wittgenstein 1958) as well as his
writings on the philosophy of mathematics), he was writing—if at
one remove—about aesthetics. For questions of meaning, of
perception, and of sense are all clearly central to aesthetic
experience, and the writing he undertook on these subjects holds
significance for questions of artistic meaning and interpretation that
is still being explored and articulated (Lewis 2004, Dauber and Jost
2003, Gibson and Huemer 2004).  Wittgenstein placed the aesthetic, not
on a distant periphery of philosophical subjects, but then not at the
center of a grouping of such interests either—for then it would
still be a subject area unto itself. Rather, Wittgenstein interweaves
the subject's various and variegated strands throughout his writing in
a way that in some cases shows explicitly, and in many more cases
suggests implicitly, the layered interconnections between aesthetic
considerations and every other area of philosophy upon which he
wrote. In this article I will, then, look at the record we have of his
lectures on the topic (which, predictably, take up many connections to
extra-aesthetic issues along the way), but throughout try to offer a
reading of them that situates them into the larger context of his
philosophical work.

Aesthetics of the Everyday,0.5658990740776062,0.4906792044639587,"
In the history of Western aesthetics, the subject matters that
received attention ranged from natural objects and phenomena, built
structures, utilitarian objects, and human actions, to what is today
regarded as the fine arts. However, beginning with the nineteenth
century, the discourse has become increasingly focused on the fine
arts. This narrowing attention occurred despite the prominence of the
aesthetic attitude theory in modern aesthetics, according to which
there is virtually no limit to what can become a source of aesthetic
experience. The tendency to equate aesthetics with the philosophy of
art became widespread in twentieth century aesthetics, particularly
within the Anglo-American tradition.
Challenges to this rather limited scope of aesthetics began during
the latter half of the twentieth century with a renewed interest in
nature and environment, followed by the exploration of popular
arts. Everyday aesthetics continues this trajectory of widening scope
by including objects, events, and activities that constitute
people’s daily life. However, it is more accurate to
characterize this recent development as restoring the scope
of aesthetics rather than opening a new arena.
In addition, although not formulated as aesthetic theories, many
cultural traditions outside the Western sphere are concerned with the
aesthetics of daily life. In some cultural traditions, such as Inuit
and Navajo, aesthetic considerations are thoroughly integrated in
daily activities, including making things such as tools. Even in other
traditions, such as Japanese and Chinese, with distinctive art-making
practices of paintings, literature, theater, and the like, aesthetic
practices permeate people’s daily life. In these cultural
traditions, there may not be a need for an aesthetics discourse
specifically devoted to everyday life.
Thus, the perception that everyday aesthetics is a new frontier of
aesthetics discourse needs to be situated in the context of late
twentieth-century Anglo-American aesthetics. That is, it was
established as a reaction against what was considered to be an undue
restriction on the scope of aesthetics. It aims to give due regard to
the entirety of people’s multi-faceted aesthetic life, including various ingredients of everyday life: artifacts of daily use, chores
around the house, interactions with other people, and quotidian
activities such as eating, walking, and bathing. Everyday aesthetics
also seeks to liberate aesthetic inquiry from an almost exclusive
focus on beauty (and to a certain extent sublimity) characteristic of
modern Western aesthetics. It includes within its purview those
qualities that pervade everyday experience, such as pretty, cute,
messy, gaudy, tasteful, dirty, lively, monotonous, to name only a
few. These items and qualities are characterized by their ubiquitous
presence in the daily life of people, regardless of their occupation,
lifestyle, economic status, social class, cultural background, and
familiarity with art.
Beyond attending to more items and qualities for its inquiry,
everyday aesthetics also raises theoretical issues that have not
received adequate attention from the prevailing mainstream Western
aesthetics. These include: indeterminate identity of the object of
aesthetic experience due to a lack of an institutionally agreed-upon
framing; changes and modifications everyday objects go through;
general anonymity of the designer and creator, as well as absence of
any clear authorship behind everyday objects; bodily engagements with
objects and activities and their pragmatic outcome; perceived lack of
criteria for aesthetic judgments. By raising these issues, everyday
aesthetics challenges long-held assumptions underlying art-centered
aesthetics discourse. However, everyday aesthetics advocates pose
these challenges not as a way of invalidating the established
aesthetics discourse. Rather, they are meant to shed new light on the
prevailing discourse. Just as new forms of art often introduce
qualities and values that were not considered before and enrich the
artworld, as suggested by Arthur Danto, everyday aesthetics proposes
to help develop the overall aesthetics discourse by adding new avenues
of inquiry. Accordingly, the account of everyday aesthetics that
follows will focus on these issues that have been raised to illuminate
and challenge the prevailing aesthetics discourse in contemporary
Western philosophy.

Affirmative Action,0.4786052405834198,0.7843818068504333,"


“Affirmative action” means positive steps taken to
increase the representation of women and minorities in areas of
employment, education, and culture from which they have been
historically excluded. When those steps involve preferential
selection—selection on the basis of race, gender, or
ethnicity—affirmative action generates intense controversy.


The development, defense, and contestation of preferential affirmative
action has proceeded along two paths. One has been legal and
administrative as courts, legislatures, and executive departments of
government have made and applied rules requiring affirmative action.
The other has been the path of public debate, where the practice of
preferential treatment has spawned a vast literature, pro and con.
Often enough, the two paths have failed to make adequate contact, with
the public quarrels not always very securely anchored in any existing
legal basis or practice.


The ebb and flow of public controversy over affirmative action can
be pictured as two spikes on a line, the first spike representing a
period of passionate debate that began around 1972 and tapered off
after 1980, and the second indicating a resurgence of debate in the
1990s leading up to Supreme Court’s decisions in 2003 and 2016
upholding certain kinds of affirmative action. The first spike
encompassed controversy about gender and racial preferences alike. This
is because in the beginning affirmative action was as much about the
factory, the firehouse, and the corporate suite as about the college
campus. The second spike represents a quarrel about race and ethnicity.
This is because the burning issue at the turn of the twentieth-first
century is about college
 admissions. At selective colleges, women
need no boost; African-Americans and Hispanics
 do.[1]

Africana Philosophy,0.463908463716507,0.5499284863471985,"


“Africana philosophy” is the name for an emergent and
still developing field of ideas and idea-spaces, intellectual
endeavors, discourses, and discursive networks within and beyond
academic philosophy that was recognized as such by national and
international organizations of professional philosophers, including the
American Philosophical Association, starting in the 1980s. Thus, the
name does not refer to a particular philosophy, philosophical system,
method, or tradition. Rather, Africana philosophy is a
third-order, metaphilosophical, umbrella-concept used to bring
organizing oversight to various efforts of
philosophizing—that is, activities of reflective,
critical thinking and articulation and aesthetic
expression—engaged in by persons and peoples African and of
African descent who were and are indigenous residents of continental
Africa and residents of the many African Diasporas worldwide. In all
cases the point of much of the philosophizings has been to confer
meaningful orderings on individual and shared living and on natural and
social worlds while resolving recurrent, emergent, and
radically disruptive challenges to existence so as to survive,
endure, and flourish across successive generations.


The emergent third-order work defining the field has been focused on
identifying for research and teaching, and for further refinements and
new developments of, instances of philosophical articulations and
expressions regarding what has been, and is, of thoughtful, aesthetic
significance to persons African and of African descent. This work has
produced educative catalogings and critical surveys of particular ideas
and idea-spaces; intellectual and aesthetic expressive agendas,
practices, and traditions; and networks of individuals, organizations,
and institutions serving philosophizing in African and
African-descended life-worlds.

African Ethics,0.4698144793510437,0.5569720864295961,"


The ethics of a society is embedded in the ideas and beliefs about
what is right or wrong, what is a good or bad character; it is also
embedded in the conceptions of satisfactory social relations and
attitudes held by the members of the society; it is embedded,
furthermore, in the forms or patterns of behavior that are considered
by the members of the society to bring about social harmony and
cooperative living, justice, and fairness. The ideas and beliefs about
moral conduct are articulated, analyzed, and interpreted by the moral
thinkers of the society.


African societies, as organized and functioning human communities,
have undoubtedly evolved ethical systems—ethical values, principles,
rules—intended to guide social and moral behavior. But, like African
philosophy itself, the ideas and beliefs of the African society that
bear on ethical conduct have not been given elaborate investigation
and clarification and, thus, stand in real need of profound and
extensive analysis and interpretation. In the last three decades or
so, attempts have been made by contemporary African philosophers to
give sustained reflective attention to African moral ideas. This entry
is intended to make some contribution to the understanding of African
ethical thinking.


The entry makes the African moral language its point of departure, for
the language of morality gives insight into the moral thinking or
ideas of the society. The centrality of the notions of character and
moral personhood, which are inspired by the African moral language, is
given a prominent place. The entry points up the social character of
African ethics and highlights its affiliated notions of the ethics of
duty (not of rights) and of the common good. The humanistic
foundations and features of African ethics are extensively
discussed.

African Sage Philosophy,0.4667172431945801,0.5490786433219911,"

“African Sage Philosophy” is the name now commonly given
to the body of thought produced by persons considered wise in African
communities, and more specifically refers to those who seek a rational
foundation for ideas and concepts used to describe and view the world
by critically examining the justification of those ideas and concepts.
The expression acquired its currency from a project conducted by the
late Kenyan philosopher Henry Odera Oruka (1944–1995), whose
primary aim was to establish, with evidence, that critical reflection
upon themes of fundamental importance has always been the concern of a
select few in African societies. These themes involve questions
regarding the nature of the supreme being, the concept of the person,
the meaning of freedom, equality, death and the belief in the
afterlife. The evidence that Oruka collected regarding the rational
elaboration of such themes by indigenous sages is contained in
dialogues, many of which appear in his classic text, Sage
Philosophy: Indigenous Thinkers and Modern Debate on African
Philosophy (1990).

Afterlife,0.6623679399490356,0.5632089972496033,"
One of the points where there is a significant, long-lasting
intersection of the interests of many philosophers with the interests
of many people of all kinds and conditions concerns the nature and
significance of death. How should we understand the mortality of all
living things and, closer to home, how should we understand our own
mortality? Is it possible for persons to survive biological death?
This is a topic that has occupied both analytic and continental
philosophy in the twentieth century (e.g., Fred Feldman, Martin
Heidegger). When the topic of death is ignored or denied in popular
culture, some philosophers, theologians, social and political critics
rail against the inauthentic complacency of ignoring one of the most
important facts about our lives (see, for example, Søren
Kierkegaard’s essay “At a Graveside” or Ernest
Becker’s famous 1974 book, The Denial of Death). But
what precisely are the facts of death? Is it true that a person is
annihilated when she dies, or is there a possibility or even a
likelihood that she may survive death?  Are any of the religious
conceptions of an afterlife promising from a philosophical point of
view?
There are five sections in this entry. In the first, we propose
that beliefs about death and the possibility of an afterlife are of
enduring significance because of our care for persons here and now,
and thus our concern for their future and our own. Just as it is
reasonable to hope that those we love have a fulfilling future in this
life, it is natural to consider whether this life is the only life
there is and, if there is reason to believe that there is an afterlife
(or a life beyond this life), it would be reasonable to hope that this
might involve a new, valuable environment or at least one that is not
Hellish in nature. In the first section we bring to the fore other
reasons why the topic of an afterlife is philosophically
interesting. In sections two and three we consider the concept and
possibility that persons survive death in light of two substantial
philosophies of mind: dualism (section two) and materialism (section
three). Section four addresses the afterlife in terms of empirical
evidence. In section five, reasons are advanced for thinking that the
reasonability of beliefs about an afterlife depends on the
reasonability of metaphysical convictions.

Agency,0.5717194676399231,0.7993255257606506,"
In very general terms, an agent is a being with the capacity to
act, and ‘agency’ denotes the exercise or manifestation of
this capacity. The philosophy of action provides us with a standard
conception and a standard theory of action. The former construes
action in terms of intentionality, the latter explains the
intentionality of action in terms of causation by the agent’s
mental states and events. From this, we obtain a standard conception
and a standard theory of agency. There are alternative conceptions of
agency, and it has been argued that the standard theory fails to
capture agency (or distinctively human agency). Further, it seems that
genuine agency can be exhibited by beings that are not capable of
intentional action, and it has been argued that agency can and should
be explained without reference to causally efficacious mental states
and events.
Debates about the nature of agency have flourished over the past
few decades in philosophy and in other areas of research (including
psychology, cognitive neuroscience, social science, and
anthropology). In philosophy, the nature of agency is an important
issue in the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of psychology, the
debates on free will and moral responsibility, in ethics, meta-ethics,
and in the debates on the nature of reasons and practical
rationality. For the most part, this entry focuses on conceptual and
metaphysical questions concerning the nature of agency. In the final
sections, it provides an overview of empirically informed accounts of
the sense of agency and of various empirical challenges to the
commonsense assumption that our reasons and our conscious intentions
make a real difference to how we act.

The agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction is widely and rightly
regarded as a philosophically important one. Unfortunately, the
distinction is often drawn in different and mutually incompatible
ways. The agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction has historically
been drawn three main ways: the ‘principle-based
distinction’, the ‘reason-statement-based
distinction’ and the ‘perspective-based
distinction’. Each of these approaches has its own distinctive
vices (Sections 1–3). However, a slightly modified version of
the historically influential principle-based approach seems to avoid
most if not all of these vices (Section 4). The distinction so
understood differs from numerous other distinctions with which it
might easily be confused (Section 5). Finally, the distinction so
drawn is important to normative theorizing for a variety of reasons
(Section 6).

The purpose of this entry is to explore how atheism and agnosticism
are related to theism and, more importantly, to each other. This

Settling this issue, at least for the purposes of this entry, will set
the stage for discussing an important distinction between global
atheism and local atheism, which in turn will be helpful for
distinguishing different forms of agnosticism. Examination of an
argument in support of a modest form of agnosticism will ensue,
followed by discussion of three arguments for atheism and one argument
against a more ambitious form of agnosticism.

Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim,0.5707625150680542,0.23863044381141665,"

The intellectual biography of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von
Nettesheim (1486–1535) provides us with significant proof of a
cultural crisis in the Renaissance. The most striking aspect of his
heritage is the seemingly paradoxical coexistence of a comprehensive
treatise on magic and occult arts, De occulta philosophia libri
tres (Three Books on Occult Philosophy), written in
1510, but then reworked, substantially enlarged, and finally published
in 1533, and a rigorous refutation of all products of human reason,
De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum et artium atque
excellentia verbi Dei declamatio invectiva (On the
Uncertainty and Vanity of the Arts and Sciences: An Invective
Declamation), printed in 1530. Esoteric literature and
inquisitorial handbooks invariably quoted Agrippa, the celebrated (or
execrated) Archimagus; bibliographies on skepticism granted
him a long lasting, but not entirely deserved, reputation as one
“who professed to overturn all the science” (Naudé
1644: 44–45). Actually, both works, as well as all of
Agrippa’s other writings, are clearly defined moments in a
broader philosophical, religious, and moral meditation on the social
significance of learning in his own time. The “paradox”
with which Agrippa challenges his readers lies precisely in the
simultaneous presence of two speculative concerns, which are scattered
in different texts, but which express, in spite of their apparent
inconsistency, a complex cultural and religious project. De
vanitate performs the epistemological function of the pars
destruens, identifying the causes and the historical
responsibilities for the general spiritual wreckage of Christian
society, and introducing the proposal contained in the pars
construens. De occulta philosophia, recovering
“true magic” in the framework of Neoplatonic metaphysics
and Hermetic theology, offers humankind a wonder-working knowledge,
one which is able to restore human cognitive and practical
capacities.

In order to understand the internal coherence of Agrippa’s
intellectual journey, his entire oeuvre has to be taken into
account. The task is made more difficult because of his specific
writing strategy, which entailed hiding his true purposes beneath a
mound of borrowed material and erratic juxtapositions. This style of
thought and exposition requires Agrippa’s readers to piece
together his “scattered meaning” (dispersa
intentio) and to search for the theoretical message which is
knowingly concealed within an unsystematic exposition. The literary
technique of spreading knowledge in disguise, typical of the
sapiential tradition, turned out to be increasingly important for most
Renaissance intellectuals, who were “forced to create spaces for
themselves by merging learning with prophecy” (Celenza 2001:
128). In addition, Agrippa composed his texts by gathering a wide
range of concepts and quotations from ancient and contemporary
sources, which were removed from their original context and
re-composed in a new explanatory structure. Such a way of
de-constructing and re-constructing his cultural models should be
considered in the light of Agrippa’s ideological program. By
“re-writing” his sources, he uncovered presuppositions and
implications, which the sources themselves often left unsaid, and he
connected together, in a single coherent design, arguments and points
of view which remained separate in contemporary discussions. In this
way, he added a “political” meaning to the new text which
was not present in the purely cultural or religious critique put
forward by his sources. This emphasis on the civic function of
philosophy can be regarded as the most characteristic and
“original” element in Agrippa’s works.

Akan Philosophy of the Person,0.4733354449272156,0.562130868434906,"


The culture of the Akan people of West Africa dates from before the
13th century. Like other long-established cultures the world over, the
Akan have developed a rich conceptual system complete with
metaphysical, moral, and epistemological aspects. Of particular
interest is the Akan conception of persons, a conception that
informs a variety of social institutions, practices, and judgments
about personal identity, moral responsibility, and the proper
relationship both among individuals and between individuals and
community.


This overview presents the Akan conception of persons as seen by two
major contemporary Akan philosophers, Kwasi Wiredu and Kwame
Gyekye. These scholars present two very different accounts of the
concept, particularly with respect to the relationship between social
recognition and innate characteristics to personhood. Examining the
Akan conception of personhood from these two different perspectives
highlights both the richness of the conception as well as the myriad
ways in which the resulting conception contrasts with Western
conceptions. Among those contrasts are four on which we focus below:
(1) the continuous nature of personhood, (2) the means by which
individuals achieve full personhood, and the implications of this
conception of personhood for (3) the relationship between individuals
and the community and (4) the Akan understanding of responsibility and
freedom.


The debate between Wiredu and Gyekye provides insights regarding not
just the substance of the conception of personhood, but also the way
empirical evidence can be used to inform philosophical analysis. In
this particular case, the Akan view of personhood has, like many other
metaphysical and moral conceptions, far-reaching effects on social
practices and institutions. Using facts about these practices and
institutions to reconstruct a conception of personhood underscores
another important general theme in African philosophy: the practical
implications of philosophical principles on everyday life. For the
Akan, judgments about personhood are not matter of merely academic
interest, but play an important role in shaping and supporting their
highly communal social structure. To the extent that the Akan notion
accommodates a common humanity as an innate source of value, it
supports moral equality. At the same time, its emphasis on the social
bases of personhood helps firmly to embed trust, cooperation, and
responsibility to the community in cultural practices. The Akan
philosophy of persons thus represents an attempt to resolve questions
of identity, freedom, and morality in favor of a communalistic way of
life that has evolved as a rational adaptation to the exigencies of
survival under harsh conditions.

Weakness of Will,0.5920537710189819,0.8216175436973572,"

Julie chose b over a, even though she
    knew b was more expensive than a.



There is nothing puzzling about Julie's choice. Perhaps Julie was 
choosing among vacation options, and b was a week's vacation
in Paris, while a was a week's vacation in Peoria. In any 
event, Julie evidently took the overall merits of b to 
outweigh those of a, even if b was inferior from a 
financial standpoint.

Jimmy opted for d over c, despite his judging
    c to be a healthier choice than d.



Again, we find Jimmy's decision unremarkable. Perhaps c and 
d were competing dessert options: c, let us 
suppose, was a dish of dry Wheaties, rich in fiber and whole grain, 
whereas d was a gossamer-light yet oh-so-rich Valrhona 
chocolate mousse. Jimmy obviously (and reasonably!) assessed 
d as the better dessert option all things considered, even 
though he knew d was less good for his health than 
c would be. Nothing puzzling about that.

Joseph did f rather than e, even though he was
    convinced that e was the better thing to do all things
    considered.



Here, by contrast, we have a genuinely puzzling case, one we cannot 
make sense of in the same way. Why would Joseph do f when he
assessed e as the superior course of action all things 
considered? Joseph's choice sounds so inexplicable that we might
even query whether the case has been accurately described. If Joseph 
is really freely choosing f over e, we might think 
it questionable that he does genuinely assess e as better 
all things considered. Perhaps he actually takes f to be 
superior (for him, under the circumstances), although he thinks most 
people would opt for e or would say e was a better 
choice.


Our divergent reactions to these three examples point to something 
distinctive about the judgment that one course of action is better 
than another. (Better overall, or better all things 
considered, that is—not simply better in some respect.) Such 
judgments appear to enjoy a special connection to the agent's actions
which other judgments do not possess. We are puzzled by Joseph's 
choice precisely because we expect people's actions—at least 
when freely undertaken—to reflect their overall assessment of 
the merits of the alternative courses of action before them. We 
expect their actions, in other words, to reflect that special 
judgment. And Joseph's—at least as reported 
above—doesn't. When judgment and action are said to have 
diverged in this way, we are often sceptical: we question whether the
agent really held the course of action not taken to be better. And 
even when we accept the description of the case, we find such action 
somehow puzzling, defective, or dubiously intelligible, in a way that
action contrary to one's judgments of financial wisdom (for example) 
is not. We can conclude that the particular judgment contrary to 
which Joseph acts—the judgment that one course of action is 
better than another—has what we can vaguely term a special 
character, in comparison with other judgments such as that one course
of action is healthier than another.


Let us give a name to the assessment of his options contrary to which
Joseph acts. Let us call his judgment that e is a better 
thing to do all things considered Joseph's better judgment. 
(“Better judgment” does not mean “superior 
judgment”; it simply means a judgment as to which option is 
overall better.) Joseph, then, appears to have acted, freely and 
intentionally, contrary to his better judgment. And this is precisely
the phenomenon the philosophical tradition calls “weakness of 
 will.”[1]
 Philosophers have been perplexed by or dubious about such action for 
a very long 
 time.[2]
 Indeed, Plato's Socrates famously denied its possibility in the 
Protagoras. “No one,” he declared, “who 
either knows or believes that there is another possible course of 
action, better than the one he is following, will ever continue on 
his present course” (Protagoras 358b-c). And 
philosophers have been wrestling with the issue ever since. It is not
surprising that weakness of will has such a long and distinguished 
pedigree as a topic of philosophical discussion: it is both an 
intrinsically interesting phenomenon and a topic rich in implications
for our broader theories of action, practical reasoning, rationality,
evaluative judgment, and the interrelations among these.

‘Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi,0.6119524240493774,0.16131101548671722,"
The Greek-Arabic sciences penetrated in the Islamic world during
the 8th and 9th centuries AD due to the massive
activity of the translators and al-Kindi’s vision of knowledge
and also through the exegetical activity of the Aristotelian circle of
Baghdad. From the end of the 10th, throughout the
11th, and up to the beginning of the 12th
centuries, the production of original philosophical literature into
Arabic and Persian became the main stream of the Arabic-Islamic
philosophy, which was by then increasingly distant from the Greek
sources in Arabic translation. Avicenna’s works fully attest
this phenomenon, which prompted a 12th century purist trend
well exemplified in the Muslim West by Averroes’ program of
going back to Aristotle: a similar phenomenon occurred also in the
Muslim East, with Muwaffaq al-Din Muhammad ‘Abd al-Latif ibn
Yusuf al-Baghdadi .
‘Abd al-Latif was a philosopher and polymath who lived
between the Second Crusade (1147–1149 AD) and the end of the
Fifth Crusade (1217–1231 AD). He was born in Baghdad in 1162 and
died there on 9 November 1231 after a pilgrimage of more than forty
years during which he travelled throughout Iraq, Syria and Egypt
looking for a good teacher in philosophy. He grew up in a
Shafi‘i family with excellent links with the Nizamiyya madrasa
and he received a solid education in Islamic sciences. Then he turned
to natural sciences, medicine, philosophy and, critically, to
alchemy. His spasmodic search for knowledge brought him to meet
through their writings Avicenna, al-Ghazali and
al-Suhrawardi. ‘Abd al-Latif had many generous patrons and was
in touch with the most important men of his era including the Saladin
and, in Cairo, Maimonides. Cairo represented for ‘Abd al-Latif
the much-desired goal of his pilgrimage, the place where he finally
met Aristotle and his philosophy as well as that of his commentators
Themistius and Alexander, and where he finally encountered the work of
the greatest Arabic Aristotelian commentator of the East,
al-Farabi. For ‘Abd al-Latif, Cairo also meant the progressive
abandonment of Avicenna’s philosophy, which he had held to be
the only one possible during the earlier years of his
education. ‘Abd al-Latif was a sharp critic, an independent
thinker, and a prodigious writer on philosophy and medicine. His
stated intellectual program was that to go back to the original Greek
works in Arabic translation, and in particular to return to Aristotle
in philosophy and to Hippocrates, via Galen, in medicine, but he was
able to go back to these sources only through the lens of their
reworkings by the philosophers before Avicenna, al-Kindi and
al-Farabi.

We know little that is really reliable about
al-Fârâbî’s life. Abû Nasr
al-Fârâbî was probably born in 870 CE (AH 257) in a
place called Farab or Farayb. In his youth he moved to Iraq and
Baghdad. In 943 CE (AH 331) he went to Syria and Damascus. He may have
gone to Egypt but died in Damascus in December 950 CE or January 951
CE (AH 339). Scholars have disputed his ethnic origin. Some claimed he
was Turkish but more recent research points to him being a
Persian (Rudolph 2012: 363–74). 

Al-Fârâbî had two main interests:

Philosophy and logic in particular. Such interest explains why he
is known as “the second master” (the first one, of course,
being Aristotle) and
Music. His huge Kitâb al-musiqâ
al-kabîr or Great Book of Music is the most
important medieval musical treatise in Islamic lands and also includes
sophisticated philosophical sections.


Beginning in the 1980s, much has happened in Farabian scholarship. New
and better editions of his works as well as new and better
translations have led to deeper studies of his thought and to some
interesting and lively controversies. More current bibliographies
allow for more detailed research. We still lack critical editions,
full English translations—and even, at times, translation in any
language of several texts—as well as a solid introduction to
al-Fârâbî’s philosophy. More research is also
needed to better understand the relation between his philosophical and
musical interests.

Al-Farabi's Philosophy of Society and Religion,0.5169211030006409,0.5319823622703552,"

While al-Farabi does not have a specific term for ‘philosophy of
religion’, he does in fact have one which can more or less
literally be translated as ‘philosophy of society’,
namely, falsafa
 madaniyya.[1]
 Notably, this notion embraces two chief moments. First, in line with
Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, it comprises an
intrinsically anthropological and ethical element; accordingly,
falsafa madaniyya is the part of philosophy dedicated to an
inquiry into the kamal al-insan, the perfection of man, as an
individual. Second, just like Plato’s Politeia and
Aristotle’s Politica, it moreover deals with the
madina, the polis, as a whole, taking into account
its makeup and administration. However, it does so strictly from two
angles: it assesses the madina and its regime with respect to
their success, on the one hand, in guiding citizens towards their
individual perfection and, consequently, towards ultimate happiness;
and on the other hand, in emulating society’s normative model,
namely, the cosmic order, through the makeup of the city.

It is precisely in this connection that religion, milla, as
al-Farabi views it, has its place. According to him, religion is
suited to direct the members of society towards human perfection and
thus to contribute simultaneously to the attainment of individual
happiness and the well-being of the city. As a consequence, on
al-Farabi’s account, religion is essentially an instrument or a
craft intended for application; it cannot be considered a sphere of
knowledge, wisdom, and truth on its own. This notion of religion and
its place within the frame of falsafa madaniyya had a
tremendous impact on subsequent thinkers in the Islamic
world—such as Ibn Bajja, Ibn Tufayl, and Ibn Rushd—as well
as on the manner in which al-Farabi’s thought and, more
particularly, what is usually referred to as his ‘political
philosophy’ have been assessed in Western historiography. In
order to get a clearer idea of these issues, they shall be examined in
the sequence just indicated: from the foundation, al-Farabi’s
philosophy of society, across the principle of similitude determining
the relation of man, society, and cosmos, towards religion and the art
of ruling.

Al-Farabi's Psychology and Epistemology,0.6231903433799744,0.18428082764148712,"

Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī (c. 870–950), known
in the Arabic philosophical tradition as the “Second
Master” (al-mu‘allim al-thānī) after
Aristotle, and Alpharabius/Alfarabi in the Latin West tradition, is
one of the major thinkers in the history of Islamic philosophy. He
wrote extensively on logic, philosophy of language, metaphysics,
natural philosophy, ethics, political philosophy, philosophical
psychology and epistemology. His teachings had a strong Aristotelian
background and at the same time a significant Neoplatonic bent. One of
the greatest Islamic thinkers, Avicenna (d. 1037), explicitly admits
in his autobiography his intellectual debt to al-Fārābī
through whom he was able to understand the Metaphysics of
Aristotle. Overall, al-Fārābī became an important
reference within the Islamic intellectual milieu as a source of both
influence and contention.

The precise chronology of al-Fārābī’s works is
difficult to establish. He wrote treatises devoted to the explanation
of Plato and Aristotle, commentaries and paraphrases of
Aristotle’s works, and other treatises where he develops his own
philosophical thought unifying his metaphysical and cosmological views
with his psychology, and even with his political philosophy. His views
concerning psychological and epistemological matters appear in several
places within his treatises. Hence, it is necessary to consider
several works where he clarifies and completes his thoughts on the
matter. The Principles of Existing Things, also known as
The Political Regime (Kitāb al-siyāsa
al-madaniyya), and The Principles and Opinions of the People
of the Virtuous City (Mabādi’ ārā’
ahl al-madīnah al-fāḍilah), are some of
al-Fārābī’s major works where he deals with
psychological topics such as the nature of the soul, its cognitive
capacities, and the doctrine of the intellect. Furthermore, there is
another important treatise where al-Fārābī directly
deals with the intellective faculty, namely, The Treatise on the
Intellect (Risālah fi’l-‘aql). This
work shows signs of the influence of Aristotle’s doctrine of the
soul and its interpretation by Alexander of Aphrodisias. In fact, M.
Geoffroy (2002: 191–231) contends that al-Fārābī
probably never read a complete translation of Aristotle’s On
the Soul but knew it through Alexander’s treatises, mainly
the On the Intellect. Al-Fārābī addresses
epistemological topics such as the understanding of scientific
knowledge and the nature of demonstration and certitude mainly in the
Book of Demonstration (Kitāb al-burhān)
and the Book on the Conditions of Certitude (Kitāb
Šara’iṭ al-yaqīn). In order to cover the

Al-Ghazâlî (c.1056–1111) was one of the
most prominent and influential philosophers, theologians, jurists, and
mystics of Sunni Islam. He was active at a time when Sunni theology had
just passed through its consolidation and entered a period of intense
challenges from Shiite Ismâ’îlite theology and the
Arabic tradition of Aristotelian philosophy (falsafa).
Al-Ghazâlî understood the importance of falsafa
and developed a complex response that rejected and condemned some of
its teachings, while it also allowed him to accept and apply others.
Al-Ghazâlî's critique of twenty positions of
falsafa in his Incoherence of the Philosophers
(Tahâfut al-falâsifa) is a significant landmark in
the history of philosophy as it advances the nominalist critique of
Aristotelian science developed later in 14th century Europe. On the
Arabic and Muslim side al-Ghazâlî's acceptance of demonstration
(apodeixis) led to a much more refined and precise discourse
on epistemology and a flowering of Aristotelian logics and metaphysics.
With al-Ghazâlî begins the successful introduction of
Aristotelianism or rather Avicennism into Muslim theology. After a
period of appropriation of the Greek sciences in the translation
movement from Greek into Arabic and the writings of the
falâsifa up to Avicenna (Ibn Sînâ,
c.980–1037), philosophy and the Greek sciences were
“naturalized” into the discourse of kalâm
and Muslim theology (Sabra 1987). Al-Ghazâlî's
approach to resolving apparent contradictions between reason and
revelation was accepted by almost all later Muslim theologians and had,
via the works of Averroes (Ibn Rushd, 1126–98) and Jewish authors
a significant influence on Latin medieval thinking.

the first self-identified philosopher in the Arabic tradition. He
worked with a group of translators who rendered works of Aristotle,
the Neoplatonists, and Greek mathematicians and scientists into
Arabic.  Al-Kindi’s own treatises, many of them epistles
addressed to members of the caliphal family, depended heavily on these
translations, which included the famous Theology of Aristotle
and Book of Causes, Arabic versions of works by Plotinus and
Proclus.  Al-Kindi’s own thought was suffused with Neoplatonism,
though his main authority in philosophical matters was
Aristotle. Al-Kindi’s philosophical treatises include On
First Philosophy, in which he argues that the world is not
eternal and that God is a simple One.  He also wrote numerous works on
other philosophical topics, especially psychology (including the
well-known On the Intellect) and cosmology. Al-Kindi’s
work in mathematics and the sciences was also extensive, and he was

Joseph Albo (c. 1380–1444) was a Jewish philosopher active in
Christian Spain in the first half of the fifteenth century. His
theoretical work found expression in his well-known opus Sefer
ha-‘Ikkarim [Book of Principles], completed in 1425 in
the town of Soria in the crown of Castile. In this work, Albo
addresses a wide variety of interpretive, theological and
philosophical issues, in a style integrating logical, methodical
analyses with exegetical discussions. Albo’s composition reveals his
exposure to the works of many Jewish philosophers that preceded him,
particularly Maimonides, Hasdai Crescas (Albo’s teacher in his
formative years), and his contemporary, Simeon ben Zemah Duran. The
historical circumstances in which he functioned, especially the
Catholic Church’s persecution of the Jews in Christian Spain, led him
to contribute to the anti-Christian polemic, and apparently also
permitted his exposure to the writings of such Christian philosophers
as Thomas Aquinas.


Albo’s central contribution to the history of Jewish philosophy is his
theory of principles. In his theory, he determines the fundamental,
necessary beliefs that a person must uphold in order to belong to the
system called “divine law.” This theory serves as an
alternative to previous lists of principles, especially the thirteen
principles of faith formulated by Maimonides. Albo’s list includes
only three fundamental beliefs: the existence of God, the divine
origin of the Torah, and reward and punishment. The following
paragraphs will outline Albo’s theory and several of the prominent
issues in his thought, such as the theory of law, the theory of divine
attributes, the theory of human perfection and the theory of

Alcmaeon of Croton was an early Greek medical writer and
philosopher-scientist. His exact date, his relationship to other early
Greek philosopher-scientists, and whether he was primarily a medical
writer/physician or a typical Presocratic cosmologist, are all matters
of controversy. He is likely to have written his book sometime between
500 and 450 BCE. The surviving fragments and testimonia focus
primarily on issues of physiology, psychology, and epistemology and
reveal Alcmaeon to be a thinker of considerable originality. He was
the first to identify the brain as the seat of understanding and to
distinguish understanding from perception. Alcmaeon thought that the
sensory organs were connected to the brain by channels
(poroi) and may have discovered the poroi connecting
the eyes to the brain (i.e. the optic nerve) by excising the eyeball
of an animal, although it is doubtful that he used dissection as a
standard method. He was the first to develop an argument for the
immortality of the soul. He used a political metaphor to define health
and disease: The equality (isonomia) of the opposing powers
which make up the body (e.g., the wet, the dry, the hot, the cold, the
sweet, the bitter etc.) preserves health, whereas the monarchy of any
one of them produces disease. Alcmaeon discussed a wide range of
topics in physiology including sleep, death, and the development of
the embryo. It is unclear whether he also presented a cosmology in
terms of opposing powers, but we do have some testimonia concerning
his views on astronomy. Alcmaeon had considerable impact on his
successors in the Greek philosophical tradition. Aristotle wrote a
treatise responding to him, Plato may have been influenced by his
argument for the immortality of the soul, and both Plato and Philolaus
accepted his view that the brain is the seat of intelligence.

Samuel Alexander,0.655245840549469,0.1010539084672928,"


The Australian-born philosopher Samuel Alexander
(1859–1938) was a prominent figure in early twentieth-century
British philosophy.  He is best known as one of the progenitors of
British Emergentism, a movement that claimed that mind
“emerges” from matter.  Alexander rejected idealism, and
accordingly can also be labelled a “new realist” alongside
the likes of Bertrand Russell; however, unlike other new realists,
Alexander maintained close ties to British idealism throughout his
career, and his ontology is arguably similar to the Absolute Idealism
of F. H. Bradley. Alexander’s mature metaphysical system is set out in
his greatest work Space, Time, and Deity (1920). Alexander
conceives the world as a hierarchy of levels: space and time sit at
the lowest level, and through a process of emergence give rise to the
levels of matter, life, mind, and deity. These levels are pervaded by
“categorical” features of reality, such as substance,
universals, and causality.  Although Alexander is primarily known as a
metaphysician, he also wrote extensively on many other philosophical
topics, including the history of philosophy, ethics, aesthetics, and
the philosophy of religion.  Alexander spent most of his professional
career at the University of Manchester, where he supported various
moves in education and feminism.  On his death, Alexander left his
philosophical papers and correspondence to the John Rylands Library at
Manchester, and this collection constitutes an extremely important
philosophic archive of the period. 


Although Alexander never founded a school of philosophy, his work was
widely celebrated during his lifetime. His friend and colleague John
Laird describes Space, Time, and Deity as “the boldest
adventure in detailed speculative metaphysics” since Hobbes. He
adds that, “Alexander’s reviewers, in general, were profoundly
and gratefully impressed—if they were seldom convinced”
(Laird 1939: 61–5). Alexander has been credited with having an
influence on figures as diverse as the process philosopher A.
N. Whitehead, John Anderson the “father of Australian
philosophy” and his school at Sydney, and the philosopher of
history R. G. Collingwood. A number of studies were produced on
Alexander’s work in the mid-twentieth century, but it has since been
neglected.

Alexander of Aphrodisias,0.6539664268493652,0.10334140807390213,"

Alexander was a Peripatetic philosopher and commentator, active in the
late second and early third century CE. He continued the tradition of
writing close commentaries on Aristotle’s work established in the
first century BCE by Andronicus of Rhodes, the editor of Aristotle’s
‘esoteric’ writings, which were designed for use in his
school only. This tradition reflected a gradual revival of interest in
Aristotle’s philosophy, beginning in the late second century BCE, and
helped to reestablish Aristotle as an active presence in philosophical
debates in later antiquity. Aristotle’s philosophy had fallen into
neglect and disarray in the second generation after his death and
remained in the shadow of the Stoics, Epicureans, and Academic
skeptics throughout the Hellenistic age. Andronicus’ edition of
what was to become the Corpus Aristotelicum consolidated a
renewed interest in Aristotle’s philosophy, albeit in a different
form: active research was replaced by learned elucidations of The
Philosopher’s difficult texts. The commentaries themselves served as
material for the exposition of Aristotle’s work to a restricted circle
of advanced students. Hence each generation of teachers produced their
own commentaries, often relying heavily on their predecessors’
work. Thus, the ‘scholastic’ treatment of authoritative
texts that was to become characteristic of the Middle Ages had already
started in the first century BCE. Alexander, due to his meticulous and
philosophically astute exegesis of a wide range of Aristotle’s texts,
in logic, physics, psychology, metaphysics and ethical topics, became
known as the exemplary commentator throughout later antiquity
and the Arabic tradition. He is often referred to simply as ‘The
Commentator’ (ho exêgetês), later sharing
this title with Avicenna or Averroes. Because there is little evidence
on Alexander’s life and activities, his commentaries and his short
treatises on topics related more or less closely to Aristotelian
doctrine provide all the information we have about him as a
philosopher and a man. As these writings show, his main contemporary
opponents were the Stoics, but there is also some evidence of a
controversy with Galen. Alexander is not only regarded as the best of
the ancient commentators but also as the last strictly Aristotelian
one, whose aim was to present and defend Aristotle’s philosophy as a
coherent whole, well suited to engage contemporary philosophical
discussions. The later commentators were members of the Neoplatonist
schools and were concerned to document the substantial agreement of
Platonic and Aristotelian thought, and to integrate Aristotle’s work
into their Neoplatonist philosophical system. But they continued not
only to consult, discuss, but also to criticize, Alexander’s work, a
fact that probably accounts for its survival.

Algebra,0.9409340023994446,0.7871933579444885,"


Algebra is a branch of mathematics sibling to geometry, analysis
(calculus), number theory, combinatorics, etc. Although algebra has
its roots in numerical domains such as the reals and the complex
numbers, in its full generality it differs from its siblings in
serving no specific mathematical domain. Whereas geometry treats
spatial entities, analysis continuous variation, number theory integer
arithmetic, and combinatorics discrete structures, algebra is equally
applicable to all these and other mathematical domains.


Elementary algebra, in use for centuries and taught in
secondary school, is the arithmetic of indefinite quantities or
variables \(x, y,\ldots\). Whereas the definite sum \(3+4\) evaluates
to the definite quantity 7, the indefinite sum \(x+y\) has no definite
value, yet we can still say that it is always equal to \(y+x\), or to
\(x^2 -y^2\) if and only if \(x\) is either \(-y\) or \(y+1\).



Elementary algebra provides finite ways of managing the infinite.  A
formula such as \(\pi r^2\) for the area of a circle of radius \(r\)
describes infinitely many possible computations, one for each possible
valuation of its variables. A universally true law expresses
infinitely many cases, for example the single equation \(x+y = y+x\)
summarizes the infinitely many facts \(1+2 = 2+1, 3+7 = 7+3\),
etc. The equation \(2x = 4\) selects one number from an infinite set
of possibilities.  And \(y = 2x+3\) expresses the infinitely many
points of the line with slope 2 passing through \((0, 3)\) with a
finite equation whose solutions are exactly those points.



Elementary algebra ordinarily works with real or complex values.
However its general methods, if not always its specific operations and
laws, are equally applicable to other numeric domains such as the
natural numbers, the integers, the integers modulo some integer \(n\),
the rationals, the quaternions, the Gaussian integers, the \(p\)-adic
numbers, and so on. They are also applicable to many nonnumeric
domains such as the subsets of a given set under the operations of
union and intersection, the words over a given alphabet under the
operations of concatenation and reversal, the permutations of a given
set under the operations of composition and inverse, etc. Each
such algebraic structure, or simply algebra,
consists of the set of its elements and operations on those elements
obeying the laws holding in that domain, such as the set \(Z = \{0,
\pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots \}\) of integers under the integer operations
\(x+y\) of addition, \(xy\) of multiplication, and \(-x\), negation,
or the set \(2^X\) of subsets of a set \(X\) under the set operations
\(X\cup Y\) of union, \(X\cap Y\) of intersection, and \(X'\),
complement relative to \(X\).



The laws are often similar but not identical. For example integer
multiplication distributes over addition, \(x(y+z) = xy+xz\), but not
conversely, for example \(2+(3\times 5) = 17\) but \((2+3)\times(2+5)
= 35\). In the analogy that makes intersection the set theoretic
counterpart of multiplication and union that of addition, intersection
distributes over union,

\[
X\cap(Y\cup Z) = (X\cap Y)\cup(X\cap Z),
\]


as for the integers, but unlike the integers union also distributes
over intersection: 

\[
X\cup(Y\cap Z) = (X\cup Y)\cap(X\cup Z).
\]



Whereas elementary algebra is conducted in a fixed algebra,
abstract or modern algebra treats classes of algebras
having certain properties in common, typically those expressible
as equations. The subject, which emerged during the 19th century, is
traditionally introduced via the classes of groups, rings, and fields.
For example any number system under the operations of addition and
subtraction forms an abelian (commutative) group; one then passes
to rings by bringing in multiplication, and further to fields with
division. The common four-function calculator provides the four
functions of the field of reals.



The abstract concept of group in full generality is defined not in
terms of a set of numbers but rather as an arbitrary set equipped with
a binary operation \(xy\), a unary inverse \(x^{-1}\)
of that operation, and a unit \(e\) satisfying certain
equations characteristic of groups. One striking novelty with
groups not encountered in everyday elementary algebra is that their
multiplication need not be abelian: \(xy\) and \(yx\)
can be different! For example the group \(S_3\)
of the six possible permutations of three things is not abelian,
as can be seen by exchanging adjacent pairs of letters in the word
dan. If you exchange the two letters on the left before the
two on the right you get adn and then and, but if
you perform these exchanges in the other order you get dna
and then nda instead of and. Likewise the group of
43,252,003,274,489,856,000 operations on Rubik’s cube and the
infinite group \(SO(3)\) of rotations of the sphere are not abelian,
though the infinite group \(SO(2)\) of rotations of the circle is
abelian. Quaternion multiplication and matrix multiplication is also
noncommutative. Abelian groups are often called additive groups and
their group operation is referred to as addition \(x+y\) rather than
multiplication \(xy\).



Groups, rings and fields only scratch the surface of abstract algebra.
Vector spaces and more generally modules are restricted forms of
rings in which the operands of multiplication are required to be a
scalar and a vector. Monoids generalize groups by dropping inverse;
for example the natural numbers form a monoid but not a group for
want of negation. Boolean algebras abstract the algebra of sets.
Lattices generalize Boolean algebras by dropping complement and
the distributivity laws. 



A number of branches of mathematics have found algebra such an
effective tool that they have spawned algebraic subbranches.
Algebraic logic, algebraic number theory, and algebraic topology
are all heavily studied, while algebraic geometry and algebraic
combinatorics have entire journals devoted to them.



Algebra is of philosophical interest for at least two reasons.
From the perspective of foundations of mathematics, algebra is
strikingly different from other branches of mathematics in both its
domain independence and its close affinity to formal logic. Furthermore
the dichotomy between elementary and abstract algebra reflects a
certain duality in reasoning that Descartes, the inventor of Cartesian
Dualism, would have appreciated, wherein the former deals with the
reasoning process and the latter that which is reasoned about, as
respectively the mind and body of mathematics.



Algebra has also played a significant role in clarifying and
highlighting notions of logic, at the core of exact philosophy
for millennia. The first step away from the Aristotelian logic of
syllogisms towards a more algebraic form of logic was taken by Boole
in an 1847 pamphlet and subsequently in a more detailed treatise,
The Laws of Thought, in 1854. The dichotomy between elementary
algebra and modern algebra then started to appear in the subsequent
development of logic, with logicians strongly divided between the
formalistic approach as espoused by Frege, Peano, and Russell, and the
algebraic approach followed by C. S. Peirce, Schroeder, and Tarski.

The algebra of logic, as an explicit algebraic
system showing the underlying mathematical structure of logic, was
introduced by George Boole (1815–1864) in his book The
Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847).  The methodology initiated
by Boole was successfully continued in the 19th century in
the work of William Stanley Jevons (1835–1882), Charles Sanders
Peirce (1839–1914), Ernst Schröder (1841–1902), among many
others, thereby establishing a tradition in (mathematical) logic. From
Boole's first book until the influence after WWI of the monumental
work Principia Mathematica (1910–1913) by Alfred North
Whitehead (1861–1947) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970),
versions of the algebra of logic were the most developed form of
mathematical logic above all as presented in Schröder's three volumes
Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik (1890–1905).
Furthermore, this tradition motivated the investigations of Leopold
Löwenheim (1878–1957) that eventually gave rise to model theory.
In addition, in 1941, Alfred Tarski (1901–1983) in his paper
“On the calculus of relations” returned to Peirce's
relation algebra as presented in Schröder's Algebra der
Logik. The tradition of the algebra of logic played a key role in
the notion of Logic as Calculus as opposed to the notion of
Logic as Universal Language. Beyond Tarski's algebra of
relations, the influence of the algebraic tradition in logic can be
found in other mathematical theories, such as category theory. However
this influence lies outside the scope of this entry, which is divided
into 10 sections.

Alienation,0.4467743039131165,0.8964981436729431,"


The concept of alienation identifies a distinct kind of psychological
or social ill; namely, one involving a problematic separation between
a self and other that properly belong together. So understood, it
appears to play a largely diagnostic role, perhaps showing that
something is awry with liberal societies and liberal political
philosophy. Theories of alienation typically pick out a subset of
these problematic separations as being of particular importance, and
then offer explanatory accounts of the extent of, and prognosis for,
alienation, so understood. Discussions of alienation are especially,
but not uniquely, associated with Hegelian and Marxist intellectual
traditions.


The present entry clarifies the basic idea of alienation. It
distinguishes alienation from some adjacent concepts; in particular,
from ‘fetishism’ and ‘objectification’. And it
elucidates some conceptual and normative complexities, including: the
distinction between subjective and objective alienation; the need for
a criterion by which candidate separations can be identified as
problematic; and (some aspects of) the relation between alienation and
ethical value. The empirical difficulties often generated by
ostensibly philosophical accounts of alienation are acknowledged, but
not resolved.

Louis Althusser,0.4408769607543945,0.8891507983207703,"


Louis Pierre Althusser (1918–1990) was one of the most
influential Marxist philosophers of the 20th Century. As
they seemed to offer a renewal of Marxist thought as well as to render
Marxism philosophically respectable, the claims he advanced in the
1960s about Marxist philosophy were discussed and debated
worldwide. Due to apparent reversals in his theoretical positions, to
the ill-fated facts of his life, and to the historical fortunes of
Marxism in the late twentieth century, this intense interest in
Althusser’s reading of Marx did not survive the 1970s. Despite the
comparative indifference shown to his work as a whole after these
events, the theory of ideology Althusser developed within it has been
broadly deployed in the social sciences and humanities and has
provided a foundation for much “post-Marxist”
philosophy. In addition, aspects of Althusser’s project have served as
inspiration for Analytic Marxism as well as for Critical Realism and
Philosophy of Language. Though this influence is not always explicit,
Althusser’s work and that of his students continues to inform the
research programs of literary studies, political philosophy, history,
economics, and sociology. In addition, his autobiography has been
subject to much critical attention over the last decade. At present,
Althusser’s philosophy as a whole is undergoing a critical
reevaluation by scholars who have benefited from the anthologization
of hard-to-find and previously unpublished texts and who have begun to
engage with the great mass of writings that remain in his
archives. His concepts are also being increasingly employed by
philosophers, political theorists, and activists who have returned to
Marx and to Marxian analyses in order to explain and to envision
alternatives to our present socio-economic conjuncture.

Altruism,0.5435304045677185,0.7324849963188171,"

Behavior is normally described as altruistic when it is motivated by a
desire to benefit someone other than oneself for that person’s
sake. The term is used as the contrary of
“self-interested” or “selfish” or
“egoistic”—words applied to behavior that is
motivated solely by the desire to benefit oneself.
“Malicious” designates an even greater contrast: it
applies to behavior that expresses a desire to harm others simply for
the sake of harming them.

Sometimes, however, the word is used more broadly to refer to behavior
that benefits others, regardless of its motive. Altruism in this broad
sense might be attributed to certain kinds of non-human
animals—mother bears, for example, who protect their cubs from
attack, and in doing so put their own lives in danger. So used, there
is no implication that such adult bears act “for the sake”
of their young (Sober and Wilson 1998: 6). 

This essay will discuss altruism in the former sense, as behavior
undertaken deliberately to help someone other than the agent for that
other individual’s sake. There is a large and growing empirical
literature on altruism, which asks whether there is an evolutionary or
biological basis for human altruism, and whether
non-human species exhibit it or something similar to it.
These issues are addressed by the entries on
 empirical approaches to moral psychology and
 biological altruism.


It is commonly assumed that we ought to be altruistic at least to some
extent. But to what extent? And is altruism necessarily admirable? Why
should one act for the sake of others and not only for
one’s own sake? For that matter, do people in fact out
of altruism, or is all behavior ultimately self-interested?

Biological Altruism,1.0,0.5794762969017029,"


In evolutionary biology, an organism is said to behave
altruistically when its behaviour benefits other organisms, at a cost
to itself. The costs and benefits are measured in terms of
reproductive fitness, or expected number of offspring. So by
behaving altruistically, an organism reduces the number of offspring it
is likely to produce itself, but boosts the number that other organisms
are likely to produce. This biological notion of altruism is not
identical to the everyday concept. In everyday parlance, an action
would only be called ‘altruistic’ if it was done with the
conscious intention of helping another. But in the biological sense
there is no such requirement. Indeed, some of the most interesting
examples of biological altruism are found among creatures that are
(presumably) not capable of conscious thought at all, e.g. insects. For
the biologist, it is the consequences of an action for reproductive
fitness that determine whether the action counts as altruistic, not the
intentions, if any, with which the action is performed.


Altruistic behaviour is common throughout the animal kingdom,
particularly in species with complex social structures. For example,
vampire bats regularly regurgitate blood and donate it to other members
of their group who have failed to feed that night, ensuring they do not
starve. In numerous bird species, a breeding pair receives help in
raising its young from other ‘helper’ birds, who protect
the nest from predators and help to feed the fledglings. Vervet monkeys
give alarm calls to warn fellow monkeys of the presence of predators,
even though in doing so they attract attention to themselves,
increasing their personal chance of being attacked. In social insect
colonies (ants, wasps, bees and termites), sterile workers devote their
whole lives to caring for the queen, constructing and protecting the
nest, foraging for food, and tending the larvae. Such behaviour is
maximally altruistic: sterile workers obviously do not leave any
offspring of their own—so have personal fitness of zero—but their
actions greatly assist the reproductive efforts of the queen.


From a Darwinian viewpoint, the existence of altruism in nature is
at first sight puzzling, as Darwin himself realized. Natural selection
leads us to expect animals to behave in ways that increase their
own chances of survival and reproduction, not those of others.
But by behaving altruistically an animal reduces its own fitness, so
should be at a selective disadvantage vis-à-vis one which
behaves selfishly. To see this, imagine that some members of a group of
Vervet monkeys give alarm calls when they see predators, but others do
not. Other things being equal, the latter will have an advantage. By
selfishly refusing to give an alarm call, a monkey can reduce the
chance that it will itself be attacked, while at the same time
benefiting from the alarm calls of others. So we should expect natural
selection to favour those monkeys that do not give alarm calls over
those that do. But this raises an immediate puzzle. How did the
alarm-calling behaviour evolve in the first place, and why has it not
been eliminated by natural selection? How can the existence of altruism
be reconciled with basic Darwinian principles?

Ambiguity,0.7755375504493713,0.6923298835754395,"

Fun fact: the word ‘ambiguous’, at least according to the
Oxford English Dictionary, is ambiguous between two main types of
meaning: uncertainty or dubiousness on the one hand and a sign bearing
multiple meanings on the other. I mention this merely to disambiguate
what this entry is about, which concerns a word or phrase enjoying
multiple meanings. In this sense, ambiguity has been the source of
much frustration, bemusement, and amusement for philosophers,
lexicographers, linguists, cognitive scientists, literary theorists
and critics, authors, poets, orators and just about everyone who
considers the interpretation(s) of linguistic signs.

Philosophers’ interest in ambiguity has largely stemmed from
concerns regarding the regimentation of natural language in formal
logic: arguments that may look good in virtue of their linguistic form
in fact can go very wrong if the words or phrases involved are
equivocal. It would be logical folly, for example, to conclude from
the true (on one reading) sentences ‘All bachelors are
necessarily unmarried’ and ‘Adam was a bachelor’
that Adam was necessarily unmarried. In other words, philosophers have
often found ambiguity the sort of thing one needs to avoid and
eradicate when they do their serious philosophical business. Frege
worried about the phenomenon enough to counsel against allowing any
multiplicities of sense in a perfect language. Authors, poets,
lyricists and the like, on the other hand, have often found ambiguity
to be an extremely powerful tool. Thomas Pynchon’s sentence
“we have forests full of game and hundreds of beaters who drive
the animals toward the hunters such as myself who are waiting to shoot
them,” (Against the Day, p. 46) utilizes the referential
ambiguity of ‘them’ to great effect when said by his
fictionalized Archduke Ferdinand. Shakespeare’s “Ask for
me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man” (Romeo and
Juliet, Act III, Scene 1 line 97–98) plays cleverly on the
double meaning of ‘grave’. Comedians have often found
ambiguity useful in the misdirection essential to some forms of
comedy. Groucho Marx’s “I shot an elephant in my
pajamas” is a classic of this genre.

Ambiguity is important and it is worth examining what the phenomenon
is and how it differs and relates to similar phenomena such as
indexicality, polysemy, vagueness, and especially sense generality.
While ‘is an uncle’ can be satisfied by both brothers of
mothers and brothers of fathers, the phrase is not ambiguous but
unspecified with respect to parent. The article will focus on what the
phenomenon is and isn’t and deal with some of the interesting
factors that confound the easy detection and categorization of
apparent ambiguities.

Ammonius,0.6355912685394287,0.0845741406083107,"

Ammonius (ca. 435/445–517/526) taught philosophy at Alexandria,
where his father Hermeias had taught earlier. Known primarily for his
commentaries on Aristotle, which were said to be of greater benefit
than anyone else’s, he was also distinguished in geometry and
astronomy. Himself a pupil of Proclus at Athens, at Alexandria
Ammonius taught most of the important Platonists of the late
5th and early 6th centuries: Asclepius,
Damascius and Simplicius, Eutocius, and Olympiodorus; Elias and David
are considered indirect pupils of his. Damascius, who went on to head
the school at Athens, heard Ammonius lecture, but attached himself
rather to the mentorship of Isidore and followed him to Athens. While
almost all of Ammonius’ Aristotle commentaries were published by
students from his lectures, the large commentary on De
Interpretatione was written up by Ammonius himself for
publication. These commentaries are largely dependent on the lectures
of Proclus and, to a lesser extent, Syrianus and thus indebted to
their style of Iamblichean Neoplatonism. Ammonius is known for several
contributions, especially for the introduction of an Alexandrian
tradition of commentary on Aristotle, but also for the first preserved
version of the set of questions to be answered preliminary to the
study of Aristotle, the thesis that for Aristotle God is the efficient
as well as final cause of the world, and the treatment of the sea
battle of De Interpretatione 9 as one of three determinist
arguments, along with the ‘Reaper’ and the argument from
divine foreknowledge.

Plotinus,0.5957796573638916,0.18488408625125885,"


Plotinus (204/5 – 270 C.E.), is generally regarded as the
founder of Neoplatonism. He is one of the most influential
philosophers in antiquity after Plato and Aristotle.  The term
‘Neoplatonism’ is an invention of early 19th
century European scholarship and indicates the penchant of historians
for dividing ‘periods’ in history.  In this case, the term
was intended to indicate that Plotinus initiated a new phase in the
development of the Platonic tradition.  What this
‘newness’ amounted to, if anything, is controversial,
largely because one’s assessment of it depends upon one’s
assessment of what Platonism is.  In fact, Plotinus (like all his
successors) regarded himself simply as a Platonist, that is, as an
expositor and defender of the philosophical position whose greatest
exponent was Plato himself.  Originality was thus not held as a
premium by Plotinus.  Nevertheless, Plotinus realized that Plato
needed to be interpreted.  In addition, between Plato and himself,
Plotinus found roughly 600 years of philosophical writing, much of it
reflecting engagement with Plato and the tradition of philosophy he
initiated.  Consequently, there were at least two avenues for
originality open to Plotinus, even if it was not his intention to say
fundamentally new things.  The first was in trying to say what Plato
meant on the basis of what he wrote or said or what others reported
him to have said.  This was the task of exploring the philosophical
position that we happen to call ‘Platonism’.  The second
was in defending Plato against those who, Plotinus thought, had
misunderstood him and therefore unfairly criticized him.  Plotinus
found himself, especially as a teacher, taking up these two avenues.
His originality must be sought for by following his path.

Medieval Theories of Analogy,0.7396160364151001,0.2669033408164978,"


Medieval theories of analogy were a response to problems in three
areas: logic, theology, and metaphysics. Logicians were concerned with
the use of words having more than one sense, whether completely
different, or related in some way. Theologians were concerned with
language about God. How can we speak about a transcendent, totally
simple spiritual being without altering the sense of the words we use?
Metaphysicians were concerned with talk about reality. How can we say
that both substances (e.g., Socrates) and accidents (e.g., the
beardedness of Socrates) exist when one is dependent on the other; how
can we say that both God and creatures exist, when one is created by
the other? Medieval thinkers reacted to these three problems by
developing a theory which divided words into three sorts,
independently of context. Some were univocal (always used with the
same sense), some were purely equivocal (used with quite different
senses), and some were analogical (used with related
senses). Analogical terms were thought to be particularly useful in
metaphysics and theology, but they were routinely discussed in
commentaries on Aristotle’s logic and in logic textbooks. The
background to the discussion was given by what is often called the
analogy of being or metaphysical analogy, the doctrine that reality is
divided both horizontally into the very different realities of
substances and accidents and vertically into the very different
realities of God and creatures, and that these realities are
analogically related. Nonetheless, the phrase “medieval theories
of analogy” as used here will refer to semantic analogy, a set
of linguistic and logical doctrines supplemented, at least from the
fourteenth century on, by doctrines about the nature of human
concepts.



There were three main types of semantic analogy, each based on a type
of metaphysical analogy. In the original Greek sense, analogy involved
a comparison of two proportions or relations. Thus
‘principle’ was said to be an analogical term when said of
a point and a spring of water because a point is related to a line as
a spring is related to a river. This type of analogy came to be called
the analogy of proportionality. In the second sense, analogy involved
a relation between two things, of which one is primary and the other
secondary. Thus ‘healthy’ was said to be an analogical
term when said of a dog and its food because while the dog has health
in the primary sense, its food is healthy only secondarily as
contributing to or causing the health of the dog. This second type of
analogy became known as the analogy of attribution, and its special
mark was being said in a prior and a posterior sense (per prius et
posterius). A third type of analogy, sometimes used by
theologians, appealed to a relation of likeness between God and
creatures. Creatures are called good or just because their goodness or
justice imitates or reflects the goodness or justice of God. This type
of analogy was called the analogy of imitation or participation. Of
the three types, it is the analogy of attribution that is central to
medieval discussions.


From the fourteenth century on discussions of analogy focused not so
much on linguistic usages as on the nature of the concepts that
corresponded to the words used. Is there just one concept that
corresponds to an analogical term, or is there a sequence of concepts?
If the latter, how are the members of the sequence ordered and related
to each other? Moreover, how far should we distinguish between
so-called formal concepts (or acts of mind) and objective concepts
(whatever it is that is the object of the act of understanding)? These
discussions were still influential at the time of Descartes.

Analogy and Analogical Reasoning,0.7416864037513733,0.2717195451259613,"


An analogy is a comparison between two objects, or systems of
objects, that highlights respects in which they are thought to be
similar. Analogical reasoning is any type of
thinking that relies upon an analogy. An analogical
argument is an explicit representation of a form of
analogical reasoning that cites accepted similarities between two
systems to support the conclusion that some further similarity
exists. In general (but not always), such arguments belong in the
category of inductive reasoning, since their conclusions do not follow
with certainty but are only supported with varying degrees of
strength.  Here, ‘inductive reasoning’ is used in a broad
sense that includes all inferential processes that “expand
knowledge in the face of uncertainty” (Holland et al. 1986: 1),
including
 abductive inference.


Analogical reasoning is fundamental to human thought and, arguably,
to some nonhuman animals as well. Historically, analogical
reasoning has played an important, but sometimes mysterious, role in a
wide range of problem-solving contexts. The explicit use of
analogical arguments, since antiquity, has been a distinctive feature
of scientific, philosophical and legal reasoning. This article
focuses primarily on the nature, evaluation and justification of
analogical arguments. Related topics include
 metaphor,
 models in science,
and
 precedent and analogy in legal reasoning.

Analysis,0.8462218046188354,0.6546005606651306,"


Analysis has always been at the heart of philosophical method, but it
has been understood and practised in many different ways. Perhaps, in
its broadest sense, it might be defined as a process of isolating or 
working back to what is more fundamental by means of which something,
initially taken as given, can be explained or reconstructed. The 
explanation or reconstruction is often then exhibited in a 
corresponding process of synthesis. This allows great variation in 
specific method, however. The aim may be to get back to basics, but 
there may be all sorts of ways of doing this, each of which might be 
called ‘analysis’. The dominance of 
‘analytic’ philosophy in the English-speaking world, and 
increasingly now in the rest of the world, might suggest that a 
consensus has formed concerning the role and importance of analysis. 
This assumes, though, that there is agreement on what 
‘analysis’ means, and this is far from clear. On the 
other hand, Wittgenstein's later critique of analysis in the 
early (logical atomist) period of analytic philosophy, and 
Quine's attack on the analytic-synthetic distinction, for 
example, have led some to claim that we are now in a 
‘post-analytic’ age. Such criticisms, however, are only 
directed at particular conceptions of analysis. If we look at the 
history of philosophy, and even if we just look at the history of 
analytic philosophy, we find a rich and extensive repertoire of 
conceptions of analysis which philosophers have continually drawn 
upon and reconfigured in different ways. Analytic philosophy is alive
and well precisely because of the range of conceptions of analysis 
that it involves. It may have fragmented into various interlocking 
subtraditions, but those subtraditions are held together by both 
their shared history and their methodological interconnections. It is
the aim of this article to indicate something of the range of 
conceptions of analysis in the history of philosophy and their 
interconnections, and to provide a bibliographical resource for those
wishing to explore analytic methodologies and the philosophical 
issues that they raise.

The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction,0.8395270109176636,0.6491994261741638,"

An “analytic” sentence, such as “Ophthalmologists
are doctors,” has historically been characterized as one whose
truth depends upon the meanings of its constituent terms (and how
they’re combined) alone, as opposed to a more usual
“synthetic” sentence, such as “Ophthalmologists are
rich,” whose truth depends also upon the facts about the world
that the sentence represents, e.g., that ophthalmologists are rich.
This is sometimes called the “metaphysical”
characterization of the distinction, concerned with the source of the
truth of the sentences. A more cautious,
epistemological characterization is that analytic sentences
are those whose truth can be known merely by knowing the
meanings of the constituent terms, as opposed to having also to know
something about the represented world. Beginning with Frege, many
philosophers hoped to show that the truths of logic and mathematics
and other apparently a priori domains, such as much of
philosophy and the foundations of science, could be shown to be at
least epistemically analytic by careful “conceptual
analysis.” This project encountered a number of problems that
have seemed so intractable as to lead some philosophers, particularly
Quine, to doubt the reality of the distinction. Surprisingly, this led
him and others to doubt the reality and determinacy of psychological
states. There have been a number of interesting reactions to this
scepticism, both in philosophy and in linguistics, but, while the
reality of psychological states might be saved, it has yet to be shown
that appeals to the analytic will ever be able to ground the a
priori in the way that philosophers had hoped.

Anaphora,0.8188175559043884,0.8773972392082214,"

Anaphora is sometimes characterized as the phenomenon whereby the
interpretation of an occurrence of one expression depends on the
interpretation of an occurrence of another or whereby an occurrence of
an expression has its referent supplied by an occurrence of some other
expression in the same or another
 sentence.[1]
 However, these are at best very rough characterizations of the
phenomena, since things other than anaphoric expressions satisfy the
first characterization and many cases of anaphora fail to satisfy the
second. For example, in some sense of “interpretation”,
the interpretation of the expression “bank” in the
following sentence depends on the interpretation of other expressions
(in particular, “of the river”):

(1) John is
down by the bank of the river.


But no one would say this is an example of anaphora. And as to the
second characterization, though all agree that the following is an
example of anaphora (and “he” is an anaphoric pronoun here
on one reading of the sentence), it is not a case of the
referent of one expression being supplied by another
expression, (since “he” is not a referring expression on
the reading in question):

(2) Every male
lawyer believes he is smart.


Hence, rather than attempting to characterize anaphora generally and
abstractly, we shall begin with some examples. There is generally
thought to be many types of anaphora, though in some cases there is
disagreement as to whether to classify those cases as anaphora or
 not.[2]


Pronominal anaphora:

(3) John left.
He said he was ill. (The antecedent is “John” and the
anaphoric expression is “he”.)


VP anaphora (also called VP ellipsis):

(4) Mary Anne
took out the garbage. Claudia did too. (The antecedent is “took
out the garbage” and the anaphoric expression a null VP. See
Partee and Bach (1984), Prüst et al. (1994).)


Propositional anaphora:

(5) One
plaintiff was passed over for promotion three times. But the jury
didn’t believe this. (The antecedent is the proposition
expressed by the first sentence. The anaphoric expression is
“this”. Example from Asher and Lascarides
(2003).)


Adjectival anaphora:

(6) A kind
stranger returned my wallet. Such people are rare. (The antecedent is
“kind stranger” and the anaphoric expression
“such”.)


Modal anaphora:

(7) John might
give a presentation. He would use slides. (The antecedent is the
possibility described by the first sentence, and the anaphoric
expression is the modal “would”. Example from Stone and
Hardt 1999)


Temporal anaphora:

(8) Sheila had
a party last Friday and Sam got drunk. (The time at which Sam got
drunk is anaphoric on the time at which Sheila had the party. Example
from Partee 1984.)


Kind-level anaphora:

(9) John gave
a presentation. Sarah gave one too. (The antecedent is “a
presentation”, and the anaphoric expression is
“one”.)


The antecedent also does not always have to precede the anaphoric
expression; when it doesn’t, these are called cases of
cataphora or backwards anaphora:

(10) If she
doesn’t show up soon, Jane will be disqualified from the
competition.


Despite there being many kinds of anaphora, this article will focus on
pronominal anaphora, since this is the type of anaphora that has
received the most attention in the linguistics and (especially)
philosophical literature. Some anaphoric pronouns are referring
expressions that inherit their referents from other referring
expressions. For example, on the anaphoric reading of
 (3),
 “He” inherits its referent from “John”, which
is said to be the antecedent of the pronoun. Such anaphora is
simple and well understood. In cases such as
 (2)
 above, the anaphoric pronoun has as its antecedent a quantifier
(“Every male lawyer” in (2)), and essentially functions as
a variable bound by the quantifier. Again, such cases are well
understood. There are some anaphoric pronouns that cannot be
understood as referring expressions that inherit their referents from
other referring expressions, nor as variables bound by quantified
antecedents. These cases of anaphora are of interest to philosophers
and linguists because formulating proper semantic theories for them
has proved to be a difficult and interesting task. Many theories of
these cases are currently being advocated.

Anarchism is a political theory, which is skeptical of the
justification of authority and power, especially political power.
Anarchism is usually grounded in moral claims about the importance of
individual liberty. Anarchists also offer a positive theory of human
flourishing, based upon an ideal of non-coercive consensus building.
Anarchism has inspired practical efforts at establishing utopian
communities, radical and revolutionary political agendas, and various
forms of direct action. This entry primarily describes
“philosophical anarchism”: it focuses on anarchism as a
theoretical idea and not as a form of political activism. While
philosophical anarchism describes a skeptical theory of political
legitimation, anarchism is also a concept that has been employed in
philosophical and literary theory to describe a sort of
anti-foundationalism. Philosophical anarchism can mean either a theory
of political life that is skeptical of attempts to justify state

Anaxagoras,0.6637557148933411,0.029685068875551224,"


Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (a major Greek city of Ionian Asia Minor), a
Greek philosopher of the 5th century B.C.E. (born ca.
500–480), was the first of the Presocratic philosophers to live in
Athens. He propounded a physical theory of
“everything-in-everything,” and claimed that
nous (intellect or mind) was the motive cause of the
cosmos. He was the first to give a correct explanation of eclipses,
and was both famous and notorious for his scientific theories,
including the claims that the sun is a mass of red-hot metal, that the
moon is earthy, and that the stars are fiery stones. Anaxagoras
maintained that the original state of the cosmos was a mixture of all
its ingredients (the basic realities of his system). The ingredients
are thoroughly mixed, so that no individual ingredient as such is
evident, but the mixture is not entirely uniform or
homogeneous. Although every ingredient is ubiquitous, some ingredients
are present in higher concentrations than others, and these
proportions may also vary from place to place (even if they do not do
so in the original state of the cosmos). The mixture is unlimited in
extent, and at some point in time it is set into motion by the action
of nous (intellect).  The mixture begins to rotate around some
small point within it, and as the whirling motion proceeds and expands
through the mass, the ingredients in the mixture are shifted and separated
out (in terms of relative density) and remixed with each other,
ultimately producing the cosmos of apparently separate material masses and
material objects, with differential properties, that we perceive.

Pyrrho,0.5706384778022766,0.29044151306152344,"


Pyrrho was the starting-point for a philosophical movement known as
Pyrrhonism that flourished several centuries after his own time. This
later Pyrrhonism was one of the two major traditions of sceptical
thought in the Greco-Roman world (the other being located in Plato's
Academy during much of the Hellenistic period). Perhaps the central
question about Pyrrho is whether or to what extent he himself was a
sceptic in the later Pyrrhonist mold. The later Pyrrhonists claimed
inspiration from him; and, as we shall see, there is undeniably some
basis for this. But it does not follow that Pyrrho's philosophy was
identical to that of this later movement, or even that the later
Pyrrhonists thought that it was identical; the claims of indebtedness
that are expressed by or attributed to members of the later Pyrrhonist
tradition are broad and general in character (and in Sextus Empiricus'
case notably cautious—see Outlines of Pyrrhonism
1.7), and do not in themselves point to any particular reconstruction
of Pyrrho's thought. It is necessary, therefore, to focus on the
meager evidence bearing explicitly upon Pyrrho's own ideas and
attitudes. How we read this evidence will also, of course, affect our
conception of Pyrrho's relations with his philosophical contemporaries
and predecessors.

John Anderson,0.607366144657135,0.523901104927063,"
John Anderson (1893–1962) was a Scottish philosopher who worked
primarily in Australia. In 1927 he was appointed to the Challis Chair
of Philosophy at the University of Sydney and occupied this position
until his retirement in 1958. In relative isolation he developed a
distinctive realist philosophy which was inspirational for generations
of students at Sydney. While developing this position, he carried most
of the teaching load in philosophy at the university, wrote the
articles for which he is primarily known, and as contributor and
editor kept the Australasian Journal of Psychology and
Philosophy going. Shortly after his arrival in Sydney he acted as
theoretical advisor to the Communist Party of Australia, but moved
away from the party through the 1930s and finally adopted a strongly
anti-communist stance. He remained active throughout his career,
however, in a series of public controversies concerning censorship,
university reform, academic freedom and opposition to religious
instruction in education. Depending upon one’s perspective, these
activities diverted him from serious philosophical work or were the
natural expression of his philosophical outlook. On either view his
intellectual impact at Sydney was overwhelming. Philosophers such as
David Malet Armstrong, John Passmore, John Leslie Mackie, Eugene
Kamenka, Jim Baker and David Stove all acknowledged Anderson’s formative
influence. From his early teaching at Edinburgh, Anderson influenced the social and political thought of Rush Rhees, and so also indirectly that of Alasdair Macintyre who came to recognise
and value common themes in his own sociological and historical view of
ethics. Outside the academy, Anderson’s criticisms of conventional
morality and his account of positive ethical goods promoting a stance of
commitment, endeavour, risk and critical opposition to merely customary
expectations was a powerful tonic for a small but influential group of
anti-careerist intellectuals, lawyers, journalists and artists
collectively known as the “Sydney Push”.

Commentators on Aristotle,0.6473771333694458,0.1108616068959236,"

One important mode of philosophical expression from the end of the
Hellenistic period and into Late Antiquity was the philosophical
commentary. During this time Plato and Aristotle were regarded as
philosophical authorities and their works were subject to intense
study. This entry offers a concise account of how the revival of
interest in the philosophy of Aristotle that took place toward the
end of the Hellenistic period eventually developed into a new literary
production: the philosophical commentary. It also follows the
commentary tradition into Late Antiquity in order to account for the
vitality and richness of this tradition. Special emphasis is given to
the ancient study of the Categories because this short but
difficult treatise played a central role in the Post-Hellenistic
return to Aristotle. The reader should keep in mind that the study of
Aristotle in the form of the commentary did not mean the cessation of
genuine philosophical thought. Quite the contrary: philosophers
customarily used the commentary format not only to expound the works
of Aristotle, but also as a vehicle for original philosophical
theorizing. One consequence of this approach was that, at least at the
beginning, the return to Aristotle did not involve the acceptance of
any definite set of doctrines. More directly (and more boldly), there
was no definite set of doctrines that a Peripatetic philosopher in the
1st century BCE was expected to accept. At the time
Aristotle was considered an authority not because he was above
criticism, but because he deserved to be studied carefully.

Questions about animal consciousness — in particular, which
animals have consciousness and what (if anything) that consciousness
might be like — are  both  scientific and
philosophical. They are scientific because answering them will require
gathering information using scientific techniques — no amount of
arm-chair pondering, conceptual analysis, logic, a priori
theory-building, transcendental inference or introspection will tell
us whether a platypus, an iguana, or a squid (to take a few examples)
enjoy a life of subjective experience — at some point we'll have
to learn something about the animals. Just what sort(s) of science can
bear on these questions is a live question, but at the least this will
include investigations of the behavior and neurophysiology of a wide
taxonomic range of animals, as well as the phylogenetic relationships
among taxa. But these questions are deeply philosophical as well, with
epistemological, metaphysical, and phenomenological
dimensions. Progress will therefore ultimately require
interdisciplinary work by philosophers willing to engage with the
empirical details of animal biology, as well as scientists who are
sensitive to the philosophical complexities of the issue.

The Moral Status of Animals,0.522621214389801,0.718567967414856,"

Is there something distinctive about humanity that justifies the idea
that humans have moral status while non-humans do not? Providing an
answer to this question has become increasingly important among
philosophers as well as those outside of philosophy who are interested
in our treatment of non-human animals. For some, answering this
question will enable us to better understand the nature of human
beings and the proper scope of our moral obligations. Some argue that
there is an answer that can distinguish humans from the rest of the
natural world. Many of those who accept this answer are interested in
justifying certain human practices towards non-humans—practices
that cause pain, discomfort, suffering and death. This latter group
expects that in answering the question in a particular way, humans
will be justified in granting moral consideration to other humans that
is neither required nor justified when considering non-human animals.
In contrast to this view, an increasing number of philosophers have
argued that while humans are different in a variety of ways from each
other and other animals, these differences do not provide a
philosophical defense for denying non-human animals moral
consideration. What the basis of moral consideration is and what it
amounts to has been the source of much disagreement.

Anomalous Monism,0.7924174070358276,0.4810989797115326,"


Anomalous Monism is a theory about the scientific status of
psychology, the physical status of mental events, and the relation
between these issues developed by Donald Davidson. It claims that
psychology cannot be a science like basic physics, in that it cannot in
principle yield exceptionless laws for predicting or explaining human
thoughts and actions (mental anomalism). It also holds that thoughts
and actions must be physical (monism, or token-identity). Thus,
according to Anomalous Monism, psychology cannot be reduced to physics,
but must nonetheless share a physical ontology.


While neither of these claims, on its own, is novel, their relation,
according to Anomalous Monism, is. It is precisely because
there can be no such strict laws governing mental events that those
events must be identical to physical events. Previous identity
theories of mind had held that claims concerning the identity of
particular mental and physical events (tokens) depended upon the
discovery of lawlike relations between mental and physical properties
(types). Empirical evidence for psychophysical laws was thus held to be
required for particular token-identity claims. Token-identity claims
thus depended upon type-identity. Davidson's position is dramatically
different—it requires no empirical evidence and
depends on there being no lawlike relations between mental and
physical properties. It in effect justifies the token-identity of
mental and physical events through arguing for the impossibility of
type-identities between mental and physical properties. (For
discussion of philosophical positions related to Anomalous Monism, see
the supplement on 
 Related Views.)

The appeal of Anomalous Monism is due to these enigmatic features, a
fairly straightforward argumentative structure, and its attempt to
bring together an intuitively acceptable metaphysics (monism) with a
sophisticated understanding of the relation between psychological and
physical explanatory schemes (anomalism). Its explicit assumptions are
each intended, on their own, to be acceptable to positions opposing
monism, but, when taken together, to show that monism is in fact
required.

Moral Anti-Realism,0.5483596324920654,0.664943516254425,"


It might be expected that it would suffice for the entry for
“moral anti-realism” to contain only some links to other
entries in this encyclopedia. It could contain a link to “moral
realism” and stipulate the negation of the view there
described. Alternatively, it could have links to the entries
“anti-realism” and “morality” and could
stipulate the conjunction of the materials contained therein. The fact
that neither of these approaches would be adequate—and, more
strikingly, that following the two procedures would yield
substantively non-equivalent results—reveals the contentious and
unsettled nature of the topic.


“Anti-realism,” “non-realism,” and
“irrealism” may for most purposes be treated as
synonymous. Occasionally, distinctions have been suggested for local
pedagogic reasons (see, e.g., Wright 1988a; Dreier 2004), but
no such distinction has generally taken
hold. (“Quasi-realism” denotes something very different,
to be discussed in the supplement
 Projectivism and quasi-realism
below.) All three terms are to be defined in opposition to realism,
but since there is no consensus on how “realism” is to be
understood, “anti-realism” fares no better. Crispin Wright
(1992: 1) comments that “if there ever was a consensus of
understanding about ‘realism’, as a philosophical term of
art, it has undoubtedly been fragmented by the pressures exerted by
the various debates—so much so that a philosopher who asserts
that she is a realist about theoretical science, for example, or
ethics, has probably, for most philosophical audiences, accomplished
little more than to clear her throat.” This entry doesn't purport to do
justice to the intricacy and subtlety of the topic of realism; it
should be acknowledged at the outset that the fragmentation of which
Wright speaks
renders it unlikely that the label “moral anti-realism”
even succeeds in picking out a definite position. Yet perhaps we can
at least make an advance on clearing our throats.

 A priori justification is a type of epistemic
justification that is, in some sense, independent of
experience. Gettier examples have led most philosophers to think that
having a justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge
 (see sec. 5, below, and the
example, Sheep), but many still believe that it is
necessary. For those that do, a priori knowledge is knowledge
based on a priori justification. There are a variety of views
about whether a priori justification can be defeated
(overridden or undercut) by other evidence, especially empirical
evidence, and a variety of views about whether a priori
justification, and knowledge, must be only of necessary or analytic
propositions (see examples (1a)–(4a) and (7a)–(14a),
below), or at least of ones believed to be necessary or analytic.
 A priori justification seems to rest on rational
intuitions, or insights, but there are a variety of views about the
nature of these intuitions or insights. There are different
explanations of how these intuitions provide justification, if they
do. Some philosophers do not see a priori justification as
resting on any evidence, either experiential or nonexperiential, and
so not resting on rational intuitions or insights at all. Their idea
is that in some circumstances it can be default reasonable for a
person to accept a proposition, or that the person is entitled to
accept certain presuppositions independent of any evidence. Of course,
there are also many objections to the idea that there can be a
priori justification. Finally, rationalists think that there can
be a priori justification and knowledge of the world while
empiricists deny this.


Because most philosophers believe that knowledge requires
justification, it is widely thought that a priori knowledge
is just a special kind of knowledge, namely, knowledge that is based
solely on a priori justification. That makes the notion of
a priori justification central, and that is why I will focus
this discussion on that notion. I will make only a few remarks about
a priori knowledge at the end of this essay. The following
list indicates the topics that will be presented and addressed.

Laws of nature take center stage in philosophy of science.  Laws are
usually believed to stand in a tight conceptual relation to many
important key concepts such as causation, explanation, confirmation,
determinism, counterfactuals etc. Traditionally, philosophers of
science have focused on physical laws, which were taken to be at least
true, universal statements that support counterfactual claims. But,
although this claim about laws might be true with respect to physics,
laws in the special sciences (such as biology, psychology, economics
etc.) appear to have—maybe not surprisingly—different
features than the laws of physics. Special science laws—for
instance, the economic law “Under the condition of perfect
competition, an increase of demand of a commodity leads to an increase
of price, given that the quantity of the supplied commodity remains
constant” and, in biology, Mendel's Laws—are usually taken
to “have exceptions”, to be “non-universal” or
“to be ceteris paribus laws”. How and whether the
laws of physics and the laws of the special sciences differ is one of
the crucial questions motivating the debate on ceteris
paribus laws. Another major, controversial question concerns the
determination of the precise meaning of “ceteris
paribus”. Philosophers have attempted to explicate the meaning
of ceteris paribus clauses in different ways.  The question of meaning
is connected to the problem of empirical content, i.e., the question
whether ceteris paribus laws have non-trivial and empirically testable
content. Since many philosophers have argued that ceteris paribus laws
lack empirically testable content, this problem constitutes a major
challenge to a theory of ceteris paribus laws.

Epistêmê is the Greek word most often translated
as knowledge, while technê is translated as either
craft or art. These translations, however, may inappropriately harbor
some of our contemporary assumptions about the relation between theory
(the domain of ‘knowledge’) and practice (the concern of
‘craft’ or ‘art’). Outside of modern science,
there is sometimes skepticism about the relevance of theory to
practice because it is thought that theory is conducted at so great a
remove from the facts, the province of practice, that it can lose touch
with them. Indeed, at the level of practice, concrete experience might
be all we need. And within science, theory strives for a value-free
view of reality. As a consequence, scientific theory cannot tell us
how things should be — the realm of ‘art’ or
‘craft’ . So we must turn elsewhere for answers to the
profound, but still practical, questions about how we should live our
lives. However, some of the features of this contemporary distinction
between theory and practice are not found in the relation between
epistêmê and technê. As we move
chronologically from Xenophon to Plotinus, we go from an author who
does not distinguish between the two terms, to an author who has
little use for technê because it is so far from
reality. It is in Aristotle that we find the basis for something like
the modern opposition between epistêmê as pure
theory and technê as practice. Yet even Aristotle
refers to technê or craft as itself also
epistêmê or knowledge because it is a practice
grounded in an ‘account’ — something involving
theoretical understanding. Plato — whose theory of forms seems an
arch example of pure theoretical knowledge — nevertheless is
fascinated by the idea of a kind of technê that is
informed by knowledge of forms.  In the Republic this
knowledge is the indispensable basis for the philosophers' craft of
ruling in the city. Picking up another theme in Plato's dialogues, the
Stoics develop the idea that virtue is a kind of technê
or craft of life, one that is based on an understanding of the
universe. The relation, then, between epistêmê
and technê in ancient philosophy offers an interesting
contrast with our own notions about theory (pure knowledge) and
(experience-based) practice. There is an intimate positive
relationship between epistêmê and
technê, as well as a fundamental contrast.

No work of science has drawn more attention from philosophers than
Newton's Principia. The reasons for this, however,
and consequently the focus of the attention have changed significantly
from one century to the next. During the 20th Century
philosophers have viewed the Principia in the context of
Einstein's new theory of gravity in his theory of general
relativity. The main issues have concerned the relation between
Newton's and Einstein's theories of gravity and what the
need to replace the former with the latter says about the nature,
scope, and limits of scientific knowledge. During most of the
18th Century, by contrast, Newton's theory of gravity
remained under dispute, especially because of the absence of a
mechanism — in particular, a contact mechanism — producing
gravitational forces. The philosophic literature correspondingly
endeavored to clarify and to resolve, one way or the other, the dispute
over whether the Principia should or should not be viewed as
methodologically well founded. By the 1790s Newton's theory
of gravity had become established among those engaged in research in
orbital mechanics and physical geodesy, leading to the
Principia becoming the exemplar of science at its
most successful. Philosophic interest in the Principia
during the 19th Century therefore came to focus on how
Newton had achieved this success, in part to characterize the knowledge
that had been achieved and in part to pursue comparable knowledge in
other areas of research. Unfortunately, a very large fraction of
the philosophic literature in all three centuries has suffered from a
quite simplistic picture of the Principia itself. The
main goal of this entry is to replace that simplistic picture with one
that does more justice to the richness of both the content and the
methodology of the Principia.

The formal topic of the Cratylus is ‘correctness of
names’, a hot topic in the late fifth century BC when the
dialogue has its dramatic setting. Sophists like Prodicus offered
training courses in this subject, sometimes perhaps meaning by it
little more than lessons in correct diction. But that practical issue
spawned the theoretical question, what criteria determine the correct
choice of name for any given object? And in the Cratylus
Socrates’ two primary interlocutors, Hermogenes and Cratylus
(the latter of whom is reported by Aristotle to have been an early
philosophical influence on Plato), represent two diametrically opposed
answers to that question.


As a preliminary, it is important to be clear about what is meant by
‘names’. The plural noun onomata (singular
onoma), translated ‘names’, in fact varies
between being (a) a general term for ‘words’, (b) more
narrowly, nouns, or perhaps nouns and adjectives, and (c) in certain
contexts, proper names alone. In (a), the most generic use, it comes
to designate language as such. Ultimately, for this reason, the
Cratylus is Plato’s dialogue about language, even if
the elements of language on which it concentrates are in fact mainly
nouns. Proper names are included among these nouns, and at times are
treated as paradigmatic examples of them.


The positions of Hermogenes and Cratylus have come to be known to
modern scholarship as ‘conventionalism’ and
‘naturalism’ respectively. An extreme linguistic
conventionalist like Hermogenes holds that nothing but local
or national convention determines which words are used to designate
which objects. The same names could have been attached to quite
different objects, and the same objects given quite different names, so
long as the users of the language were party to the convention.
Cratylus, as an extreme linguistic naturalist, holds that names cannot
be arbitrarily chosen in the way that conventionalism describes or
advocates, because names belong naturally to their specific
objects. If you try to speak of something with any name other than its
natural name, you are simply failing to refer to it at all. For
example, he has told Hermogenes to the latter’s intense annoyance,
Hermogenes is not actually his name.


Socrates is the main speaker in this dialogue, and his arguments are
generally taken to represent Plato’s own current views. He starts
out by criticizing conventionalism, and persuades Hermogenes that some
kind of naturalism must be endorsed. This leads to a long central
section in which Socrates’ version of naturalism is spelt out by
appeal to proposed etymologies of philosophically important words:
those words, it turns out, have not been attached in a merely arbitrary
way to their objects, but are encoded descriptions of them. So
far the argument seems to be going Cratylus’ way. But in the
final part of the dialogue Socrates turns to Cratylus and shows him
that his expectations as a naturalist are set impossibly high: names
cannot aspire to being perfect encapsulations of their objects’
essences, and some  element of convention is must be conceded.


Scholarly opinion has long been divided as to how Socrates’
own eventual position should be understood — as a qualified
vindication of conventionalism, of naturalism, or of neither. If
Socrates is read as actually dismissing naturalism, it is almost
inevitable that his naturalistic etymological decodings of words, to
which well over half the dialogue is devoted, should be taken as not
seriously intended, and in fact as making fun of the entire
etymological practice. This has been the majority position among
interpreters for well over a century. It rests partly on the conviction
that (a) the etymologies are ridiculous, and (b) Plato knew as well as
we do that they are ridiculous.


However,  at least some caution is required here. The Greeks knew
little about the historical origins of their  own language, and
the style of etymology practised by Socrates in this dialogue is not
very different — except perhaps in its elaborateness —
from that practised by a great many ancient writers, one which had its
roots in Homer and Hesiod. None of Plato’s readers in antiquity,
starting with his own pupil Aristotle, seems to have suspected the
Cratylus etymologies of being non-serious. The interpretation
according to which Plato is mocking etymological practice, although
not demonstrably wrong, may be suspected of crediting him with an
anachronistic degree of insight into historical linguistics. That
Socrates’ long etymological extravaganza is peppered with humour is
not in doubt, but that the humour must be directed at the etymologies
as such is less clear. Reading Socratic humour is a largely intuitive
matter, and one which regularly divides readers.  Socrates’ humour in
the Cratylus is at least partly directed at his own
uncharacteristic boldness in declaiming long strings of word
derivations, contrary to his familiar disavowal of expert knowledge
about anything. Whether some of it is left over for deflating the
etymological enterprise itself is a question on which readers must
make up their own minds. But the present article is based on the
contrary assumption, that the etymological practice on display in the
dialogue is seriously meant.


Where does the Cratylus belong among Plato’s works?
It is conventional, though far from uncontroversial, to place an entire
series of dialogues featuring the ‘classical theory of
Forms’ in his middle period (see the entry on 
  Plato’s middle period metaphysics and epistemology).
  And three of these — the Republic, Phaedrus
and Parmenides — are often thought to belong late in
that period, on the evidence of stylistic features. For those who
accept this schema, the Cratylus ought to belong relatively
early in the group, since it contains the classical theory of Forms
but lacks the late stylistic features. It might therefore, with some
plausibility, be placed close to the Phaedo, and this dating
has often been favoured. However, thematic links to the interests
explored in late dialogues like the Sophist have encouraged
some to date it later. Besides the manuscripts preserve two passages
that seem to be traces of a superseded first edition of the dialogue,
suggesting that what we have could be a revised edition, quite
possibly of relatively late date. If so, the text as we have it may
not straightforwardly represent any one period of Plato’s work.

Plato’s Republic centers on a simple question: is it always
better to be just than unjust? The puzzles in Book One prepare for
this question, and Glaucon and Adeimantus make it explicit at the
beginning of Book Two. To answer the question, Socrates takes a long
way around, sketching an account of a good city on the grounds that a
good city would be just and that defining justice as a virtue of a
city would help to define justice as a virtue of a human being.
Socrates is finally close to answering the question after he
characterizes justice as a personal virtue at the end of Book Four,
but he is interrupted and challenged to defend some of the more
controversial features of the good city he has sketched. In Books Five
through Seven, he addresses this challenge, arguing (in effect) that
the just city and the just human being as he has sketched them are in
fact good and are in principle possible. After this long digression,
Socrates in Books Eight and Nine finally delivers three
“proofs” that it is always better to be just than
unjust. Then, because Socrates wants not only to show that it is
always better to be just but also to convince Glaucon and Adeimantus
of this point, and because Socrates’ proofs are opposed by the
teachings of poets, he bolsters his case in Book Ten by indicting the
poets’ claims to represent the truth and by offering a new myth that
is consonant with his proofs.


As this overview makes clear, the center of Plato’s Republic
is a contribution to ethics: a discussion of what the virtue justice 
is and why a person should be just. Yet because Socrates links his 
discussion of personal justice to an account of justice in the city 
and makes claims about how good and bad cities are arranged, the 
Republic sustains reflections on political questions, as 
well. Not that ethics and politics exhaust the concerns of the 
Republic. The account in Books Five through Seven of how a 
just city and a just person are in principle possible is an account 
of how knowledge can rule, which includes discussion of what 
knowledge and its objects are. Moreover, the indictment of the poets 
involves a wide-ranging discussion of art. This article, however, 
focuses on the ethics and politics of Plato’s Republic. For 
more on what the Republic says about knowledge and its 
objects, see 
 Plato: middle period metaphysics and epistemology,
 and for more about the discussion of the poets, see

This article attempts to provide a constructive guide to the main 
issues of ethics and politics in the Republic. Two 
assumptions shape its organization. First, it assumes that an account
of ethics and politics in the Republic requires a 
preliminary understanding of the question Socrates is facing and the 
strategy Socrates uses to answer the question. Second, it assumes 
that politics in the Republic is based upon the moral 
psychology in the Republic, and thus that the former is more
profitably discussed after the latter. With these assumptions in 
place, the following outline unfolds:

The Sophist and Statesman are late Platonic 
dialogues, whose relative dates are established by their stylistic 
similarity to the Laws, a work that was apparently still 
“on the wax” at the time of Plato's death (Diogenes 
Laertius 3.37). These dialogues are important in exhibiting Plato's
views on method and metaphysics after he criticized his own most 
famous contribution to the history of philosophy, the theory of 
separate, immaterial forms in the Parmenides. The 
Statesman also offers a transitional statement of Plato's 
political philosophy between the Republic and the 
Laws. The Sophist and Statesman show the 
author's increasing interest in mundane and practical knowledge. In 
this respect they seem more down-to-earth and Aristotelian in tone 
than dialogues dated to Plato's middle period such as the 
Phaedo and the Republic. This entry will focus on

The Parmenides is, quite possibly, the most enigmatic of
Plato's dialogues. The dialogue recounts an almost certainly
fictitious conversation between a venerable Parmenides (the Eleatic
Monist) and a youthful Socrates, followed by a dizzying array of
interconnected arguments presented by Parmenides to a young and
compliant interlocutor named “Aristotle” (not the
philosopher, but rather a man who became one of the Thirty Tyrants
after Athens' surrender to Sparta at the conclusion of the
Peloponnesian War). Most commentators agree that Socrates articulates
a version of the theory of forms defended by his much older namesake
in the dialogues of Plato's middle period, that Parmenides
mounts a number of potentially devastating challenges to this theory,
and that these challenges are followed by a piece of intellectual
“gymnastics” consisting of eight strings of arguments
(Deductions) that are in some way designed to help us see how to
protect the theory of forms against the challenges. Beyond this, there
is precious little scholarly consensus. Commentators disagree about
the proper way to reconstruct Parmenides' challenges, about the
overall logical structure of the Deductions, about the main subject of
the Deductions, about the function of the Deductions in relation to
the challenges, and about the final philosophical moral of the
dialogue as a whole.


The Parmenides inspired the metaphysical and mystical
theories of the later Neoplatonists (notably Plotinus and later,
Proclus), who saw in the Deductions the key to the hierarchical
ontological structure of the universe.

In the Timaeus Plato presents an elaborately wrought account
of the formation of the universe and an explanation of its impressive
order and beauty. The universe, he proposes, is the product of
rational, purposive, and beneficent agency. It is the handiwork of a
divine Craftsman (“Demiurge,” dêmiourgos,
28a6) who, imitating an unchanging and eternal model, imposes
mathematical order on a preexistent chaos to generate the ordered
universe (kosmos). The governing explanatory principle of the
account is teleological: the universe as a whole as well as its
various parts are so arranged as to produce a vast array of good
effects. For Plato this arrangement is not fortuitous, but the outcome
of the deliberate intent of Intellect (nous),
anthropomorphically represented by the figure of the Craftsman who
plans and constructs a world that is as excellent as its nature
permits it to be.

The beautiful orderliness of the universe is not only the
manifestation of Intellect; it is also the model for rational souls to
understand and to emulate. Such understanding and emulation restores
those souls to their original state of excellence, a state that was
lost in their embodiment. There is, then, an explicit ethical and
religious dimension to the discourse.

This picture of a divinely created universe, though controversial from
the start (see below, section 2), has captured the imagination and
admiration of numerous generations of philosophers and theologians
though the
 centuries.[1]
 Because of the vast scope of the work, as well as its character as a
monologue—by excluding exchanges between interlocutors the
discourse is much more like an authoritative statement than a set of
questions to be investigated—the Timaeus was generally
taken to be the culmination of its author’s intellectual
achievement, particularly by thinkers in sympathy with its portrayal
of the universe. This also seems to have been one of the reasons for
its early translation into Latin. Calcidius’ Latin translation
in the fourth century CE made it the only text of Plato available in
the Middle Ages in the Latin West until the twelfth century. While it
still was an important reference point for Kepler, its influence began
to wane over time. In the latter part of the nineteenth and earlier
part of the twentieth century interest in the Timaeus was
again stimulated by the refinement of philological methods and exact
historical
 scholarship,[2]
 but for most of the second half of the twentieth century the dialogue
was frequently dismissed as philosophically insignificant at best and
regressive at worst. It played an important role in debates about the
development of Plato’s philosophy, but not much more. Recent
decades, however, have witnessed a revival of interest in the
Timaeus: philosophers, historians of science and of ideas,
and philologists, while not necessarily persuaded by the
dialogue’s bold claims, have been fascinated by its majestic
account and have sympathetically entered into and sought to elucidate
its conceptual structure.

Principia Mathematica [PM] by A.N. Whitehead and Bertrand
Russell, published 1910–1913 in three volumes by Cambridge
University Press, contains a derivation of large portions of
mathematics using notions and principles of symbolic logic. The

development of logic during the 20th century, to the extent
that the beginner has trouble reading PM at all. This article provides
an introduction to the symbolism of PM, showing how that symbolism can
be translated into a more contemporary notation which should be
familiar to anyone who has had a first course in symbolic logic. This
translation is offered as an aid to learning the original notation,

contemporary symbolism. Learning the notation, then, is a first step

Epistemological Problems of Perception,0.7491216063499451,0.3899867236614227,"

The central problem in the epistemology of perception is that of
explaining how perception could give us knowledge or justified belief about an external
world, about things outside of ourselves. This problem has
traditionally been viewed in terms of a skeptical argument that
purports to show that such knowledge and justification are impossible. Skepticism about the
external world highlights a number of epistemological difficulties
regarding the nature and epistemic role of experience, and the
question of how perception might bring us into contact with a
mind-independent reality. The issues that arise are of central
importance for understanding knowledge and justification more
generally, even aside from their connection to skepticism.

Two main types of
response to the skeptical argument have traditionally been given: a
metaphysical response that focuses on the nature of the world,
perceptual experience, and/or the relation between them, in an effort
to show that perceptual knowledge is indeed possible; and a more
directly epistemological response that focuses on principles
specifying what is required for knowledge and/or justification, in an
effort to show that skepticism misstates the requirements for
knowledge.

Much of the philosophical tradition has viewed the central
epistemological problems concerning perception largely and sometimes
exclusively in terms of the metaphysical responses to
skepticism. For that reason, these will be addressed before moving on
to the more explicitly epistemological concerns.

Much of epistemology has arisen either in defense of, or in opposition
to, various forms of skepticism. Indeed, one could classify various
theories of knowledge by their responses to skepticism. For example,
rationalists could be viewed as skeptical about the possibility of
empirical knowledge while not being skeptical with regard to a priori
knowledge, and empiricists could be seen as skeptical about the
possibility of a priori knowledge but not so with regard to empirical
knowledge. In addition, views about many traditional philosophical
problems, e.g., the problem of other minds or the problem of
induction, can be seen as restricted forms of skepticism that
hold that we cannot have knowledge of any propositions in some
particular domain that is normally thought to be within our ken. 
This essay
will focus on the general forms of skepticism that question
our knowledge in many, if not all, domains in which we ordinarily
think knowledge is possible. Although this essay will consider some
aspects of the history of philosophical skepticism, the general forms
of skepticism to be discussed are those which contemporary
philosophers still find the most interesting.

Saint Thomas Aquinas,0.6243214011192322,0.2061134427785873,"


Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) lived at a critical juncture of 
western culture when the arrival of the Aristotelian corpus 
in Latin translation reopened the question of the relation between 
faith and reason, calling into question the modus vivendi 
that had obtained for centuries. This crisis flared up just as 
universities were being founded. Thomas, after early studies at 
Montecassino, moved on to the University of Naples, where he met 
members of the new Dominican Order. It was at Naples too that Thomas 
had his first extended contact with the new learning. When he joined 
the Dominican Order he went north to study with Albertus Magnus, 
author of a paraphrase of the Aristotelian corpus. Thomas 
completed his studies at the University of Paris, which had been 
formed out of the monastic schools on the Left Bank and the cathedral
school at Notre Dame. In two stints as a regent master Thomas 
defended the mendicant orders and, of greater historical importance, 
countered both the Averroistic interpretations of Aristotle and the 
Franciscan tendency to reject Greek philosophy. The result was a new 
modus vivendi between faith and philosophy which survived
until the rise of the new physics. The Catholic Church has over the
centuries regularly and consistently reaffirmed the central importance
of Thomas's work, both theological and philosophical, for
understanding its teachings concerning the Christian revelation, and
his close textual commentaries on Aristotle represent a cultural
resource which is now receiving increased recognition. The following
account concentrates on Thomas the philosopher.

"Aquinas' Moral, Political, and Legal Philosophy",0.5257174372673035,0.6002238988876343,"

For Thomas Aquinas, as for Aristotle, doing moral philosophy is
thinking as generally as possible about what I should choose to do
(and not to do), considering my whole life as a field of opportunity
(or misuse of opportunity). Thinking as general as this concerns not
merely my own opportunities, but the kinds of good things that any
human being can do and achieve, or be deprived of. Thinking about what
to do is conveniently labeled “practical”, and is
concerned with what and how to choose and do what one intelligently
and reasonably can (i) to achieve intelligible goods in one’s
own life and the lives of other human beings and their environment,
and (ii) to be of good character and live a life that as a whole will
have been a reasonable response to such opportunities.

Political philosophy is, in one respect, simply that part or extension
of moral philosophy which considers the kinds of choice that should be
made by all who share in the responsibility and authority of choosing
for a community of the comprehensive kind called political. In another
respect, it is a systematic explanatory account of the forms of
political arrangement that experience and empirical observation show
are available, with their characteristic features, outcomes, and
advantages (and disadvantages and bad aspects and consequences).
Though in form descriptive and contemplative, and thus non-practical,
this aspect of political philosophy remains subordinate, in its
systematization or conceptual structure, to the categories one finds
necessary or appropriate when doing moral and political philosophy as
it should be done, that is, as practical thinking by one whose every
choice (even the choice to do nothing now, or the choice do moral or
political philosophy) should be a good use of opportunity.

Moral and political philosophy for Aquinas, then, is (1) the set or
sets of concepts and propositions which, as principles and precepts of
action, pick out the kinds of chosen action that are truly intelligent
and reasonable for human individuals and political communities,
together with (2) the arguments necessary to justify those concepts
and propositions in the face of doubts, or at least to defend them
against objections. It is a fundamentally practical philosophy of
principles which direct us towards human fulfillment
so far as that happier state of affairs is both constituted and
achievable by way of the actions that both manifest and build up the
excellences of character traditionally called virtues. If one
must use a post-Kantian jargon, it is both “teleological”
and “deontic”, and not more the one than the other.

Arabic and Islamic Metaphysics,0.6098716259002686,0.15063445270061493,"

Among the philosophical disciplines transmitted to the Arabic and
Islamic world from the Greeks, metaphysics was of paramount
importance, as its pivotal role in the overall history of the
transmission of Greek thought into Arabic makes evident. The
beginnings of Arabic philosophy coincide with the production of the
first extensive translation of Aristotle’s Metaphysics,
within the circle of translators associated with the founder of Arabic
philosophy, al-Kindī. The so-called “early” or
“classical” phase of falsafa ends with the
largest commentary on the Metaphysics available in Western
philosophy, by Ibn Rushd (Averroes). The following
“golden” age of Arabic thought continues to be primarily
concerned with metaphysics, turning from the effort of interpreting
the intricacies of Aristotle’s canonical text towards the
process of assimilating the model of metaphysical science first
outlined by al-Fārābī and then implemented by Ibn
Sīnā (Avicenna).

In the incipit of the Metaphysics according to the
Arabic way of ordering the books of this work (book Alpha Elatton,
chapter 1), Arabic philosophers could even find the justification of
their Greek pedigree and their raison d’être in a
predominantly religious society: philosophy is said there to be
constitutively a “search” and to be directed towards a
goal—truth—that surpasses human individual capacities both
objectively, for its extremely wide scope, and subjectively, for the
weakness of man’s cognitive faculties, thus obliging its
followers to join their efforts with all previous and present
investigators of truth. This explains the large fortune of this
proemium, and of the similitude accompanying it (the human intellect,
with respect to the most knowable things, is like bats’ eyes
with respect to daylight), not only in philosophy, but also in
theology and literature, to such an extent that its different versions
can be taken as specimens of the various understandings of the nature
and possibilities of falsafa, and of the degree of its
dependence on Greek thought, in the history of Arabic-Islamic
philosophy.

This impression of centrality is confirmed by the large number and
great variety of works pertaining to metaphysics written in
Arabic—translations of the basic Greek texts, different kinds of
commentaries on the translated material, original works with various
degrees of comprehensiveness and doctrinal depth, etc.—all of
which provide clear evidence of the intellectual vivacity and the
productive energy of this philosophical area. Such an intensive
reflection on metaphysics leads to what represents the specific Arabic
contribution to the history of this discipline, namely the progressive
devising of a new standard of metaphysics, in which this discipline
assumes the form of a comprehensive and articulated synthesis of the
Greek heritage, undergoes a process of epistemological
refinement—in terms of definition of scope, coherence of
structure, rigorousness of arguments, etc.—and ascends to the
role of cornerstone of philosophy. This process brings forth a real
“second beginning” of metaphysics in the history of
philosophy, whose model eventually prevailed in philosophical circles,
despite occasional criticisms motivated by an anachronistic desire to
defend the Greek legacy in its uncontaminated form. Non-philosophical
forms of knowledge—above all revealed theology—also had to
confront the challenge posed by metaphysics. The vigorous and
long-lasting impact of this metaphysical paradigm in non-Arabic and
non-Muslim cultural areas, like the Latin-Christian and the
Hebrew-Jewish, attests to its great doctrinal and epistemological
attractiveness.

Arabic and Islamic Natural Philosophy and Natural Science,0.6266505718231201,0.13903169333934784,"


Natural philosophy, or physics, in the strict sense is the study of
natures; however, since by ‘nature’ most medieval natural
philosophers meant an internal principle of change or motion that
belongs to something essentially, natural philosophy came to be
identified more specifically with the study of motion and the
conditions purportedly necessary for motion, such as the infinite,
place, void and time. Within the medieval Arabic-speaking world there
were two primary intellectual traditions in which natural philosophy
was done: kalam and falsafa. Kalam, or
Islamic speculative theology, in general approached issues in physics
from an atomistic framework, which for some of these theologians
extended not only to the composition of bodies, but also to motion and
time as well, culminating among later Islamic theologians in an
occasionalist worldview that reserved causal agency for God alone.
falsafa, or simply ‘philosophy,’ had its roots in
the Greek intellectual world and more specifically in the philosophical
thought of Aristotle as he was interpreted by later Peripatetic and
Neoplatonic commentators with the additional supplementation by Galen
in biology and anatomy and Ptolemy in astronomy. The following account
begins with the atomistic theories found among the Islamic speculative
theologians followed by the developments in Aristotelian natural
philosophy by Arabic-speaking philosophers and their unique
contributions to that field.

Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic,0.6165112257003784,0.14455509185791016,"
Arabic logic is a philosophical tradition which has lasted from the
mid-eighth century down to today. For many years, western study of
Arabic logic tended to concentrate on the early parts of its history,
especially on the Greek antecedents of Arabic logic, and on the
writings of the foundational philosophers, Alfarabi (d. 950),
Avicenna (d. 1037) and Averroes (d. 1198). Recently,
however, there have been notable excursions beyond these areas of
traditional concentration, and I make a special effort in this entry
to mention the contributions of post-twelfth-century logicians to the
philosophical resolution of disputed
 points.[1] 
Section 1 of this entry gives some historical context for a vast
array of logical works, and section 2 provides a number of texts as
samples of the philosophical arguments they contain. The philosophical
assessment of the arguments is a task that is now underway in the
secondary literature, and I refer to some of these assessments in the
notes. My primary interest, however, is in presenting a set of texts
which illustrate the trajectory of arguments carried on through a
formative period of the discipline.
My own preferred term for the material I cover is “Arabic
logic.” The term as I use it refers to a tradition of logic
rooted in the texts translated from Greek into Arabic in a movement
beginning in the eighth century CE. The tradition gradually settled on
a set of technical terms with which to translate and discuss the
Aristotelian corpus and its associated late antique commentaries; it
also came to agree on what were the major problems in the corpus which
demanded resolution. Focussed at first on these problems, a continuous
line of discussions has evolved and carried forward in one form or
another down to today.
Arabic logic can be said to be Islamic in two senses, both—in
my opinion—of limited significance. First, it is as a result of
the Muslim conquests from the seventh century on that Arabic came to
be the primary language of learning. Beyond determining the language
into which the founding texts of the movement were translated,
however, the religion of the conquerors played no significant role in
the development of the subject. Secondly, the tradition of Arabic
logic after the thirteenth century was to find a place in the madrasa
education and, as a result, had to jostle with various Islamic
disciplines treating grammar, rhetoric and forensic argument; in the
process, Arabic logic gave up its claims to deal with dialectical,
rhetorical and poetical discourse. But by the time Arabic logic was
established in the curriculum of the institutions of learning, most of
the formal aspects of what was forever after to be called
“logic” (mantiq) had already crystallised.
Being conducted in Arabic is—on my
understanding—neither necessary nor sufficient for a logic to be
considered Arabic logic. The problematic of Arabic logic has been
adopted and its register of technical terms calqued or translated into
other languages such as Persian, Turkish, Hebrew and Urdu. To take one
of many possible examples, Nasîr al-Dîn
al-Tûsî's Asâs al-Iqtibâs, though
written in Persian, was apt for exact rendition in Arabic in the
fifteenth century precisely because it was Arabic logic written in
another language. By the same token, other traditions of logic have
been conducted in Arabic but are not, on my usage, Arabic logic. The
modern logic in the tradition inaugurated by Frege taught in most
modern Arab universities, often in Arabic, is not Arabic logic. So
too, if it is true that eighteenth-century Maronites wrote logical
treatises in Arabic based solely on the logic they had studied in
Rome, they were writing Latin logic in Arabic, not Arabic logic.

Arabic and Islamic Psychology and Philosophy of Mind,0.6225295066833496,0.18069499731063848,"


 Muslim philosophers considered the quest
for knowledge as a divine command, and knowledge of the soul, and
particularly of the intellect, as a critical component of this quest.
Mastery of this subject provided a framework within which the mechanics
and nature of our sensations and thoughts could be explained and
integrated, and offered the epistemological foundation for every other
field of inquiry. As opposed to the Occasionalist views of the
Mutakallimûn, the Muslim theologians, philosophers wished
to anchor their knowledge of the world in a stable and predictable
physical reality. This entailed naturalizing the soul (nafs in
Arabic) itself, charting the relation between its external and internal
senses and between its imaginative and rational faculties. However, the
ultimate goal of this subject, conjunction of the intellect with
universal truth, had a decidedly metaphysical and spiritual aspect.


 The psychological views delineated by
Aristotle were the dominant paradigm for Muslim philosophers, as
modified by Hellenistic variations expressing Platonic perspectives.

Greek Sources in Arabic and Islamic Philosophy,0.6012720465660095,0.16833221912384033,"


To some extent, scholars disagree about the role of the Greek
sources in Arabic and Islamic philosophy (henceforth falsafa,
the Arabic loan word for
 φιλοσοφία).[1]
While acknowledging the existence of a Greek heritage, those who
consider the Qur’an and the Islamic tradition as the main source
of inspiration for
falsafa claim that the latter did not arise from the encounter
of learned Muslims with the Greek philosophical heritage: instead,
according to them falsafa stemmed from the Qur’anic
hikma (“wisdom”). As a consequence, the Greek
texts in translation are conceived of as instruments for the
philosophers to perform the task of seeking
 wisdom.[2]
However, most scholars
frequently side with the opinion that what gave rise to the
intellectual tradition of falsafa was the so-called movement
of translation from
 Greek.[3]
This entry will not discuss the issue, let
alone try to settle it: it will limit itself to present the
philosophical Greek sources made available from the beginnings of the
translations into Arabic to the end of the 10th century. The reason for
focusing on the various stages of the assimilation of the Greek
heritage, instead of taking into account one by one all the works by
Plato, Aristotle etc. known to Arabic
 readers,[4]
is that it is useful to get an idea of what was translated at
different times. As a matter of fact, a living interplay took place,
especially in the formative period of
falsafa, between the doctrines of the philosophers writing in
Arabic and the Greek sources made available. Of momentous importance
for the development of falsafa was the simultaneous
translation of Aristotle’s Metaphysics and De Caelo,
some writings by Alexander of Aphrodisias (most of them of
a cosmological nature), Plotinus’
Enneads IV–VI, and Elements of Theology by
Proclus. Al-Kindi, the first faylasuf, initiated the
incorporation of the Aristotelian, Peripatetic and Neoplatonic
doctrines; at the same time, he reproduced them in his
philosophical works. Later on, the knowledge of the complete
Aristotelian corpus provided by another generation of translators,
without altering substantially this picture, produced a different
approach. The Aristotelian science as a systematic whole, ruled by
demonstration and made available together with Euclid, Ptolemy,
Hippocrates and Galen, paved the way for al-Farabi to build up the
project of a curriculum of higher education, which was meant to
subsume the native Islamic sciences in the broader system of the
liberal arts and philosophical sciences. Both the cross-pollination of
the Aristotelian and Neoplatonic traditions of the Kindian age, and
the rise of a complete system of rational sciences in the light of
Farabi’s educational syllabus of the philosopher-king, lie in the
background of Avicenna’s program to provide the summa of
demonstrative science—from logic to philosophical
theology—as a necessary step for the soul to return to its origin,
the intelligible realm (Endress 2006). When Averroes, two centuries
after the end of the age of the translations, resumed the project of
building up the demonstrative science as a systematic whole, he had
recourse to the Greek sources in Arabic translation which were
available in the Muslim West, mostly Aristotle and his
 commentators.[5]

Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on Judaic Thought,0.5657644271850586,0.1456936150789261,"

The ‘influence’ of Arabic and Islamic philosophy on Judaic
thought has never been studied as a whole: as a matter of fact, in
recent times it has not yet been the object of a comprehensive and
detailed analysis, apart from that made in a general article (Zonta
1997a; see also a wide table and a short sketch of the
Arabic-to-Hebrew philosophical works: Zonta 2011b and 2011c). That
article concentrated on some particular subjects of this
‘influence’, i.e. on the quotations, translations and
interpretations of the texts written by some Arab-Islamic philosophers
(the Brethren of Purity, Avicenna, and Averroes), but did not include
other authors, as al-Kindi, al-Ghazali or Ibn Bajja, nor some minor
figures which left some traces in Medieval Jewish philosophy. Of
course, the question of the general ‘influence’ of
Arab-Islamic philosophers on prominent authors as Ibn Gabirol and
Maimonides has been examined in specific articles and parts of books
(see in particular Pessin 2007, Davidson 2011, Pessin 2013). However,
this has not happened in the case of other Jewish authors, although a
number of more or less explicit or implicit references to Medieval
Arabic and Islamic philosophy have been found by modern scholars in
many Jewish authors, active in the period 900–1500: among the
most well-known of them, are Jacob al-Qirqisani, Isaac Israeli,
Solomon Ibn Gabirol, Bahya Ibn Paquda, Abraham bar Hiyya, Joseph Ibn
Zaddik, Moses Ibn Ezra, Judah Halevi, Abraham Ibn Daud, Moses
Maimonides, Samuel Ibn Tibbon, Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera, Levi ben
Gershom (Gersonides), Moses Narboni, and Hasdai Crescas. Usually, the
discovery of these references has not driven modern scholars to arrive
at even tentative conclusions about the real extent of this
‘influence’ and the ways of its spreading among Jewish
authors, apart from some particular cases – for example, that of
Arabic sources of 14th-century Jewish logic in Provence
(see Zonta 1997b).

Due to the complexity of the theme and the substantial shortage of
previous works especially and systematically devoted to it, a
comprehensive, if not detailed, analysis of the
‘influence’ of Arabic and Islamic philosophy on Judaic
thought should observe some limits. The concept of
“influence” in itself should be restricted to the cases
where a direct and evident, if not necessarily explicit, employment of
Arabic and Islamic sources by Jewish authors has been or can be
clearly ascertained. (For example, it is well-known that Maimonides
directly knew and employed a number of Arabic philosophical sources;
however, it should be admitted that, in many cases, Late Medieval
Jewish authors knew and employed these sources not directly, but
through Maimonides.) This analysis should not limit itself to the
cases when the text (or the texts) of an author were merely
“translated” into Hebrew or literally quoted in their
Arabic originals. These cases have been studied in some books
(Steinschneider 1893, Zonta 1996) and in a number of recent articles,
but such analysis should now spread to the cases where these texts
were commented on and in some cases directly and actually employed by
Jewish thinkers for building up their own philosophy. (In that regard,
it should be noted that many Late Medieval Jewish philosophers seem to
have known Avicenna’s philosophy; in reality, some of them might
have known it not directly, but mostly through al-Ghazali – as
might have happened even in the case of Maimonides too.) A historical
examination of this influence should proceed not according to the main
lines of the history of Jewish philosophy, but according to the
chronological order of the various Arabic and Islamic philosophers who
were read by Jewish authors, either in their original texts, or in
Medieval Hebrew translations, or in some cases even in Medieval Latin
versions – and it should be clear that Jewish philosophers
apparently did not employ as sources Arabic authors active after 1200
circa. Such examination should consider that “Arabic
philosophy” and “Islamic philosophy” cannot be
totally identified, but their relationship appears at times to be just
like the intersection of two not completely identical concepts. (For
example, some major works of Islamic philosophy like Avicenna’s
The Book of Science [Danesh name], were written in
Persian, while there were some Medieval Christian philosophers active
in the Near East who wrote their works in Arabic, and who should
better be put among the cases of “influence of
[Christian-]Arabic philosophy on Judaic thought”.)

Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West,0.6182045936584473,0.15435734391212466,"


The Arabic-Latin translation movements in the Middle Ages, which
paralleled that from Greek into Latin, led to the transformation of
almost all philosophical disciplines in the medieval Latin world. The
impact of Arabic philosophers such as al-Fārābī,
Avicenna and Averroes on Western philosophy was particularly strong in
natural philosophy, psychology and metaphysics, but also extended to
logic and ethics.


Among the influential Arabic theories are: the logical distinction
between first and second intentions; the intension and remission of
elementary forms; the soul's faculty of estimation and its object, the
intentions; the conjunction between human intellect and separate
active intellect; the unicity of the material intellect (Averroism);
naturalistic theories of miracles and prophecy; the eternity of the
world and the concept of eternal creation; the active intellect as
giver of forms; the first cause as necessary existent; the emanation
of intelligences from the first cause; the distinction between essence
and existence; the theory of primary concepts; the concept of human
happiness as resulting from perfect conjunction of the human intellect
with the active intellect.

Ibn Kammuna,0.5786025524139404,0.08170264959335327,"


The centuries following the remarkable achievement of Ibn Sina
(Avicenna; d. 1037) were a remarkably creative period in the sciences
and philosophy. Sa‘d ibn Mansur Ibn Kammuna, a Jew from Baghdad,
actively participated in the lively discourse of his day. In his
copious writings he takes up the entire gamut of philosophical issues
discussed by his contemporaries. Editions, translations and studies of
works by Ibn Kammuna and other thinkers of the time have appeared in
recent years. Nonetheless, it remains
difficult at this stage to contextualize Ibn Kammuna’s work, or to
decide wherein lies his most noteworthy contribution.

No topic so engaged Ibn Kammuna more than the study of the human soul,
especially its proper characterization and the proofs for its survival
after the death of the body. So, after first surveying Ibn Kammuna’s
biography, writings, and image, we will present Ibn Kammuna’s views on
the soul and its afterlife. Then we shall follow the thread of one
concept whose significance for the thought of the age has been firmly
established, namely, hads [properly transcribed with a dot
under the “h”, and most usually translated as
“intuition”], through his major writings. At the very
least, this shall afford us a glimpse at the way Ibn Kammuna handles a
key notion of psychology, epistemology, and the theory of prophecy, in
various literary formats. Following that, we will present the
first-ever survey of his religious ethics; the key texts have only
recently been published. Finally, we will have a look at some of the
sophistries and paradoxes that are attributed to him.


All agree that the publication of editions of Ibn Kammuna’s writings
(all of which are in Arabic) are a necessary first step in the study
of his contribution. There is far less agreement as to how to assess
the worth of editions, as well as the need or lack thereof for redoing
editions that are already available. Discussion of these and related
issues are essential to our topic, and bear upon the proper
understanding of Ibn Kammuna’s position on the issues of his day. With
this in mind, we will end with a short, critical discussion of some
editions that have appeared, just before the bibliography.

Ikhwân al-Safâ’,0.595345675945282,0.1352369338274002,"

The Ikhwân al-Safâ’ or “Brethren of
Purity”, as their name is commonly translated, are the authors
of one of the most complete Medieval encyclopedias of sciences,
antecedent at least two centuries to the best known in the Latin world
(by Alexander Neckham, Thomas de Cantimpré, Vincent de
Beauvais, Bartholomaeus Anglicus, all dating back to the
13th century). The “encyclopedia” is a
collection of Epistles, the Arabic title of which is
Rasâ’il Ikhwân al-Safâ’ wa
Khullân al-Wafâ’ (Epistles of the Pure Brethren
and the Sincere Friends). It consists of extremely heterogeneous
materials, reworked to represent the whole educational training
intended for an élite (see later). It is very well
known, and a great deal of research into it has been done by Eastern
and Western scholars, but the variety of topics addressed and the
questions raised as to the identity and ideology of its authors remain
unsolved. In an isolated form, and under a false attribution, some of
these treatises came to the Latin Middle Ages through the Spanish
version by Maslama al-Majrîtî, which is traditionally
placed at the beginnings of the 11th century. This already
discussed chronology (Carusi 2000, 494–500) is recently
questioned by de Callataÿ 2014. The development of research in
this direction was encouraged by the pioneer study, Fierro 1996, part.

Mysticism in Arabic and Islamic Philosophy,0.5942997336387634,0.09407508373260498,"


Mysticism in the Islamic context has traditionally been intertwined
with the notion of Ḥikmah, which is at once both wisdom
and philosophy (Nasr 1996). The source of mysticism and the mystical
elements in Islam are to be traced to the Qur’an and the Islamic
doctrine itself. Some of the Qur’anic verses have been
viewed by the mystics and philosopher-mystics of Islam as allegorical
and esoteric hints for those who can see them. “God is the
Outward and the Inward” (Qu’ran 57:3), “he for whom wisdom
is given, he truly has received abundant good” (Qu’ran
2:269), and the famous light verses

God is the Light of the heavens and the earth, the likeness of His
light is as a niche wherein is a lamp, the lamp is a glass, the glass
as it were a glittering star kindled from a blessed tree, an olive
that is neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil well-night
would shine, even if no fire touched it; light upon lights; God guides
to His light whom He will. And God strikes similitudes for man, and
God has knowledge of everything. (Qu’ran 24:35)
can all be seen as containing esoteric insight. Through out the
ages, these verses have inspired a number of Muslim gnostics, some of
whom, such as Shihāb al-Dīn Suhrawardī (12th
CE) and Mullā Ṣadrā (16th CE) have written
commentaries upon them (e.g., Mullā Ṣadrā’s
On the Hermeneutics of the Light Verse of the Quran).

From a mystical perspective, all later developments and interactions
between Islamic philosophy and other intellectual traditions should
therefore be seen as rational expressions of the mystical elements
within an Islamic milieu. Mystical elements exist in Islam in two
different and independent ways. Practically, Sufism represents the
esoteric dimension of Islam in its purest form, while theoretically
salient features of Islamic mysticism were gradually incorporated into
the Islamic philosophical tradition. Islamic mysticism, therefore,
stands on two pillars: first practical, then philosophical. That is,
esoteric wisdom can either be attained through practical wisdom, which
includes inner purification and asceticism, or through a type of
philosophy which includes, but is not limited to discursive
reasoning.

Arcesilaus,0.4836513102054596,0.218699648976326,"


Arcesilaus (316/5-241/0 BCE) was a member and later leader
(‘scholarch’) of Plato's Academy. He initiated the skeptical
phase of the Platonic school (‘Academic skepticism’) and was an
influential critic of Stoic epistemology.


The ancient evidence about Arcesilaus' philosophy is difficult to
evaluate and, in some respects, inconsistent. As a result, scholars
interpret his skepticism in several ways. Some see his philosophical
activity as entirely negative or destructive of all philosophical
views. Others regard him as endorsing the position that nothing can be
known on the basis of philosophical arguments he is committed to. This
would make his skepticism similar to Descartes' at the start of the
Meditations, where he doubts everything he previously thought
he knew. Others take him to have held no positive views on any
philosophical topic, including the possibility of knowledge. On this
view, his skepticism is very similar to the Pyrrhonian skepticism
advocated by Sextus Empiricus: the skeptic is someone who refuses to
accept any philosophical theory or proposition as rationally warranted,
and insists that further examination is always required.

Philosophy of Architecture,0.5778606534004211,0.5276129841804504,"
This article offers an overview of issues in the philosophy of
architecture. Central issues include foundational matters regarding
the nature of:

Architecture as an artform, design medium, or other product or
practice.
Architectural objects—what sorts of things they are; how
they differ from other sorts of objects; and how we define the range
of such objects.
Special architectural properties, like the standard trio of
structural integrity (firmitas), beauty, and utility—or
space, light, and form; and ways they might be special to
architecture.
Architectural types—how to consider abstract groups of
architectural objects and their instances.
Meaning and other language-like phenomena in architecture and its
objects.
Formation of and warrant for our basic grasp, and considered
judgment, of architectural objects.
Social and moral features of architectural objects and
architectural practice.

Yet other questions engage applied philosophical concerns regarding
architecture, such as the character of architectural notation;
intellectual property rights; and client-architect obligations.
A far-reaching philosophy of architecture extends beyond even a
broadly aesthetics-based assessment, to include considerations of
ethics, social and political philosophy, and philosophical reflections
on psychology and the behavioral sciences. The aesthetics of
architecture, by itself, spans traditional issues mooted in philosophy
of art, as well as aesthetics of the everyday, and environmental
aesthetics. Such traditional issues include the nature of the work;
the possibility of classes, kinds, or types in the domain; the
character and roles of representation, intentionality, and expression;
and the warranted foundations for criticism. The ethics of
architecture also addresses traditional issues, including delineation
of rights, responsibilities, the good, virtues, and justice in
architectural milieus. Still other aspects of philosophy of
architecture concern social and technological characteristics.

Archytas,0.6958067417144775,0.03735858574509621,"

Archytas of Tarentum was a Greek mathematician, political leader and
philosopher, active in the first half of the fourth century BC (i.e.,
during Plato’s lifetime). He was the last prominent figure in the
early Pythagorean tradition and the dominant political figure in
Tarentum, being elected general seven consecutive times. He sent a
ship to rescue Plato from the clutches of the tyrant of Syracuse,
Dionysius II, in 361, but his personal and philosophical connections
to Plato are complex, and there are many signs of disagreement between
the two philosophers. A great number of works were forged in Archytas’
name starting in the first century BC, and only four fragments of his
genuine work survive, although these are supplemented by a number of
important testimonia. Archytas was the first to solve one of the most
celebrated mathematical problems in antiquity, the duplication of the
cube. We also have his proof showing that ratios of the form
(n+1) : n, which are important in music theory,
cannot be divided by a mean proportional. He was the most
sophisticated of the Pythagorean harmonic theorists and provided
mathematical accounts of musical scales used by the practicing
musicians of his day. Fr. 1 of Archytas may be the earliest text to
identify the group of four canonical sciences (logistic [arithmetic],
geometry, astronomy and music), which would become known as the
quadrivium in the middle ages. There are also some
indications that he contributed to the development of the science of
optics and laid the mathematical foundations for the science of
mechanics. He saw the ultimate goal of the sciences as the description
of individual things in the world in terms of ratio and proportion and
accordingly regarded logistic, the science of number and proportion,
as the master science. Rational calculation and an understanding of
proportion were also the bases of the just state and of the good life
for an individual. He gave definitions of things that took account of
both their matter and their form. Although we have little information
about his cosmology, he developed the most famous argument for the
infinity of the universe in antiquity.

Hannah Arendt (1906–1975) was one of the most influential political
philosophers of the twentieth century. Born into a German-Jewish
family, she was forced to leave Germany in 1933 and lived in Paris for
the next eight years, working for a number of Jewish refugee
organisations. In 1941 she immigrated to the United States and soon
became part of a lively intellectual circle in New York. She held a
number of academic positions at various American universities until
her death in 1975. She is best known for two works that had a major
impact both within and outside the academic community. The first,
The Origins of Totalitarianism, published in 1951, was a
study of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes that generated a wide-ranging
debate on the nature and historical antecedents of the totalitarian
phenomenon. The second, The Human Condition, published in
1958, was an original philosophical study that investigated the
fundamental categories of the vita activa (labor, work,
action). In addition to these two important works, Arendt published a
number of influential essays on topics such as the nature of
revolution, freedom, authority, tradition and the modern age. At the
time of her death in 1975, she had completed the first two volumes of
her last major philosophical work, The Life of the Mind,
which examined the three fundamental faculties of the vita
contemplativa (thinking, willing, judging).

Epistemic Utility Arguments for Probabilism,0.8702335357666016,0.8755554556846619,"
Our beliefs come in degrees; we believe some more strongly than
others. For instance, I believe that the sun will rise tomorrow more
strongly than I believe that it will rise every morning for the coming
week; and I believe both of these propositions much more strongly than
I believe that there will be an earthquake tomorrow in Bristol. We
call the strength or the degree of our belief in a proposition
our credence in that proposition. Suppose I know that a die
is to be rolled, and I believe that it will land on six more strongly
than I believe that it will land on an even number. In this case, we
would say that there is something wrong with my credences, for if it
lands on six, it lands on an even number, and I ought not to believe a
proposition more strongly than I believe any of its logical
consequences. This is a consequence of a popular doctrine in the
epistemology of credences called Probabilism, which
says that our credences at a given time ought to satisfy the axioms of
the probability calculus (given in detail below). Since this says
something about how our credences ought to be rather than how
they in fact are, we call this an epistemic norm.
In this entry, we explore a particular strategy that we might
deploy when we wish to establish an epistemic norm such
as Probabilism. It is called epistemic utility
theory, or sometimes cognitive decision
theory, epistemic decision theory, or
even accuracy-first or accuracy-centered
epistemology. I will use the former. Epistemic utility theory is
inspired by traditional utility theory, so let’s begin with a
quick summary of that.
Traditional utility theory (also known as decision theory, see
entry on normative
theories of rational choice: expected utility) explores a
particular strategy for establishing the norms that govern which
actions it is rational for us to perform in a given situation. Given a
particular situation, the framework for the theory includes states
of the world that are relevant to the situation, actions
that are available to the agent in the situation, and the
agent’s utility function, which takes a state of the
world and an action and returns a measure of the extent to which she
values the outcome of performing that action at that world. We call
this measure the utility of the outcome at the world. For
example, there might be just two relevant states of the world: one in
which it rains and one in which it does not. And there might be just
two relevant actions from which to choose: take an umbrella when you
leave the house or don’t. Then your utility function will
measure how much you value the outcomes of each action at each state
of the world: that is, it will give the value of being in the rain
without an umbrella, being in the rain with an umbrella, being with an
umbrella when there is no rain, and being without an umbrella when
there is no rain. With this framework in hand, we can state certain
very general norms of action in terms of it. For instance, we might
say that an agent ought not to perform an action if there is some
other action that has greater utility than it at every possible state
of the world. This norm is called Naive Dominance. We
will have a lot to say about it in section
5.1 below.
In epistemic utility theory, the states of the world remain the
same, but the possible actions an agent might perform are replaced by
the possible epistemic states she might adopt, and the
utility function is replaced, for each agent, by an epistemic
utility function, which takes a state of the world and a possible
epistemic state and returns a measure of the purely epistemic value
that the agent attaches to being in that epistemic state at that state
of the world. So, in epistemic utility theory, we appeal to epistemic
utility to ask which of a range of possible epistemic states it is
rational to adopt, just as in traditional utility theory we appeal to
non-epistemic, pragmatic utility to ask which of a range of possible
actions it is rational to perform. In fact, we will often talk of
epistemic disutility rather than epistemic utility in this
entry. But it is easy to translate between them. If \(\mathfrak{EU}\)
is an epistemic utility function, then \(-\mathfrak{EU}\) is an
epistemic disutility function, and vice versa.
Again, certain very general norms may be stated, such as the
obvious analogue of Naive Dominance from above. Thus,
before the die is rolled, we might ask whether I should adopt an
epistemic state in which I believe that the die will land on six more
strongly than I believe that it will land on an even number. And we
might be able to show that I shouldn’t because there is some
other epistemic state I could adopt instead that will have greater
epistemic utility however the world turns out. In this case, we appeal
to the epistemic version of Naive Dominance to show
what is wrong with my credences. This is an example of how epistemic
utility theory might come to justify Probabilism. As
we will see, arguments just like this have indeed been given. In this
entry, we explore these arguments.

Aristotelianism in the Renaissance,0.6495270729064941,0.12470515072345735,"


“Renaissance” is used as a useful short label for the
period ca. 1348 to ca. 1648. But the use of the term
“Aristotelianism” as applied to texts, contents and
contexts of that period is
 problematic.[1]  
 Some authors did indeed consider themselves as part of a
“peripatetic” (i.e., Aristotelian) current or
 school,[2]  
 but it would be counterintuitive to limit the application of the term
“Aristotelianism” only to those authors of whom such
statements are known (since it probably would exclude most Renaissance
commentators on Aristotle). [3] 
 On the other hand, if we use the term
“Aristotelianism” to denote everything in Renaissance
philosophy that with some high degree of probability makes direct or
indirect use of Aristotle’s texts: this would mean that
“Aristotelianism in the Renaissance” and “Philosophy
in the Renaissance” are equivalent terms (cf. Keßler
1990).


However, there are texts in Renaissance philosophy that are obviously
more “Aristotelian” than others, namely, the
commentaries on texts by Aristotle.  There are more of them
than we have from any other period of the history of philosophy. And
in many of the Renaissance universities philosophy training
was keyed to the interpretation of texts by Aristotle and often
involved the use of textbooks derived from works by Aristotle and his
commentators. In addition to this, the corpus Aristotelicum
was used as a matrix for textbooks and encyclopedias and as a
starting point for treatises on more or less special philosophical
 questions.[4]

Aristotle,0.6589894294738771,0.14927642047405246,"


Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) numbers among the greatest
philosophers of all time. Judged solely in terms of his philosophical
influence, only Plato is his peer: Aristotle’s works shaped centuries
of philosophy from Late Antiquity through the Renaissance, and even
today continue to be studied with keen, non-antiquarian interest. A
prodigious researcher and writer, Aristotle left a great body of work,
perhaps numbering as many as two-hundred treatises, from which
approximately thirty-one
 survive.[1] 
 His extant writings span a wide range of
disciplines, from logic, metaphysics and philosophy of mind, through
ethics, political theory, aesthetics and rhetoric, and into such
primarily non-philosophical fields as empirical biology, where he
excelled at detailed plant and animal observation and description. 
In all these areas, Aristotle’s theories have provided
illumination, met with resistance, sparked debate, and generally
stimulated the sustained interest of an abiding readership.


Because of its wide range and its remoteness in time,
Aristotle’s philosophy defies easy encapsulation. The long
history of interpretation and appropriation of Aristotelian texts and
themes—spanning over two millennia and comprising philosophers
working within a variety of religious and secular traditions—has
rendered even basic points of interpretation controversial. The
set of entries on Aristotle in this site addresses this situation by
proceeding in three tiers. First, the present, general entry
offers a brief account of Aristotle’s life and characterizes his
central philosophical commitments, highlighting his most distinctive
methods and most influential
 achievements.[2] 
 Second are General Topics, which offer detailed introductions
to the main areas of Aristotle’s philosophical activity. Finally,
there follow Special Topics, which investigate in greater
detail more narrowly focused issues, especially those of central
concern in recent Aristotelian scholarship.

philosophy as their author: a set of introductory lectures on
philosophy, a commentary on Porphyry’s Introduction, and a
commentary on Aristotle’s Categories that nowadays is
attributed to Elias. The name is commonly taken, on the basis of
evidence internal to these works, to refer to a Christian Neoplatonic
philosopher and commentator who presumably worked in Alexandria in the
middle or the second half of the 6th century, or even later. This
‘David’ is also commonly identified with David the
Invincible, an important figure in the early history of Armenian
philosophy, but biographical identifications of this kind are
extremely precarious.

Elias,0.6437473893165588,0.08321776986122131,"

“Elias” is the name of an author which, in the course of a
complicated history of textual transmission, has become associated
with some manuscripts of late-antique commentaries on Aristotle and
Porphyry. On the basis of a certain similarity in style and content,
it is generally supposed that the works transmitted under the name of
“Elias,” just like the works attributed to
“David,” emerged from the school of Olympiodorus at
Alexandria and that the author lived and worked there in the second
half of the 6th century CE. However, good evidence that a Neoplatonic
philosopher bearing the Christian monastic name “Elias”
ever existed is in fact scant. In this article “Elias” is
used to refer to the assumed author of the commentaries nowadays
attributed to him. (See further below, section 3.)

Olympiodorus,0.6402499675750732,0.07641077786684036,"


Olympiodorus of Alexandria, presumably a late pupil of Ammonius Hermeiou,
the commentator on Aristotle and teacher of Simplicius and Philoponus,
was one of the last pagans to teach philosophy at the school of
Alexandria in the 6th century. In his lectures, he
interpreted classical philosophical texts, mainly by Plato and
Aristotle; we still possess three of his commentaries on Plato and two
on Aristotle. At times, these seem to be carefully crafted pieces of
pedagogy, but at other times they read more like transcripts drawn up
by one of the students. Although Olympiodorus comes across as a
learned man and guardian of traditional paideia, both
literary and philosophical, his œuvre compares unfavorably, from
a philosophical standpoint, with commentaries written by either
Ammonius or Olympiodorus’ contemporaries such as Simplicius and John
Philoponus. Still, his work is valuable in that it affords us vivid
insights into the way in which pagan philosophy was taught to young
members of the Christian elite who, for the most part, would move into
careers in the clergy or at the Byzantine court. The 6th
century Alexandrian Olympiodorus must be distinguished from another
Olympiodorus who supposedly lived in the first half of the
5th century C.E. and was said by Marinus in his Life of
Proclus to have been a teacher of the latter at Athens. No better
evidence of this earlier figure survives. The relationship of the
younger philosopher Olympiodorus to an alchemist, supposedly of the
same name and provenance, remains a matter of dispute.

John Philoponus, a Christian philosopher, scientist, and theologian
who lived approximately from 490 to 570, is also known as John the
Grammarian or John of Alexandria. The epithet ‘Philoponus’
means literally ‘Lover of toil’.  Philoponus' life and
work are closely connected to the city of Alexandria and the
Alexandrian Neoplatonic school. Although the Aristotelian-Neoplatonic
tradition was the source of his intellectual roots and concerns, he
was an original thinker who eventually broke with that tradition in
many important respects, both substantive and methodological, and
cleared part of the way which led to more critical and empirical
approaches in the natural sciences. Which intellectual, religious, or
other cultural circumstances of his life and times may have put
Philoponus into the position to initiate and foreshadow the eventual
demise of Aristotelianism is one of the most fascinating questions
anyone who tries to arrive at a fuller appreciation of the work of
this important late Greek philosopher faces.

Aristotle's Biology,0.6532890796661377,0.1402088701725006,"

Aristotle is properly recognized as the originator of the scientific
study of life. This is true despite the fact that many earlier Greek
natural philosophers occasionally speculated on the origins of living
things and much of the Hippocratic medical corpus, which was written
before or during Aristotle’s lifetime, displays a serious
interest in human anatomy, physiology and pathology. Even Plato has
Timaeus devote a considerable part of his speech to the human body and
its functions (and malfunctions). Nevertheless, before Aristotle, only
a few of the Hippocratic treatises are both systematic and empirical,
and their focus is almost exclusively on human health and disease.

By contrast, Aristotle considered the investigation of living things,
and especially animals, central to the theoretical study of nature.
Constituting roughly 25% of the extant corpus, his zoological writings
provide a theoretical defense of the proper method for
biological investigation; and they provide a record of the first
systematic and comprehensive study of animals. There was nothing of
similar scope and sophistication again until the 16th
century. In the nineteenth century the great anatomist Richard Owen
introduced a two lecture survey of Aristotle’s zoological
studies by declaring that “Zoological Science sprang from his
[Aristotle’s] labours, we may almost say, like Minerva from the
Head of Jove, in a state of noble and splendid maturity” (Owen
1992, 91). Before examining this remarkable achievement, a few words
about its creator are in

Aristotle's Categories,0.6607022285461426,0.15568651258945465,"


Aristotle's Categories is a singularly important work
of philosophy. It not only presents the backbone of
Aristotle's own philosophical theorizing, but has exerted an
unparalleled influence on the systems of many of the greatest
philosophers in the western tradition. The set of
doctrines in the Categories, which I will henceforth call
categorialism, provides the framework of inquiry for a wide
variety of Aristotle's philosophical investigations, ranging from
his discussions of time and change in the Physics, to the
science of being qua being in the Metaphysics, and
even extending to his rejection of Platonic ethics in the
Nicomachean Ethics. Looking beyond his own works,
Aristotle's categorialism has engaged the attention of such
diverse philosophers as Plotinus, Porphyry, Aquinas, Descartes,
Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Brentano and
Heidegger (to mention just a few), who have variously embraced,
defended, modified or rejected its central contentions. All, in
their different ways, have thought it necessary to come to terms with
features of Aristotle's categorial scheme.


Plainly, the enterprise of categorialism inaugurated by Aristotle runs
deep in the philosophical psyche. Even so, despite its
wide-reaching influence — and, indeed owing to that influence —
any attempt to describe categorialism faces a significant
difficulty: experts disagree on many of its most important and
fundamental aspects. Each of the following questions has received
markedly different answers from highly respected scholars and
philosophers. What do the categories classify? What theory
of predication underlies Aristotle's scheme? What is the
relationship between categorialism and hylemorphism, Aristotle's
other major ontological theory? Where does matter fit, if at all,
in the categorial scheme? When did Aristotle write the
Categories? Did Aristotle write the
Categories? Is the list of kinds in the
Categories Aristotle's considered list, or does he
modify his views elsewhere? Is Aristotle's view of
substance in the Categories consistent with his view of
substance in the Metaphysics? Is there some method that
Aristotle used in order to generate his list of categories? Is
Aristotle's categorialism philosophically defensible in whole or
in part? If only in part, which part of categorialism is
philosophically defensible?


Given the divergence of expert opinion about even the most basic
aspects of Aristotle's Categories, it is inevitable that
an attempt to give a neutral account of the basic positions it contains
will be seen as wrong headed, perhaps drastically so, by some scholar or
other. One could attempt to address this problem by commenting on
every scholarly debate and opinion; but such a project would fail to
bring to life the most striking features of Aristotelian
categorialism. In what follows, therefore, I shall take a
different route. I first present a natural, though perhaps overly
simplified, interpretation of the main structures in Aristotle's
categorial scheme, while pausing en route to note some
especially controversial points. I then go on to discuss one
important scholarly and philosophical debate about the categories,
namely the question of whether there is some systematic procedure by
which Aristotle generated his famous list. The debate
is of interest in large part because it concerns one of the most
fundamental metaphysical topics: what is the correct system of
categories? I am not ultimately concerned to present the
correct interpretation of Aristotle's
Categories. Rather, I only hope to provide a useful
introduction to the content of this endlessly fascinating
work.

Aristotle's Ethics,0.5120238065719604,0.5632894039154053,"

Aristotle conceives of ethical theory as a field distinct from the
theoretical sciences. Its methodology must match its subject
matter—good action—and must respect the fact that in this
field many generalizations hold only for the most part. We study
ethics in order to improve our lives, and therefore its principal
concern is the nature of human well-being. Aristotle follows Socrates
and Plato in taking the virtues to be central to a well-lived life.
Like Plato, he regards the ethical virtues (justice, courage,
temperance and so on) as complex rational, emotional and social
skills. But he rejects Plato's idea that to be completely virtuous one
must acquire, through a training in the sciences, mathematics, and
philosophy, an understanding of what goodness is. What we need, in
order to live well, is a proper appreciation of the way in which such
goods as friendship, pleasure, virtue, honor and wealth fit together
as a whole. In order to apply that general understanding to particular
cases, we must acquire, through proper upbringing and habits, the
ability to see, on each occasion, which course of action is best
supported by reasons. Therefore practical wisdom, as he conceives it,
cannot be acquired solely by learning general rules. We must also
acquire, through practice, those deliberative, emotional, and social
skills that enable us to put our general understanding of well-being
into practice in ways that are suitable to each occasion.

Aristotle's Logic,0.665921151638031,0.14583729207515714,"

Aristotle’s logic, especially his theory of the syllogism, has
had an unparalleled influence on the history of Western thought. It
did not always hold this position: in the Hellenistic period, Stoic
logic, and in particular the work of Chrysippus, took pride of place.
However, in later antiquity, following the work of Aristotelian
Commentators, Aristotle’s logic became dominant, and
Aristotelian logic was what was transmitted to the Arabic and the
Latin medieval traditions, while the works of Chrysippus have not
survived. 

This unique historical position has not always contributed to the
understanding of Aristotle’s logical works. Kant thought that
Aristotle had discovered everything there was to know about logic, and
the historian of logic Prantl drew the corollary that any logician
after Aristotle who said anything new was confused, stupid, or
perverse. During the rise of modern formal logic following Frege and
Peirce, adherents of Traditional Logic (seen as the descendant of
Aristotelian Logic) and the new mathematical logic tended to see one
another as rivals, with incompatible notions of logic. More recent
scholarship has often applied the very techniques of mathematical
logic to Aristotle’s theories, revealing (in the opinion of
many) a number of similarities of approach and interest between
Aristotle and modern logicians.

This article is written from the latter perspective. As such, it is
about Aristotle’s logic, which is not always the same thing as
what has been called “Aristotelian” logic.

The first major work in the history of philosophy to bear the title
“Metaphysics” was the treatise by Aristotle that we have

century C.E. editor who assembled the treatise we know as
Aristotle’s Metaphysics out of various smaller
selections of Aristotle’s works. The title
‘metaphysics’—literally, ‘after the
Physics’—very likely indicated the place the
topics discussed therein were intended to occupy in the philosophical

Aristotle's Political Theory,0.4457563161849976,0.6131950616836548,"

Aristotle (b. 384 – d. 322 BCE), was a Greek philosopher,
logician, and scientist. Along with his teacher Plato, Aristotle is
generally regarded as one of the most influential ancient thinkers in
a number of philosophical fields, including political theory.
Aristotle was born in Stagira in northern Greece, and his father was a
court physician to the king of Macedon. As a young man he studied in
Plato's Academy in Athens. After Plato's death he left Athens to
conduct philosophical and biological research in Asia Minor and
Lesbos, and he was then invited by King Philip II of Macedon to tutor
his young son, Alexander the Great. Soon after Alexander succeeded his
father, consolidated the conquest of the Greek city-states, and
launched the invasion of the Persian Empire. Aristotle returned as a
resident alien to Athens, and was a close friend of Antipater, the
Macedonian viceroy. At this time (335–323 BCE) he wrote, or at
least worked on, some of his major treatises, including the
Politics. When Alexander died suddenly, Aristotle had to flee
from Athens because of his Macedonian connections, and he died soon
after. Aristotle's life seems to have influenced his political thought
in various ways: his interest in biology seems to be expressed in the
naturalism of his politics; his interest in comparative politics and
his sympathies for democracy as well as monarchy may have been
encouraged by his travels and experience of diverse political systems;
he criticizes harshly, while borrowing extensively, from Plato's
Republic, Statesman, and Laws; and his own
Politics is intended to guide rulers and statesmen,
reflecting the high political circles in which he moved.

Aristotle (384–322 BC) was born in Macedon, in what is now northern
Greece, but spent most of his adult life in Athens. His life in Athens
divides into two periods, first as a member of Plato’s Academy
(367–347) and later as director of his own school, the Lyceum
(334–323). The intervening years were spent mainly in Assos and Lesbos,
and briefly back in Macedon. His years away from Athens were
predominantly taken up with biological research and writing. Judged on
the basis of their content, Aristotle’s most important psychological
writings probably belong to his second residence in Athens, and so to
his most mature period. His principal work in psychology, De
Anima, reflects in different ways his pervasive interest in
biological taxonomy and his most sophisticated physical and
metaphysical theory.


Because of the long tradition of exposition which has developed
around Aristotle’s De Anima, the interpretation of even its
most central theses is sometimes disputed. Moreover, because of its
evident affinities with some prominent approaches in contemporary
philosophy of mind, Aristotle’s psychology has received renewed
interest and has incited intense interpretative dispute in recent
decades. Consequently, this entry proceeds on two levels. The main
article recounts the principal and distinctive claims of Aristotle’s
psychology, avoiding so far as possible exegetical controversy and
critical commentary. At the end of appropriate sections of the main
article, readers are invited to explore problematic or advanced

Aristotle's Rhetoric,0.673084557056427,0.1424054205417633,"


Aristotle's Rhetoric has had an enormous influence on the 
development of the art of rhetoric. Not only authors writing in the 
peripatetic tradition, but also the famous Roman teachers of 
rhetoric, such as Cicero and Quintilian, frequently used elements 
stemming from the Aristotelian doctrine. Nevertheless, these authors 
were interested neither in an authentic interpretation of the 
Aristotelian works nor in the philosophical sources and backgrounds 
of the vocabulary that Aristotle had introduced to rhetorical theory.
Thus, for two millennia the interpretation of Aristotelian rhetoric 
has become a matter of the history of rhetoric, not of philosophy. In
the most influential manuscripts and editions, Aristotle's 
Rhetoric was surrounded by rhetorical works and even written
speeches of other Greek and Latin authors, and was seldom interpreted
in the context of the whole Corpus Aristotelicum. It was not until 
the last few decades that the philosophically salient features of the
Aristotelian rhetoric were rediscovered: in construing a general 
theory of the persuasive, Aristotle applies numerous concepts and 
arguments that are also treated in his logical, ethical, and 
psychological writings. His theory of rhetorical arguments, for 
example, is only one further application of his general doctrine of 
the sullogismos, which also forms the basis of dialectic, 
logic, and his theory of demonstration. Another example is the 
concept of emotions: though emotions are one of the most important 
topics in the Aristotelian ethics, he nowhere offers such an 
illuminating account of single emotions as in the Rhetoric. 
Finally, it is the Rhetoric, too, that informs us about the 
cognitive features of language and style.

Each Aristotelian science consists in the causal investigation of a
specific department of reality. If successful, such an investigation
results in causal knowledge; that is, knowledge of the relevant or
appropriate causes. The emphasis on the concept of cause explains why
Aristotle developed a theory of causality which is commonly known as
the doctrine of the four causes. For Aristotle, a firm grasp of what a
cause is, and how many kinds of causes there are, is essential for a
successful investigation of the world around us.

Aristotle uses mathematics and mathematical sciences in three important
ways in his treatises. Contemporary mathematics serves as a model for
his philosophy of science and provides some important techniques, e.g.,
as used in his logic. Throughout the corpus, he constructs mathematical
arguments for various theses, especially in the physical writings, but
also in the biology and ethics. Finally, Aristotle's philosophy of
mathematics provides an important alternative to platonism. In this
regard, there has been a revival of interest in recent years because of
its affinity to physicalism and fictionalisms based on physicalism.
However, his philosophy of mathematics may better be understood as a
philosophy of exact or mathematical sciences.

Aristotle's Natural Philosophy,0.6456791162490845,0.15181025862693787,"


Aristotle had a lifelong interest in the study of nature. He
investigated a variety of different topics, ranging from general
issues like motion, causation, place and time, to systematic
explorations and explanations of natural phenomena across different
kinds of natural entities. These different inquiries are integrated
into the framework of a single overarching enterprise describing the
domain of natural entities. Aristotle provides the general theoretical
framework for this enterprise in his Physics, a treatise which
divides into two main parts, the first an inquiry into nature (books
1–4) and the second a treatment of motion (books
 5–8).[1]
 In this work, Aristotle sets out the conceptual apparatus for his
analysis, provides definitions of his fundamental concepts, and argues
for specific theses about motion, causation, place and time, and
establishes in bk. 8 the existence of the unmoved mover of the
universe, a supra-physical entity, without which the physical domain
could not remain in existence. He takes up problems of special
interest to physics (such as the problem of generation and perishing)
in a series of further physical treatises, some of which are devoted
to particular physical domains: the  De generatione et corruptione
(On Generation and Perishing), the De caelo (On the
 Heavens),[2]
 and the Meteorology, which lead up to the treatises on
biology and psychology.[3]

 The science of physics, Aristotle stresses, contains almost all there
is to know about the world. Were there no separate
forms—entities such as the unmoved mover at the pinnacle of the
cosmos—which are without matter and are not part of the physical
world, physics would be what Aristotle calls first philosophy
(Metaphysics 6.1, 1026a27–31).  As there are such separate
entities, physics is dependent on these, and is only a second
philosophy (Metaphysics 7.11, 1037a14f).  Nevertheless, the
interaction between these two “philosophies” is not
completely exhausted by the causal influence exerted on the world by
the supra-physical entities—the prime movers 
as it turns out. Aristotle’s metaphysics 
and physics use a common conceptual framework, and they often address 
similar issues. The prime and distinctive task of first philosophy is 
an inquiry into first entities; these, however, are not perceptible 
entities, and as a result they have to be investigated through a 
metaphysical investigation of physical entities.  Hence the overlap 
between the two disciplines, which often verges on inseparability.

Aristotle on Non-contradiction,0.6657856106758118,0.15441663563251495,"


According to Aristotle, first philosophy, or metaphysics, deals with
ontology and first principles, of which the principle (or law) of
non-contradiction is the firmest. Aristotle says that without the
principle of non-contradiction we could not know anything that we do
know. Presumably, we could not demarcate the subject matter of any of
the special sciences, for example, biology or mathematics, and we
would not be able to distinguish between what something is, for
example a human being or a rabbit, and what it is like, for example
pale or white. Aristotle's own distinction between essence and
accident would be impossible to draw, and the inability to draw
distinctions in general would make rational discussion
impossible. According to Aristotle, the principle of non-contradiction
is a principle of scientific inquiry, reasoning and communication that
we cannot do without.


Aristotle's main and most famous discussion of the principle of
non-contradiction occurs in Metaphysics IV (Gamma) 3–6,
especially 4. There are also snippets of discussion about the
principle of non-contradiction early in the corpus, for example in
De Interpretatione, and there is the obscure chapter 11 of
Posterior Analytics I, but none of these rival Aristotle's
treatment of the principle of non-contradiction in
Metaphysics IV. The discussion below mostly concerns the main
interpretative and philosophical issues that arise from reading
Metaphysics IV 3–6.


Aristotle's discussion of the principle of non-contradiction also
raises thorny issues in many areas of modern philosophy, for example,
questions about what we are committed to by our beliefs, the
relationship between language, thought and the world, and the status
of transcendental arguments. Arguments from conflicting appearances
have proved remarkably long-lived, and debates about skepticism,
realism and anti-realism continue to this day.

Antoine Arnauld (1612–1694) was a powerful figure in the
intellectual life of seventeenth-century Europe. He had a long and
highly controversial career as a theologian, and was an able and
influential philosopher. His writings were published and widely read
over a period of more than fifty years and were assembled in
1775–1782 in forty-two large folio volumes.

Evaluations of Arnauld’s work as a theologian vary. Ian Hacking,
for example, says that Arnauld was “perhaps the most brilliant
theologian of his time” (Hacking 1975a, 25). Ronald Knox, on the
other hand, says, “It was the fashion among the Jansenists to
represent Antoine Arnauld as a great theologian; he should be
remembered, rather as a great controversialist… A theologian by
trade, Arnauld was a barrister by instinct” (Knox 1950, 196). It
is agreed on all sides, however, that Arnauld was acute and learned in
theology as well as in philosophy.

Arnauld was an important participant in the philosophical debates of
his century, and carried out famous intellectual exchanges with
Descartes, Malebranche, and Leibniz. In addition, the Port-Royal
Logic, l’Art de penser, which he co-authored with
Pierre Nicole, was a standard text in the field for two centuries.
Less attention has been paid to Arnauld’s lifelong efforts to
reconcile the doctrine of grâce efficace par
elle-même with freedom of will, though they have many
connections with the debate about determinism and free will that
continues to this day.

François-Marie d'Arouet (1694–1778), better known by his
pen name Voltaire, was a French writer and public activist who played
a singular role in defining the eighteenth-century movement called the
Enlightenment. At the center of his work was a new conception of
philosophy and the philosopher that in several crucial respects
influenced the modern concept of each. Yet in other ways Voltaire was
not a philosopher at all in the modern sense of the term. He wrote as
many plays, stories, and poems as patently philosophical tracts, and
he in fact directed many of his critical writings against the
philosophical pretensions of recognized philosophers such as Leibniz,
Malebranche, and Descartes. He was, however, a vigorous defender of a
conception of natural science that served in his mind as the antidote
to vain and fruitless philosophical investigation. In clarifying this
new distinction between science and philosophy, and especially in
fighting vigorously for it in public campaigns directed against the
perceived enemies of fanaticism and superstition, Voltaire pointed
modern philosophy down several paths that it subsequently
followed.


To capture Voltaire's unconventional place in the history of
philosophy, this article will be structured in a particular
way. First, a full account of Voltaire's life is offered, not merely
as background context for his philosophical work, but as an argument
about the way that his particular career produced his particular

Kenneth Arrow's “impossibility” theorem—or
“general possibility” theorem, as he called
it—answers a very basic question in the theory of collective
decision-making. Say there are some alternatives to choose among. They
could be policies, public projects, candidates in an election,
distributions of income and labour requirements among the members of a
society, or just about anything else. There are some people whose
preferences will inform this choice, and the question is: which
procedures are there for deriving, from what is known or can be found
out about their preferences, a collective or “social”
ordering of the alternatives from better to worse? The answer is
startling. Arrow's theorem says there are no such procedures
whatsoever—none, anyway, that satisfy certain apparently quite
reasonable assumptions concerning the autonomy of the people and the
rationality of their preferences. The technical framework in which
Arrow gave the question of social orderings a precise sense and its
rigorous answer is now widely used for studying problems in welfare
economics. The impossibility theorem itself set much of the agenda for
contemporary social choice theory. Arrow accomplished this while still
a graduate student. In 1972, he received the Nobel Prize in economics

between the nude and the naked? Can we draw a strict line between
erotic art and pornography? We tend to think of art as complex and of
pornography as one-dimensional, but how compelling is that differentiation?
Pornography is often considered harmful, objectifying, and
exploitative, but to what extent is erotic art immune to moral
criticism of this sort? In addressing such questions this entry will
provide an overview of current philosophical debates on erotic art. It
will also place those debates in historical perspective and, in the
closing section, explore some important avenues for future
research.

Conceptual Art,0.5806941986083984,0.5050897598266602,"


The philosophy of art addresses a broad spectrum of theoretical issues
arising from a wide variety of objects of attention. These range from
Paleolithic cave painting to postmodern poetry, and from the problem
of how music can convey emotion to that of the metaphysical status of
fictional characters. Until recently, however, philosophical interest
in conceptual art, or conceptualism, has been notably sparse. Why?
After all, both philosophy and the myriad kinds and styles of art
and art-making that fall under the conceptual tradition all have one
thing in common: they are both intended to make you think and ask
pressing questions. What are those questions and how do we go about
answering them?

[Editor's Note: The following new entry by Beth Preston replaces the
 former entry
 on this topic by the previous author.]


The contemporary world is pervasively artifactual. Even our most
mundane, biologically based activities, such as eating, sleeping, and
sex, depend on engagement with artifacts. Moreover, many of the plants
and animals we encounter on a daily basis qualify as biological
artifacts (Sperber 2007). But unlike language—which also
pervades human life from top to bottom—artifacts as such are not
the subject matter of any well-defined area of philosophical research.
This is as much the case today as it has been throughout the history
of Western philosophy (Dipert 1993).

Philosophy of technology might have played this role, but historically
it has not done so. Although its roots reach back to the
19th century, philosophy of technology became a widely
recognized specialization only in the second half of the
20th century. This early phase was dominated by so-called
“humanities philosophy of technology” (Mitcham 1994).
Heavily influenced by Martin Heidegger’s (1954 [1977]) seminal
essay, “The Question Concerning Technology”, this strain
of philosophy of technology focuses primarily on the cultural and
social effects of industrial and post-industrial technologies. In the
last few decades, a companion strain of philosophy of technology,
variously denominated “analytic” (Franssen, Lokhorst,
& van de Poel 2015) or “engineering philosophy of
technology” (Mitcham 1994) has come to prominence. It is focused
on the genesis of technologies in the practices of modern science and
engineering. Thus the net effect has been to focus philosophy of
technology almost exclusively on modern and emerging technologies,
rather than on artifacts in general.

The aim of this article, then, is to bring together discussions of
artifacts occurring in sometimes far-flung areas of philosophy, as
well as related discussions in other disciplines. Section 1 concerns
questions of definition. Section 2 focuses on the metaphysics of
artifacts. Section 3 turns to epistemological issues. There are also
important normative issues concerning artifacts, but these are covered
in other articles in this Encyclopedia, listed in the Related Entries

Artificial Intelligence,0.9396344423294068,0.6598166823387146,"

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field devoted to building
artificial animals (or at least artificial creatures that – in
suitable contexts – appear to be animals) and, for
many, artificial persons (or at least artificial creatures that
– in suitable contexts – appear to be
 persons).[1]
 Such goals immediately ensure that AI is a discipline of considerable
interest to many philosophers, and this has been confirmed (e.g.) by
the energetic attempt, on the part of numerous philosophers, to show
that these goals are in fact un/attainable. On the constructive side,
many of the core formalisms and techniques used in AI come out of, and
are indeed still much used and refined in, philosophy: first-order
logic and its extensions; intensional logics suitable for the modeling
of doxastic attitudes and deontic reasoning; inductive logic,
probability theory, and probabilistic reasoning; practical reasoning
and planning, and so on. In light of this, some philosophers conduct
AI research and development as philosophy. 

In the present entry, the history of AI is briefly recounted, proposed
definitions of the field are discussed, and an overview of the field
is provided. In addition, both philosophical AI (AI pursued as and out
of philosophy) and philosophy of AI are discussed, via
examples of both. The entry ends with some de rigueur
speculative commentary regarding the future of AI.

Automated Reasoning,0.8815299868583679,0.7774330973625183,"


Reasoning is the ability to make inferences, and automated reasoning is
concerned with the building of computing systems that automate this
process. Although the overall goal is to mechanize different forms of
reasoning, the term has largely been identified with valid deductive
reasoning as practiced in mathematics and formal logic. In this
respect, automated reasoning is akin to mechanical theorem proving.
Building an automated reasoning program means providing an algorithmic
description to a formal calculus so that it can be implemented on a
computer to prove theorems of the calculus in an efficient manner.
Important aspects of this exercise involve defining the class of
problems the program will be required to solve, deciding what language
will be used by the program to represent the information given to it as
well as new information inferred by the program, specifying the
mechanism that the program will use to conduct deductive inferences,
and figuring out how to perform all these computations efficiently.
While basic research work continues in order to provide the necessary
theoretical framework, the field has reached a point where automated
reasoning programs are being used by researchers to attack open
questions in mathematics and logic, and to solve problems in
engineering.

Formal Representations of Belief,0.8628928661346436,0.8465240001678467,"

Epistemology is the study of knowledge and justified belief. Belief is
thus central to epistemology. It comes in a qualitative form, as when
Sophia believes that Vienna is the capital of Austria, and a
quantitative form, as when Sophia’s degree of belief that Vienna
is the capital of Austria is at least twice her degree of belief that
tomorrow it will be sunny in Vienna. Formal epistemology, as opposed
to mainstream epistemology (Hendricks 2006), is epistemology done in a
formal way, that is, by employing tools from logic and mathematics.
The goal of this entry is to give the reader an overview of the formal
tools available to epistemologists for the representation of belief. A
particular focus will be on the relation between formal
representations of qualitative belief and formal representations of
quantitative degrees of belief.

The Chinese Room Argument,0.6729608178138733,0.4851766526699066,"

The argument and thought-experiment now generally known as the Chinese
Room Argument was first published in a paper in 1980 by American
philosopher John Searle (1932- ).  It has become one of the best-known
arguments in recent philosophy.  Searle imagines himself alone in a
room following a computer program for responding to Chinese characters
slipped under the door.  Searle understands nothing of Chinese, and
yet, by following the program for manipulating symbols and numerals
just as a computer does, he produces appropriate strings of Chinese
characters that fool those outside into thinking there is a Chinese
speaker in the room. The narrow conclusion of the argument is that
programming a digital computer may make it appear to understand
language but does not produce real understanding.  Hence the “Turing
Test” is inadequate.  Searle argues that the thought experiment
underscores the fact that computers merely use syntactic rules to
manipulate symbol strings, but have no understanding of meaning or
semantics. The broader conclusion of the argument is that the theory
that human minds are computer-like computational or information
processing systems is refuted.  Instead minds must result from
biological processes; computers can at best simulate these biological
processes.  Thus the argument has large implications for semantics,
philosophy of language and mind, theories of consciousness, computer
science and cognitive science generally. As a result, there have been
many critical replies to the argument.

Connectionism,0.8240917325019836,0.4338735640048981,"


Connectionism is a movement in cognitive science that hopes to
explain intellectual abilities using artificial neural networks
(also known as ‘neural networks’ or ‘neural
nets’). Neural networks are simplified models of the brain
composed of large numbers of units (the analogs of neurons) together
with weights that measure the strength of connections between the
units. These weights model the effects of the synapses that link one
neuron to another. Experiments on models of this kind have demonstrated
an ability to learn such skills as face recognition, reading, and the
detection of simple grammatical structure.


Philosophers have become interested in connectionism because it
promises to provide an alternative to the classical theory of the mind:
the widely held view that the mind is something akin to a digital
computer processing a symbolic language. Exactly how and to what extent
the connectionist paradigm constitutes a challenge to classicism has
been a matter of hot debate in recent years.

Defeasible Reasoning,0.8076723217964172,0.8090642690658569,"

Reasoning is defeasible when the corresponding argument is
rationally compelling but not deductively valid. The truth of the
premises of a good defeasible argument provide support for the
conclusion, even though it is possible for the premises to be true and
the conclusion false. In other words, the relationship of support
between premises and conclusion is a tentative one, potentially
defeated by additional information. Philosophers have studied the
nature of defeasible reasoning since Aristotle’s analysis of
dialectical reasoning in the Topics and the
Posterior Analytics, but the subject has been studied with
unique intensity over the last forty years, largely due to the
interest it attracted from the artificial intelligence movement in
computer science. There have been two approaches to the study of
reasoning: treating it either as a branch of epistemology (the study
of knowledge) or as a branch of logic. In recent work, the term
defeasible reasoning has typically been limited to inferences
involving rough-and-ready, exception-permitting generalizations, that
is, inferring what has or will happen on the basis of what
normally happens. This narrower sense of defeasible
reasoning, which will be the subject of this article, excludes
from the topic the study of other forms of non-deductive reasoning,
including inference to the best explanation, abduction, analogical
reasoning, and scientific induction. This exclusion is to some extent
artificial, but it reflects the fact that the formal study of these
other forms of non-deductive reasoning remains quite rudimentary.

To most AI researchers, the frame problem is the challenge of
representing the effects of action in logic without having to represent
explicitly a large number of intuitively obvious non-effects. But to many
philosophers, the AI researchers' frame problem is suggestive of
wider epistemological issues. Is it possible, in principle, to limit
the scope of the reasoning required to derive the consequences of an
action? And, more generally, how do we account for our apparent ability
to make decisions on the basis only of what is relevant to an ongoing
situation without having explicitly to consider all that is not
relevant?

Logic and Artificial Intelligence,0.8154867887496948,0.808491051197052,"


Artificial Intelligence (which I'll refer to hereafter by its nickname,
“AI”) is the subfield of Computer Science devoted to developing
programs that enable computers to display behavior that can (broadly)
be characterized as
 intelligent.[1]
 Most research in AI is devoted to
fairly narrow applications, such as planning or speech-to-speech
translation in limited, well defined task domains. But substantial
interest remains in the long-range goal of building generally
intelligent, autonomous
 agents,[2]
 even if the goal of fully human-like intelligence is elusive and
is seldom pursued explicitly and as such.


Throughout its relatively short history, AI has been heavily
influenced by logical ideas. AI has drawn on many research
methodologies:  the value and relative importance of logical formalisms
is questioned by some leading practitioners, and has been debated in
the literature from time to
 time.[3]
 But most members of the AI community
would agree that logic has an important role to play in at least some
central areas of AI research, and an influential minority considers
logic to be the most important factor in enabling strategic,
fundamental advances.


The relations between AI and philosophical logic are part of a
larger story. It is hard to find a major philosophical theme that
doesn't become entangled with issues having to do with reasoning.
Implicatures, for instance, have to correspond to inferences that can
be carried out by a rational interpreter of discourse. Whatever
causality is, causal relations should be inferrable in everyday common
sense settings. Whatever belief is, it should be possible for rational
agents to make plausible inferences about the beliefs of other agents.
The goals and standing constraints that inform a rational agent's
behavior must permit the formation of reasonable plans.


In each of these cases, compatibility with an acceptable account of
the relevant reasoning is essential for a successful philosophical
theory. But the methods in the contemporary philosophical inventory are
too crude to provide anything like an adequate account of reasoning
that is this complex and this entangled in broad world knowledge.


Bringing an eclectic set of conceptual tools to the problem of
idealized reasoning in realistic settings, and using computers to model
and test the theories, research in AI has transformed the study of
reasoning—especially of practical, common sense reasoning. This
process and its outcome is well documented in
 Russell & Norvig 2010.


The new insights and theories that have emerged from AI are, I
believe, of great potential value in informing and constraining many
areas of philosophical inquiry. The special case of philosophical logic that
forms the theme of this article may provide support for the more
general point. Although logic in AI grew out of philosophical logic, in
its new setting it has produced new theories and ambitious programs
that would not have been possible outside of a community devoted to
building full-scale computational models of rational agency.


I imagine that the audience for this entry will consist primarily of
philosophers who have little or no familiarity with AI. In writing this
survey, I have tried to concentrate on the issues that arise when logic
is used in understanding problems in intelligent reasoning and guiding
the design of mechanized reasoning systems. Logic in AI is a large and
rapidly growing field—I haven't tried to achieve anything like
complete coverage. In
 Section 3
 and
 Section 4
 I have tried to provide an overview with some historical and
technical details concerning nonmonotonic logic and reasoning about
action and change, a topic that is not only central in AI but that
should be of considerable interest to philosophers. The remaining
sections provide brief and more or less inadequate sketches of
selected topics, with references to the primary literature.

Minker 2000b is a comprehensive
collection of survey papers and original contributions to the field of
logic-based AI, with extensive references to the literature.  Jack Minker's
introduction, Minker 2000a, is a useful
orientation to the field. I recommend this volume as
a beginning point for readers who wish to pursue this topic
further.  Brachman

knowledge representation in textbook form.  
Davis 1991a and
Mueller 2006a are book-length treatments
of the challenging problem of formalizing commonsense reasoning.  
Antonelli 2012a is a good entry point
for readers interested in nonmonotonic logic, and
Shanahan 2009a is a useful discussion of
the frame problem.  
Wooldridge 2000a deals with logical
formalizations of rational agents.

The Turing Test,0.9492416977882384,0.6629306674003601,"


The phrase “The Turing Test” is most properly used to
refer to a proposal made by Turing (1950) as a way of dealing with the
question whether machines can think. According to Turing, the question
whether machines can think is itself “too meaningless” to
deserve discussion (442). However, if we consider the more
precise—and somehow related—question whether a digital computer
can do well in a certain kind of game that Turing describes
(“The Imitation Game”), then—at least in Turing's
eyes—we do have a question that admits of precise
discussion. Moreover, as we shall see, Turing himself thought that it
would not be too long before we did have digital computers that could
“do well” in the Imitation Game.


The phrase “The Turing Test” is sometimes used more
generally to refer to some kinds of behavioural tests for the presence
of mind, or thought, or intelligence in putatively minded entities. So,
for example, it is sometimes suggested that The Turing Test is
prefigured in Descartes' Discourse on the Method. (Copeland
(2000:527) finds an anticipation of the test in the 1668 writings of
the Cartesian de Cordemoy. Gunderson (1964) provides an early instance
of those who find that Turing's work is foreshadowed in the work of
Descartes.) In the Discourse, Descartes says:
If there were machines which bore a resemblance to our
bodies and imitated our actions as closely as possible for all
practical purposes, we should still have two very certain means of
recognizing that they were not real men. The first is that they could
never use words, or put together signs, as we do in order to declare
our thoughts to others. For we can certainly conceive of a machine so
constructed that it utters words, and even utters words that correspond
to bodily actions causing a change in its organs. … But it is
not conceivable that such a machine should produce different
arrangements of words so as to give an appropriately meaningful answer
to whatever is said in its presence, as the dullest of men can do.
Secondly, even though some machines might do some things as well as we
do them, or perhaps even better, they would inevitably fail in others,
which would reveal that they are acting not from understanding, but
only from the disposition of their organs. For whereas reason is a
universal instrument, which can be used in all kinds of situations,
these organs need some particular action; hence it is for all practical
purposes impossible for a machine to have enough different organs to
make it act in all the contingencies of life in the way in which our
reason makes us act. (Translation by Robert Stoothoff)


Although not everything about this passage is perfectly clear, it
does seem that Descartes gives a negative answer to the question
whether machines can think; and, moreover, it seems that his giving
this negative answer is tied to his confidence that no mere machine
could pass The Turing Test: no mere machine could talk and act in the
way in which adult human beings do. Since Descartes explicitly says
that there are “two very certain means” by which we can
rule out that something is a machine—it is, according to Descartes,
inconceivable that a mere machine could produce different arrangements
of words so as to give an appropriately meaningful answer to whatever
is said in its presence; and it is for all practical purposes
impossible for a machine to have enough different organs to make it act
in all the contingencies of life in the way in which our reason makes
us act—it seems that he must agree with the further claim that
nothing that can produce different arrangements of words so as to give
an appropriately meaningful answer to whatever is said in its presence
can be a machine. Given the further assumption—which one suspects
that Descartes would have been prepared to grant—that only things
that think can produce different arrangements of words so as to give an
appropriately meaningful answer to whatever is said in their presence,
it seems to follow that Descartes would have agreed that the Turing
Test would be a good test of his confident assumption that there cannot
be thinking machines. Given the knowledge that something is indeed a
machine, evidence that that thing can produce different arrangements of
words so as to give an appropriately meaningful answer to whatever is
said in its presence is evidence that there can be thinking
machines.


The phrase “The Turing Test” is also sometimes used to
refer to certain kinds of purely behavioural allegedly logically
sufficient conditions for the presence of mind, or thought, or
intelligence, in putatively minded entities. So, for example, Ned
Block's “Blockhead” thought experiment is often said to be
a (putative) knockdown objection to The Turing Test. (Block (1981)
contains a direct discussion of The Turing Test in this context.) Here,
what a proponent of this view has in mind is the idea that it is
logically possible for an entity to pass the kinds of tests
that Descartes and (at least allegedly) Turing have in mind—to use
words (and, perhaps, to act) in just the kind of way that human beings
do—and yet to be entirely lacking in intelligence, not possessed of
a mind, etc.


The subsequent discussion takes up the preceding ideas in the order
in which they have been introduced. First, there is a discussion of
Turing's paper (1950), and of the arguments contained therein. Second,
there is a discussion of current assessments of various proposals that
have been called “The Turing Test” (whether or not there is
much merit in the application of this label to the proposals in
question). Third, there is a brief discussion of some recent writings
on The Turing Test, including some discussion of the question whether
The Turing Test sets an appropriate goal for research into artificial
intelligence. Finally, there is a very short discussion of Searle's
Chinese Room argument, and, in particular, of the bearing of this
argument on The Turing Test.

Tense and Aspect,0.8251538276672363,0.8268770575523376,"


Time flies like an arrow.… Fruit flies like a banana.
—Oettinger (1966)


Many languages have grammatical means to indicate the time when an
action or event occurs, or when a state or process holds. This
phenomenon is called tense. In English, for example, adding
the morpheme -ed to the verb walk, to form
walked, indicates that the event denoted by the verb occurred
before the present time. What is called aspect, on the other
hand, deals with the internal constituency of actions, events, states,
processes or situations. For instance, it may indicate that an action
is completed or still ongoing. English typically uses the
-ing form of verbs to indicate ongoing processes, as in
He is building a house. 

After a short introduction to basic notions of tense and aspect we
briefly discuss temporal logic, and then Reichenbach’s famous
distinction between speech time, event time and reference time. These
sections are followed by a discussion of the most important
observations concerning lexical and grammatical aspect, including the
famous imperfective paradox. Next we introduce two widely discussed
theories of temporality and show how they cope with the imperfective
paradox. Event-based semantic theories treat events as ontological
primitives, so in the following section we show how time can be
constructed from event structures, as exemplified by the Russell-Kamp
construction. This section is followed by one that shows how temporal
information is expressed in Artificial Intelligence (AI). We use the
event calculus from AI to present a solution of the imperfective
paradox, by viewing it as an instance of the frame problem. The last
section is devoted to gathering psycholinguistic evidence showing that
at least some of the philosophical and semantic concepts discussed in
this article may be cognitively real.

Assertion,0.7545037865638733,0.7348563075065613,"
An assertion is a speech act in which something is claimed to hold,
for instance that there are infinitely many prime numbers, or, with
respect to some time t, that there is a traffic
congestion on Brooklyn Bridge at t, or, of some person x
with respect to some time t, that x has a tooth ache at
t. The concept of assertion has occupied a central place in the
philosophy of language, since it is often thought that making
assertions is the use of language most crucial to linguistic
meaning. In recent years, by contrast, most of the interest in
assertion has come from epistemology.
The nature of assertion and its relation to other categories and
phenomena have been subject to much controversy. Some of the ideas of
assertion will be presented below. The article will situate assertion
within speech act theory and pragmatics more generally, and then go on
to present the current main accounts of
assertion.[1]
By an account of assertion is here meant a theory of what
it consists in to make an assertion. According to such
accounts, there are deep properties of assertion: specifying
those properties is specifying what a speaker essentially
does in making an assertion (e.g., express a
belief). There must also be surface properties, which
are the properties by which we can tell whether an utterance is an
assertion, for instance that it is made by means of uttering a sentence in
the indicative mood. Some accounts specify deep properties only, while
others relate deep properties to surface properties, as we shall
see.

Associationism is one of the oldest, and, in some form or another,
most widely held theories of thought. Associationism has been the
engine behind empiricism for centuries, from the British Empiricists
through the Behaviorists and modern day Connectionists. Nevertheless,
“associationism” does not refer to one particular theory
of cognition per se, but rather a constellation of related
though separable theses. What ties these theses together is a
commitment to a certain arationality of thought: a creature’s
mental states are associated because of some facts about its causal
history, and having these mental states associated entails that
bringing one of a pair of associates to mind will, ceteris
paribus, ensure that the other also becomes activated.

Atomism from the 17th to the 20th Century,0.8825951814651489,0.2979904115200043,"


Atomism in the form in which it first emerged in Ancient Greece was a
metaphysical thesis, purporting to establish claims about the ultimate
nature of material reality by philosophical argument. Versions of
atomism developed by mechanical philosophers in the seventeenth
century shared that characteristic. By contrast, the knowledge of
atoms that is now taken for granted in modern science is not
established by a priori philosophical argument but by appeal
to quite specific experimental results interpreted and guided by a
quite specific theory, quantum mechanics. If metaphysics involves an
attempt to give an account of the basic nature of material reality
then it is an issue about which science rather than philosophy has
most to say. A study of the path from philosophical atomism to
contemporary scientific atomism helps to shed light on the nature of
philosophy and science and the relationship between the two.

scientific atomism first emerged, the philosophical relevance of a
history of atomism becomes epistemological rather than metaphysical.
Since atoms lie far beyond the domain of observation, should
hypotheses concerning them form part of empirical science? There were
certainly philosophers and scientists of the nineteenth century who
answered that question in the negative. Contemporary philosophers
differ over the question of whether the debate was essentially a
scientific one or a philosophical one. Was there a case to oppose
atomism on the grounds that it was unfruitful or lacking in adequate
experimental support, or did such a case stem from some general
epistemological thesis, perhaps some brand of positivism, that ruled
out of court any attempt to explain observable phenomena by invoking
unobservable atoms? Many contemporary philosophers see the ultimate
triumph of atomism as a victory for realism over positivism. Such
claims are historical as well as philosophical, so it is important to
get the history straight when evaluating them. In this respect the
philosophical literature has yet to catch up with recent advances in
the history of nineteenth-century chemistry. This entry gives an
account of the key developments in atomism from the seventeenth
century until the time, early in the twentieth century, when the
existence of atoms ceased to be a contentious issue. The focus is on
the epistemological status of the various versions, and on the
relationship between science and philosophy.

Ancient Atomism,0.6229121088981628,0.023425308987498283,"


A number of important theorists in ancient Greek natural philosophy
held that the universe is composed of physical ‘atoms’,
literally ‘uncuttables’. Some of these figures are treated
in more depth in other articles in this encyclopedia: the reader is
encouraged to consult individual entries on Leucippus, Democritus,
Epicurus and Lucretius. These philosophers developed a systematic and
comprehensive natural philosophy accounting for the origins of
everything from the interaction of indivisible bodies, as these
atoms—which have only a few intrinsic properties like size and
shape—strike against one another, rebound and interlock in an
infinite void. This atomist natural philosophy eschewed teleological
explanation and denied divine intervention or design, regarding every
composite of atoms as produced purely by material interactions of
bodies, and accounting for the perceived properties of macroscopic
bodies as produced by these same atomic interactions. Atomists
formulated views on ethics, theology, political philosophy and
epistemology consistent with this physical system. This powerful and
consistent materialism, somewhat modified from its original form by
Epicurus, was regarded by Aristotle as a chief competitor to
teleological natural philosophy.


Since the Greek adjective atomos means, literally,
‘uncuttable,’ the history of ancient atomism is not only
the history of a theory about the nature of matter, but also the
history of the idea that there are indivisible parts in any kind of
magnitude—geometrical extension, time, etc. Although the term
‘atomism’ is most often identified with the systems of
natural philosophy mentioned above, scholars have also identified
commitments to indivisibles in a number of lesser known figures. Often
these are formulated in response to paradoxes like those of Zeno of
Elea (early 5th c. BCE) about infinite divisibility of
magnitudes. Some of these identifications of other kinds of atomism
outside the main tradition are controversial and based on slight
evidence.

Attention,0.7363923788070679,0.4177838265895844,"

Attention is involved in the selective directedness of our mental
lives. The nature of this selectivity is one of the principal points
of disagreement between the extant theories of attention. Some of the
most influential theories treat the selectivity of attention as
resulting from limitations in the brain’s capacity to process
the complex properties of multiple perceptual stimuli. Other theories
take the selectivity of attention to be the result of limitations in
the thinking subject’s capacity to consciously entertain
multiple trains of thought. A third group of theories account for
attention’s selectivity in ways that need not make any reference
to limitations in capacity. These latter theories relate the
selectivity of attention to the selectivity required to maintain a
single coherent course of action, to the weighting of sensory
information in accordance with its expected precision, or to
competition between mutually inhibitory streams of processing. 

The instances of attention differ along several dimensions of
variation. In some of its instances attention is a perceptual
phenomenon. In other instances it is a phenomenon related to
action. In some instances the selectivity of attention is
voluntary. In other instances it is driven, quite independently of the
subject’s volition, by the high salience of attention-grabbing
items in the perceptual field. The difficulty of giving a unified
theory of attention that applies to attention’s voluntary and
involuntary instances, and to its perceptual and enactive instances,
makes attention a topic of philosophical interest in its own right.


Attention is also a topic of philosophical interest because of its
apparent relations to a number of other philosophically puzzling
phenomena. There are empirical and theoretical considerations
suggesting that attention is closely related to
consciousness, and there are controversies over whether this
relationship of consciousness to attention is one of necessity, or
sufficiency (or both or neither). There are also controversies –
thought to be important to the viability of representationism about
consciousness – over the ways in which the phenomenal character
of a conscious experience can be modulated by attention. Different
considerations link attention to demonstrative reference, to
the development of an understanding of other minds, and to
the exercise of the will. Some work in the tradition of
virtue ethics takes attention to be morally important, since
there are at least some virtues that require one to attend
appropriately. 

The controversies concerning attention’s relation to these other
phenomena often include debates about the philosophical significance
of theories that have been developed through the empirical study of
attention at the neuropsychological level, and at the cognitive
level.

Properties,0.7956146597862244,0.5374324321746826,"

Properties (also called ‘attributes,’
‘qualities,’ ‘features,’
‘characteristics,’ ‘types’) are those entities
that can be predicated of things or, in other words, attributed to
them. Moreover, properties are entities that things are said to bear,
possess or exemplify. For example, if we say that that thing over
there is an apple and is red, we are presumably attributing the
properties red and apple to it, and, if the
attribution is veridical, the thing in question exemplifies this
property. Thus, properties can be characterized both as
predicables and as exemplifiables. Relations, e.g.,
loving and between, can also be viewed as
predicables and exemplifiables. More generally they can be treated in
many respects on a par with properties and indeed they may even be
viewed as kinds of properties. Accordingly, this entry will also
discuss them to some extent, although they are treated in more detail
in another entry:
 relations.
 

Questions about the nature and existence of properties are nearly as
old as philosophy itself. Interest in properties has ebbed and flowed
over the centuries, but it has undergone a resurgence since at least
the second half of the last century and keeps flourishing. The recent
collections by Galluzzo & Loux (2015) and Marmodoro & Yates
(forthcoming) well testify this trend. This entry will focus primarily
on what has been done in this field in the last few decades (taking up
where Loux’s (1972) earlier review of the literature leaves
off).

Philosophers who argue that properties exist almost always do so
because they think properties are needed to solve certain
philosophical problems, and their views about the nature of
properties are strongly influenced by the problems they think
properties are needed to solve. So a good deal of discussion here will
be devoted to the tasks properties have been introduced to perform and
the ways in which these tasks influence accounts of the nature of
properties.

In §1 we introduce some distinctions and terminology that will be
useful in subsequent discussion. In §2 we deal with the central
topic of what it is for properties to be exemplified. §3 contains
a discussion of traditional attempts to use properties to explain
phenomena in metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of language.
§4 focuses on the three areas where contemporary philosophers
have offered the most detailed accounts based on properties:
philosophy of mathematics, the semantics of natural languages, and
topics in a more nebulous area that might be called naturalistic
ontology. We then turn to issues about the nature of properties,
including their existence conditions (§5), their identity
conditions (§6), and the various sorts of properties there might
be (§7). §8 provides an introductory, informal discussion of
formal theories of properties.

Saint Augustine,0.6903857588768005,0.20680715143680573,"

Aurelius Augustinus [more commonly “St. Augustine of
Hippo,” often simply “Augustine”] (354–430
C.E.): rhetor, Christian Neoplatonist, North African Bishop,
Doctor of the Roman Catholic Church. One of the decisive developments
in the western philosophical tradition was the eventually widespread
merging of the Greek philosophical tradition and the Judeo-Christian
religious and scriptural traditions. Augustine is one of the main
figures through and by whom this merging was accomplished. He is, as
well, one of the towering figures of medieval philosophy whose
authority and thought came to exert a pervasive and enduring influence
well into the modern period (e.g. Descartes and especially
Malebranche), and even up to the present day, especially among those
sympathetic to the religious tradition which he helped to shape (e.g.
Plantinga 1992; Adams 1999). But even for those who do not share this
sympathy, there is much in Augustine's thought that is worthy of
serious philosophical attention. Augustine is not only one of the
major sources whereby classical philosophy in general and Neoplatonism
in particular enter into the mainstream of early and subsequent
medieval philosophy, but there are significant contributions of his
own that emerge from his modification of that Greco-Roman inheritance,
e.g., his subtle accounts of belief and authority, his account of
knowledge and illumination, his emphasis upon the importance and
centrality of the will, and his focus upon a new way of
conceptualizing the phenomena of human history, just to cite a few of
the more conspicuous examples.

Authenticity,0.5400987863540649,0.5193005204200745,"
The term ‘authentic’ is used either in the strong sense
of being “of undisputed origin or authorship”, or in a
weaker sense of being “faithful to an original” or a
“reliable, accurate representation”. To say that something
is authentic is to say that it is what it professes to be, or what it
is reputed to be, in origin or authorship. But the distinction between
authentic and derivative is more complicated when discussing
authenticity as a characteristic attributed to human beings. For in
this case, the question arises: What is it to be oneself, at one with
oneself, or truly representing one's self? The multiplicity of puzzles
that arise in conjunction with the conception of authenticity connects
with metaphysical, epistemological, and moral issues. On the one hand,
being oneself is inescapable, since whenever one makes a choice or
acts, it is oneself who is doing these things. But on the other hand,
we are sometimes inclined to say that some of the thoughts, decisions
and actions that we undertake are not really one's own and
are therefore not genuinely expressive of who one is. Here, the issue
is no longer of metaphysical nature, but rather about
moral-psychology, identity and responsibility.
When used in this latter sense, the characterization describes a
person who acts in accordance with desires, motives, ideals or beliefs
that are not only hers (as opposed to someone else's), but that also
express who she really is. Bernard Williams captures this when he
specifies authenticity as “the idea that some things are in some
sense really you, or express what you are, and others aren't”
(quoted in Guignon 2004: viii).
Besides being a topic in philosophical debates, authenticity is
also a pervasive ideal that impacts social and political
thinking. In fact, one distinctive feature of recent Western
intellectual developments has been a shift to what is called the
“age of authenticity” (Taylor 2007; Ferrarra 1998).
Therefore, understanding the concept also involves investigating its
historical and philosophical sources and on the way it impacts the
socio-political outlook of contemporary societies.

Authority,0.4170691668987274,0.7226775884628296,"


When is political authority legitimate?  This is one of the
fundamental questions of political philosophy.  Depending on how one
understands political authority this question may be the same as, when
is coercion by the state legitimate?  Or, when do we have duties to
obey the state?  Or, when and who has a right to rule through the
state? 
This entry is concerned with the philosophical issues that arise in
the justification of political authority.  First, this entry will
examine some of the main conceptual issues that arise relating to
political authority.  What do we mean by political authority?  This
entry distinguishes political authority from political power, and the
idea of morally legitimate political authority from descriptive ideas
of authority.  It also distinguishes between authority in the sense of
morally justified coercion and authority in the sense of capacity to
impose duties on others and finally from authority as right to rule.
Further distinctions concern the nature of the duties that political
authority imposes on subjects. 
The main part of the entry (section
 4) 
 concerns the nature and merits of different accounts of the
legitimacy of political authority.  Under what conditions is political
authority legitimate?  This entry discusses five different views of
the legitimacy of political authority.  It discusses the
instrumentalist theory according to which authority is legitimate to
the extent that it gets people to do what they already have a duty to
do.  It discusses the consent theory of authority according to which
authority is legitimate only if the subjects have consented to it.  It
discusses the theory advanced by John Rawls that authority is
legitimate if and only if it acts in accord with principles the
subjects agree to.  It discusses Ronald Dworkin's view according to
which legitimate political authority is a kin to the basis of
obligations to friendships, families and other associations.  Finally
it discusses the democratic conception of authority according to which
the democratic assembly has legitimate political authority within
certains limits because it treats every citizen as an equal in the
process of making law.

Whatever else they do, all legal systems recognize, create, vary and
enforce obligations. This is no accident: obligations are central to
the social role of law and explaining them is necessary to an
understanding of law's authority and, therefore, its nature. Not only
are there obligations in the law, there are also obligations
to the law. Historically, most philosophers agreed that these
include a moral obligation to obey, or what is usually called
“political obligation.” Voluntarists maintained that this
requires something like a voluntary subjection to law's rule, for
example, through consent. Non-voluntarists denied this, insisting that
the value of a just and effective legal system is itself sufficient to
validate law's claims. Both lines of argument have recently come under
intense scrutiny, and some philosophers now deny that law is entitled
to all the authority it claims for itself, even when the legal system
is legitimate and reasonably just. On this view there are legal
obligations that some of law's subjects have no moral obligation to
perform.

Few principles are as often identified with bioethics as informed
consent. In clinical practice, the doctrine of informed consent rose
to dominance during the course of the 20th century. It replaced a
medical ethos founded on trust in physicians' decisions—often on
the assumption that “doctor knows best”—with an
ethos that sought to put patients in charge of their own care. In
medical research on human subjects, informed consent requirements
gained prominence in reaction to abuses. One influential response to
the cruelty of Nazi experiments was the Nuremberg Code of research ethics, which stipulated, “The voluntary consent of the
human subject is absolutely essential” (Faden and Beauchamp
1986, 156). But why should we require informed consent when it comes
at a cost to the individual's health? What is the content, the scope,
and the status of that requirement? How does informed consent in

Autonomy in Moral and Political Philosophy,0.5269631147384644,0.7526623606681824,"


Individual autonomy is an idea that is generally understood to refer
to the capacity to be one's own person, to live one's life according
to reasons and motives that are taken as one's own and not the product
of manipulative or distorting external forces. It is a central value
in the Kantian tradition of moral philosophy but it is also given
fundamental status in John Stuart Mill's version of utilitarian
liberalism (Kant 1785/1983, Mill 1859/1975, ch. III). Examination of
the concept of autonomy also figures centrally in debates over
education policy, biomedical ethics, various legal freedoms and rights
(such as freedom of speech and the right to privacy), as well as moral
and political theory more broadly. In the realm of moral theory,
seeing autonomy as a central value can be contrasted with alternative
frameworks such an ethic of care, utilitarianism of some kinds, and an
ethic of virtue. Autonomy has traditionally been thought to connote
independence and hence to reflect assumptions of individualism in both
moral thinking and political designations of political status.  In
recent decades, however, theorists have increasingly tried to
structure the concept so as to sever its ties to this brand of
individualism.  In all such discussions the concept of autonomy is the
focus of much controversy and debate, disputes which focus attention
on the fundamentals of moral and political philosophy and the

Ibn Rushd's Natural Philosophy,0.6315242648124695,0.14865626394748688,"

Philosophy has been divided into theoretical and practical since the
time of Aristotle’s distinction of the sciences, and within
theoretical philosophy, the enquire on nature was of major import in
Ancient and Medieval times. Most of its contents later developed into
modern natural science as the seeds of physics or chemistry, but its
founding concepts are still worth reflecting upon. Concepts such as
those of body and extension, motion and change, time and place,
finiteness and infiniteness, and of nature itself have kept their
philosophical gist.

The Iranian philosopher Ibn Sina [Avicenna] (d. 1037 CE) organized his
philosophical encyclopedia “The Healing” in four sections:
Logic, mathematical, and natural sciences, and sciences of the Divine;
the doctrine on the human soul was part of the natural sciences. The
Andalusian Ibn Rushd [Averroes] (d. 1198 CE) was a faithful disciple
of Aristotle and he stuck to the organization of the Aristotelian
corpus implemented by Andronicus of Rhodes (fl. 1st century BCE), a
scholar of the Peripatetic school who gave the science of the soul a
place of its own, as would Averroes. On the Soul belongs to
the physical works, but it is devoted to living natural beings with
considerable focus on humans and their capacities for sensation and
thought, and Andronicus placed it after the first four physical
treatises and before metaphysics. The mentioned treatises are the
Physics, On the Heavens, On Generation and
Corruption, and the Meteorology.

We may say that the Physics, which is the first and the
longest treatise on natural philosophy (184a–267b in
Bekker’s numbering) contains a number of Aristotelian books that
deal with key issues of this science, but Averroes was not aware of
this fact that modern research has brought to light. His work was
based on the belief in the unity of the treatise, so that he always
strove for a coherent, unified reading and interpretation of
Aristotle.

Averroes composed Long, Middle, and Short commentaries on
Aristotle’s Physics and some essays,
masā’il, quaestiones, on physical
matters. The Middle and Short commentaries were revised by Averroes
himself, and the Long Commentary shows traces of revision, but in
general, the Long Commentary represents the last stage of his thought.
The Middle Commentaries were favored by later Jewish philosophers,
but, as S. Harvey has shown, the Long Commentary on
the Physics was soon translated into Hebrew and also drew
their interest (Harvey 1985). The Long Commentary was the most
influential of the three in the Latin West and a recent collective
publication highlights its influence in the field of natural
philosophy (Bakker 2015). For this reason the research for this
article will rely mainly on it, but occasional references to the other
commentaries, or to other works, will be made.

A prolific poet and the author of the Fons Vitae, Ibn Gabirol
is well known in the history of philosophy for the doctrine that all
things —including soul and intellect—are comprised of
matter and form (“Universal Hylomorphism”), and for his
emphasis on Divine Will. Ibn Gabirol is moved first and foremost by
the Neoplatonic theological sense that God's reality infuses all
things, and by the concomitant ethical and existential ideal of
Neoplatonic Return—the notion that we must strive, through mind
and deed, to reclaim our own truest being and likeness to our
source. Thought wrongly by centuries of Christian scholastics to be
either a Christian defender of Augustine or a Muslim misreader of
Aristotle, Ibn Gabirol is in fact a Jewish Neoplatonist who, under the
additional influence of Pseudo Empedoclean ideas, paints for us a
modified Plotinian universe in which all things are rooted in various
“layers” of matters and forms which reveal the mediating
graces of God's own Will/Wisdom/Word. For Ibn Gabirol, everything
(even the simple unity of intellect itself) reveals a matter+form
complexity, mirroring in this way the complex unity of God's own
“essential” and “active” moments. Where God
reveals himself as the “Fountain of Life,” our material
core acts as the river through which we may return always to our
source.

Abū-ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn ibn-ʿAbdallāh
Ibn-Sīnā [Avicenna] (ca. 970–1037) was the preeminent
philosopher and physician of the Islamic
 world.[1]
In his work he combined the disparate strands of 
 philosophical/scientific[2] 
 thinking in Greek late antiquity and early
Islam into a rationally rigorous and self-consistent scientific system
that encompassed and explained all reality, including the tenets of
revealed religion and its theological and mystical elaborations. In
its integral and comprehensive articulation of science and philosophy,
it represents the culmination of the Hellenic tradition, defunct in
Greek after the sixth century, reborn in Arabic in the 9th
(Gutas 2004a, 2010). It dominated intellectual life in the Islamic
world for centuries to come, and the sundry reactions to it, ranging
from acceptance to revision to refutation and to substitution with
paraphilosophical constructs, determined developments in philosophy,
science, religion, theology, and mysticism. In Latin translation,
beginning with the 12th century, Avicenna’s
philosophy influenced mightily the medieval and Renaissance
philosophers and scholars, just as the Latin translation of his
medical Canon (GMed 1), often revised, formed the basis of
medical instruction in European universities until the 17th
century. The Arabophone Jewish and Christian scholars within Islam, to
the extent that they were writing for their respective communities and
not as members of the Islamic commonwealth, accepted most of his ideas
(notably Maimonides in his Arabic Guide of the Perplexed and
Barhebraeus in his Syriac Cream of Wisdom). The Jewish
communities in Europe used Hebrew translations of some of his works,
though they were far less receptive than their Roman Catholic
counterparts, preferring Averroes instead. The Roman Orthodox in
Constantinople were quite indifferent to philosophical developments
abroad (and inimical to those at home) and came to know
Avicenna’s name only through its occurrence in the Greek
translations of the Latin scholastics that began after the
4th Crusade. In his influence on the intellectual history
of the world in the West (of India), he is second only to Aristotle,
as it was intuitively acknowledged in the Islamic world where he is

Ibn Sina's Logic,0.6203662753105164,0.12528298795223236,"

Ibn Sīnā [hereafter: Avicenna] (980–1037 CE) is—directly
or indirectly—the most influential logician in the Arabic
tradition. His work is central in the re-definition of a family of
problems and doctrines inherited from ancient and late ancient logic,
especially Aristotle and the Peripatetic tradition. While, in general
terms, Avicenna squarely falls into a logical tradition that it is
reasonable to characterize as Aristotelian, the trove of innovations
he introduces establishes him as a genuinely new canonical figure. Every
later logician in this tradition confronts him, either as a critic or
as a follower, to the extent that, with few exceptions, Aristotle and
the Peripatetic tradition almost entirely disappear from the
scene. Arabic logic accordingly divides into two areas and periods:
pre-Avicennan and post-Avicennan (Street
2004).[1]

The innovations introduced by Avicenna include systematic as well as
technical points: from the division of logic into its main areas to
the reading of propositions and the understanding of modality; from a
new account of hypothetical propositions to his theory of
demonstration.

This entry aims to offer an account of some of the most representative
features of Avicenna’s logic without any pretense to
exhaustiveness. A standard classification of the works and contents of
the Aristotelian Organon in the Arabic tradition (which
includes Porphyry’s Isagoge, alongside
Aristotle’s Rhetoric and Poetics) divides
the study of logic broadly into two main areas focusing either on (i)
formal aspects (e.g., the analysis of the truth conditions of
propositions, inference, and the structure of arguments) or (ii) on
material aspects (e.g., the classification of arguments with
respect to their terms and premises, which underwrites a standard
division of logic into five areas: demonstration, dialectic,
sophistic, rhetoric, and poetics). The entry focuses primarily on (i)
and limits the treatment of (ii) to the case of demonstration and
fallacies.

Ibn Sina's Metaphysics,0.6110575199127197,0.1272558718919754,"
For Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā) metaphysics is a science
(ʿilm), i.e., a perfectly rationally established
discipline that allows human reason to achieve an authentic
understanding of the inner structure of the world. Metaphysics is the
science of being qua being and therefore the science that
explains every being. In his interpretation, Avicenna fuses
the Aristotelian tradition, which he intends to renew (Gutas 2014),
with the Neo-Platonic idea of emanation, on which he builds his
system: metaphysics thus includes theology, cosmology and angelology,
and provides a foundation for physics, psychology, prophetology and
eschatology. Indeed, metaphysics even demonstrates “the
principles of the particular sciences” that investigate
“the states of particular existent things”
(Ilāhiyyāt, I, 2, 14, 18–15, 7) and are
subordinate to it (Bertolacci 2006: Ch. 7). So metaphysics is
“first” and “at the head” of all sciences
(Ilāhiyyāt, I, 3, 18, 14–17; Houser 1999;
Lizzini 2005) and is universal not only because it concerns
being qua being (instead of just some aspects of it), but
also because it comprehends reality—and the system of knowledge
this implies—as a whole (instead of just some portions of
it).
 In this article, which has reference mainly, but not exclusively,
 to the Ilāhiyyāt
 of Kitāb al-Šifā' (known in English as
 the Metaphysics of the Book of the Healing or of
 the Book of the Cure), I shall start—after introducing
 Avicenna's sources—with a brief discussion of the status of
 metaphysics as a science, and then illustrate Avicenna's analysis of
 existence and the theology that arises from it. Thereafter I shall
 focus on Avicenna's theory of emanation, highlighting its essential
 aspects.

Ibn Sina's Natural Philosophy,0.6180675625801086,0.13784995675086975,"

Ibn Sīnā (980–1037)—the Avicenna of Latin
fame—is arguably the most important representative of
falsafa, the Graeco-Arabic philosophical tradition beginning
with Plato and Aristotle, extending through the Neoplatonic commentary
tradition and continuing among philosophers and scientists in the
medieval Arabic world. Avicenna's fame in many ways is a result of his
ability to synthesize and to extend the many intellectual trends of
his time. These trends included not only the aforementioned Greek
traditions, but also the Islamic theological tradition, Kalām,
which was emerging at the same time that the Greek scientific and
philosophical texts were being translated into Arabic. Avicenna's own
unique system survives in no fewer than three philosophical
encyclopedias—Cure (or The Healing), The
Salvation and Pointers and Reminders. Each provides a
comprehensive worldview ranging from logic to psychology, from
metaphysics to ethics (although admittedly, ethics is treated only
scantly). At the middle of this Avicennan worldview is natural
philosophy or physics (ʿilm ṭabīʿī).
The significance of natural philosophy, Avicenna's physics in
particular, is twofold. First, it represents Avicenna's best attempt
to explain the sensible world in which we live and to provide the
principles for many of the other special sciences. Second, Avicenna's
natural philosophy lays the foundations for a full understanding of
his advancements in other fields. Examples of this second point
include, but are certainly not limited to, the ramifications of
logical distinctions for the sciences, the physical basis of
psychology (as well as the limitation of physicalism for a philosophy
of mind) and the introduction of key problems that would become the
focal points of metaphysical inquiry. In all cases, Avicenna assumes
his readers know their physics. 

As others before him, Avicenna understands natural philosophy as the
study of body insofar as it is subject to motion. Thus the present
study, after an overview of medieval physics generally, turns to
Avicenna's account of the nature of body followed by his account of
motion. Central to an account of bodies is whether they are continuous
or atomic, and so one must consider Avicenna's critique of atomism and
his defense and analysis of continuous magnitudes. The discussion of
motion follows in two steps: one, his account of motion and, two, his
account of the conditions for motion. The section on motion
concentrates on Avicenna's unique understanding of the Aristotelian
definition of motion as the first actuality of potential as potential,
while the conditions for motion involve his understanding of time and
place.

We are aware of our bodies. I see the world by opening my eyes and
in so doing, I feel the motion of my eyelid. I feel that my legs are
crossed and that my arm is raising. I feel tired and thirsty. I feel
cold. I feel my teeth begin to chatter. My back itches. The way we
relate to our body, including the way we perceive it, control it and
affectively react to what happens to it, is unlike the way we relate to
other objects.


Despite its richness, bodily awareness has attracted relatively little
attention from philosophers with the notable exception of
phenomenologists. Neuropsychologists and psychiatrists, however, have
confronted the multi-faceted phenomenology of bodily awareness through
a wide variety of disorders. In addition, the study of the body is now
crucial in cognitive neuroscience. Bodily illusions have raised a wide
range of philosophical questions about the underlying mechanisms of
bodily self-awareness. The notion of bodily awareness is at the crossroads of philosophical
debates on the self, perception, action and space. This entry will
focus on three main questions: (i) How does the awareness of one's body
differ from the awareness of other objects? (ii) What are the roles of
action and mental representations of the body for bodily
awareness? (iii) What makes us feel our body as our own?

Alfred Jules Ayer,0.655369758605957,0.5994783043861389,"


A.J. Ayer (1910–1989) was only 24 when he wrote the book that made his
philosophical name, Language, Truth, and Logic (hereafter
LTL), published in 1936. In it he put forward what were
understood to be the major theses of logical positivism, and so
established himself as the leading English representative of the
movement, Viennese in origin. In endorsing these views Ayer saw
himself as continuing in the line of British empiricism established by
John Locke and David Hume, an empiricism whose most recent
representative was Bertrand Russell. Throughout his subsequent career
he remained true to this tradition’s rejection of the
possibility of synthetic a priori knowledge, and so he saw
the method of philosophy to be the analysis of the meaning of key
terms, such as ‘causality’, ‘truth’,
‘knowledge’, ‘freedom’, and so on. The major
portion of his work was devoted to exploring different facets of our
claims to knowledge, particularly perceptual knowledge and knowledge
that depended on inductive inference for its credence. Along the way
he defended a ‘justified true belief’ account of
knowledge, a Humean account of causation, and compatibilism with
respect to freedom.  In
LTL he put forward an emotivist theory of ethics, one that he
never abandoned.

Ayer always wrote with stylish crispness and clarity; he could lay
bare the bones of a philosophical difficulty in a few paragraphs of
strikingly simple prose. On many a philosophical problem Ayer cannot
be bettered for providing a lucid, informative, and revealing
description of its contours. Above all, on reading an essay of his,
whether it be on basic propositions, sense data, induction, or
freedom, one comes away recognizing that the aim of the author has
been to reach the truth, no matter what that turned out to be.
Unfortunately, he sometimes rushed to reach it, which, together with
the directness of his style, gave him a reputation for mere cleverness
that he never lived down. Nevertheless, amongst British philosophers
of the 20th Century he has been ranked as second only to
Russell (Foster 1985); P.F. Strawson, at his memorial service, stated
that his contribution to the theory of knowledge and general
metaphysics was “in no way inferior to Russell’s”
(see Rogers 1999, 358).

Francis Bacon,0.7586593627929688,0.22440840303897847,"


Francis Bacon (1561–1626) was one of the leading figures in
natural philosophy and in the field of scientific methodology in the
period of transition from the Renaissance to the early modern era. As a
lawyer, member of Parliament, and Queen's Counsel, Bacon wrote on
questions of law, state and religion, as well as on contemporary
politics; but he also published texts in which he speculated on
possible conceptions of society, and he pondered questions of ethics
(Essays) even in his works on natural philosophy (The
Advancement of Learning).


After his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge and Gray's
Inn, London, Bacon did not take up a post at a university, but instead
tried to start a political career. Although his efforts were not
crowned with success during the era of Queen Elizabeth, under James I
he rose to the highest political office, Lord Chancellor. Bacon's
international fame and influence spread during his last years, when he
was able to focus his energies exclusively on his philosophical work,
and even more so after his death, when English scientists of the Boyle
circle (Invisible College) took up his idea of a cooperative
research institution in their plans and preparations for establishing
the Royal Society.


To the present day Bacon is well known for his treatises on
empiricist natural philosophy (The Advancement of Learning,
Novum Organum Scientiarum) and for his doctrine of the idols,
which he put forward in his early writings, as well as for the idea of
a modern research institute, which he described in Nova
Atlantis.

Roger Bacon,0.7584238052368164,0.22292621433734894,"
Roger Bacon (1214/1220–1292), Master of Arts, contemporary of
Robert Kilwardby, Peter of Spain, and Albert the Great at the
University of Paris in the 1240s, was one of the early Masters who
taught Aristotle's works on natural philosophy and
metaphysics. Sometime after 1248–49, he became an independent
scholar with an interest in languages and experimental-scientific
concerns. Between 1247 and 1267, Bacon mastered most of the Greek and
Arabic texts on the science of optics. In 1256/57, either at Paris or
Oxford, he joined the Franciscan Order. By 1264 in Paris, he came to
believe that his university reputation for advanced learning had
suffered. Because he regarded this decade as an exile from university
teaching and writing, he sought the Patronage of Cardinal Guy le Gros
de Foulque, Papal Ambassador to England (who later served as Pope
Clement IV, 1265-68). On the instruction of the Pope on June 22, 1266,
Bacon quickly wrote “an introductory work,” the Opus
maius, and the related works, Opus minus and Opus
tertium. He set out his own new model for a reform of the system
of philosophical and theological studies, one that would incorporate
language studies and science studies, then unavailable at the
universities. In this project, he was partly successful. He wrote a
new and provocative text on semiotics, and influenced the addition
of perspectiva to mathematical studies (the Quadrivium)
as a required university subject. He succeeded in setting out a model
of an experimental science on the basis of his study of optics. The
latter was used in his extension of experimental science to include
new medicines and the general health care of the body. He did this in
a new context: the application of linguistic and scientific knowledge
for a better understanding of Theology and in the service of
the Res publica Christiana. Heretofore, it appeared that Bacon
was condemned by his own Order in 1278 “on account of certain
suspected novelties.” This may have been due to his interests in
astrology and alchemy. The historical accuracy of this condemnation
has been questioned by some Bacon scholars, and it is now seen by some
as a later retrojection. Bonaventure and John Pecham were among his
first readers. It is clear that with the possible exception of the
uses or astrology and alchemy, Bacon shared in Bonaventure's project
seeking a “reduction” of the sciences to theology. Bacon
also found a sympathetic reader and interpreter in the great secular
scholar of the Sorbonne, Peter of Limoges (d. 1306). Through the
latter, Bacon may have influenced Raymond Lull. Sometime in the late
1270s or early 1280s, Bacon returned to Oxford, where he completed his
edition with introduction and notes of the Secretum secretorum,
a Latin translation of an Arabic text on the education of the Prince,
the Sirr-al-‘asrar, which he believed to be a work by Aristotle
written for Alexander the Great. This work of advice to the Prince
points to Bacon's close connections to the Papal Court through Pope
Clement IV, the French Court through Alphonse of Poitiers, and the
English Court. His contacts with the Papal Curia were mediated by
William Bonecor, Ambassador of King Henry III. Bacon died at Oxford
c. 1292.

The Epistemic Basing Relation,0.7194083333015442,0.7585315108299255,"


The epistemic basing relation is the relation which holds between a
reason and a belief if and only if the reason is a reason for which
the belief is held. It is generally thought to be a necessary, but
not sufficient, condition for a belief’s being justified that
the belief be based on a reason. The basing relation is what
distinguishes good reasons which a person possesses that contribute
to the personal justification of a given belief from good reasons
which the person possesses but that do not contribute to the personal
justification of the belief.


 Basing relations may be involved in both inferential and
non-inferential justification. For example, one may hold that sensory
states count as reasons, and thus require that a sensory belief be
based on a reason if it is to be justified by that reason. In
addition, one might understand at least some self-evident beliefs to
be based on the meanings of the various terms of the sentence
expressing the proposition believed.  For example, one’s belief
that all bachelors are unmarried men may be understood to be based on
the meanings of ‘all’, ‘bachelors’,
‘are’, etc.

 The basing relation is most frequently analyzed in terms of a
reason’s causing a
 belief.[1]
 In such analyses, the reason and the belief are understood to be
mental states of a person. The cause may be a contributing cause or a
sufficient cause. However, the basing relation has also been analyzed
as an appropriate counterfactual cause of a belief and also as
depending on an appropriate meta-belief to the effect that a reason
is a good reason to hold the belief.


Analysis of the basing relation is relevant to a variety of
fundamental epistemological issues. It is relevant to the nature of
epistemic rationalization and to questions regarding the
internalism/externalism debate. In addition, it has been argued that
reliabilist theories of justification are incompatible with the
correct analysis of the basing relation.

French theorist Jean Baudrillard (1929–2007) was one of the
foremost intellectual figures of the present age whose work combines
philosophy, social theory, and an idiosyncratic cultural metaphysics
that reflects on key events of phenomena of the epoch. A sharp critic
of contemporary society, culture, and thought, Baudrillard is often
seen as a major guru of French postmodern theory, although he can also
be read as a thinker who combines social theory and philosophy in
original and provocative ways and a writer who has developed his own
style and forms of writing. He was an extremely prolific author who has
published over thirty books and commented on some of the most salient
cultural and sociological phenomena of the contemporary era, including
the erasure of the distinctions of gender, race, and class that
structured modern societies in a new postmodern consumer, media, and
high tech society; the mutating roles of art and aesthetics;
fundamental changes in politics, culture, and human beings; and the
impact of new media, information, and cybernetic technologies in the
creation of a qualitatively different social order, providing
fundamental mutations of human and social life.  

 For some years a cult figure of postmodern theory, Baudrillard moved
beyond the postmodern discourse from the early 1980s to the
present, and has developed a highly idiosyncratic mode of
philosophical and cultural analysis. This entry focuses on the
development of Baudrillard's unique modes of thought and how he moved
from social theory to postmodern theory to a provocative type of
philosophical
 analysis.[1]
 In retrospect, Baudrillard can be seen a theorist who has traced in
original ways the life of signs and impact of technology on social
life, and who has systematically criticized major modes of modern
thought, while developing his own philosophical perspectives.

historian, and theologian. His career falls into two main phases,
divided by the Revolutions of 1848.  In the 1840s, the period known as
the Vormärz or the prelude to the German revolutions of March
1848, Bauer was a leader of the Left-Hegelian movement, developing a
republican interpretation of Hegel, which combined ethical and
aesthetic motifs. His theory of infinite self-consciousness, derived
from Hegel’s account of subjective spirit, stressed rational autonomy
and historical progress.  Investigating the textual sources of
Christianity, Bauer described religion as a form of alienation, which,
because of the deficiencies of earthly life, projected irrational,
transcendent powers over the self, while sanctioning particularistic
sectarian and material interests. He criticized the Restoration state,
its social and juridical base, and its orthodox religious
ideology. Analyzing the emergence of modern mass society, he rejected
liberalism for its inconsequent opposition to the existing order, and
for its equation of freedom with property, but he accused socialism of
an inadequate appreciation of individual autonomy.  After the defeats
of 1848, Bauer repudiated Hegel. He predicted a general crisis of
European civilization, caused by the exhaustion of philosophy and the
failure of liberal and revolutionary politics. New prospects of
liberation would, he believed, issue from the crisis. His late
writings examined the emergence of Russia as a world power, opening an
era of global imperialism and war. These writings influenced
Nietzsche’s thinking on cultural renewal. Friedrich Engels and Karl
Kautsky claimed Bauer’s religious criticism for the socialist
movement, while the anti-traditionalist conservatism of his late work
influenced the thought of Carl Schmitt in the twentieth century.

on conditional probabilities in their theories of evidence and their
models of empirical learning.  Bayes' Theorem is central to these

probabilities and because it clarifies significant features of

The nature of beauty is one of the most enduring and controversial
themes in Western philosophy, and is—with the nature of
art—one of the two fundamental issues in philosophical
aesthetics. Beauty has traditionally been counted among the ultimate
values, with goodness, truth, and justice. It is a primary theme among
ancient Greek, Hellenistic, and medieval philosophers, and was central
to eighteenth and nineteenth-century thought, as represented in
treatments by such thinkers as Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Hume, Burke,
Kant, Schiller, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Hanslick, and Santayana. By the
beginning of the twentieth century, beauty was in decline as a subject
of philosophical inquiry, and also as a primary goal of the arts.
However, there were signs of revived interest by the early 2000s.

There are some thinkers who are, from the very beginning,
unambiguously identified as philosophers (e.g., Plato). There are
others whose philosophical place is forever contested (e.g.,
Nietzsche); and there are those who have gradually won the right to be
admitted into the philosophical fold. Simone de Beauvoir is one of
these belatedly acknowledged philosophers. Identifying herself as an
author rather than as a philosopher and calling herself the midwife of
Sartre’s existential ethics rather than a thinker in her own right,
Beauvoir’s place in philosophy had to be won against her word. That
place is now uncontested. The international conference celebrating the
centennial of Beauvoir’s birth organized by Julia Kristeva is one of
the more visible signs of Beauvoir’s growing influence and status. Her
enduring contributions to the fields of ethics, politics,
existentialism, phenomenology and feminist theory and her significance
as an activist and public intellectual is now a matter of record.
Unlike her status as a philosopher, Simone de Beauvoir’s position as a
feminist theorist has never been in question. Controversial from the
beginning, The Second Sex’s critique of patriarchy continues
to challenge social, political and religious categories used to
justify women’s inferior status. Though readers of the English
translation of The Second Sex have never had trouble
understanding the feminist significance of its analysis of patriarchy,
they might be forgiven for missing its philosophical importance so
long as they had to rely on an arbitrarily abridged version of The
Second Sex that was questionably translated by a zoologist who
was deaf to the philosophical meanings and nuances of Beauvoir’s
French terms. The 2010 translation of The Second Sex changed
that. In addition to providing the full text, this translation’s
sensitivity to the philosophical valence of Beauvoir’s writing makes
it possible for her English readers to understand the
existential-phenomenological grounds of her feminist analysis of the
forces that subordinate women to men and designate her as the
Other.

scientists who call themselves behaviorists wish to dissociate

This distinction can be explicated using the instantiation relation. My
cat instantiates the property of being hungry, as that is a way he is,
and, being an individual, is not himself instantiated by anything.
While properties also instantiate—the property of being red, for
example, has the property of being a color—only properties are
instantiated; individuals only instantiate. So, our first question is
whether existence is instantiated and, if so, whether it is
instantiated by individuals like Obama, my chair, and the fig tree in
my backyard. Do individuals, in addition to ordinary properties like
being human, being comfortable to sit in, and needing more water,
instantiate a property expressed by the English verb
‘exists’? 


There is a debate in the literature on properties between the abundant
conception of properties, according to which there is a property
corresponding to every natural language predicate and, more generally,
every class of individuals, and the sparse conception of properties,
according to which a predicate expresses a property only if the
objects that predicate is true of resemble one another in an intrinsic
way. If the abundant conception is true, then our first question may
seem trivial: Existence is a property of individuals because sentences
like ‘Bill Gates exists’ are grammatical and there is a
class of all individuals and hence a corresponding property of
existing. It seems, then, that our first question has bite only if the
sparse conception is true. But appearances deceive. As we will see in
section 1, there is a controversy as to whether the logical form of a
sentence like ‘Bill Gates exists’ is really
subject-predicate in structure and so whether the English verb
‘exists’ really is predicated of individuals. The question
whether existence is a property of individuals is perhaps more
straightforward on the sparse conception of properties. But the
question can still be raised even on the abundant conception as the
question whether existence is a property of individuals involved in
our talk of what exists and what does not, which is then a question
about the logical form of the sentences used in our existential
discourse. 


We can trace the issue of whether existence is a property to a
disagreement between the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle and some
of his medieval followers over the relationship between an
individual's essence and its existence. The debate requires some
background. We begin with the distinction between accident and essence
and that distinction's relation to contingency and necessity. Some of
a thing's properties are contingent, in the sense that the thing might
not have had them. I am writing right now, but I might have been out
for a run instead. So working on a paper right now is one of my
contingent properties. Contingent properties contrast with necessary
properties. I am necessarily human, in the sense that it is impossible
that I am a nonhuman. All contingent properties are accidents and all
essences are necessary but, according to the Aristotelian, some
necessary properties are accidents. A thing's essential properties are
inseparable from the bearer, not only in the sense that the property
is necessarily had by that object but in the deeper sense that any
adequate account of what that object is involves that property; they
are part of any adequate definition of the thing or answer to the
question ‘What is it?’. I am essentially a human and
perhaps essentially the person I in fact am, if there are individual
essences in addition to general essences. I am necessarily identical
to something and necessarily such that 2+2=4, but these properties are
among my accidents, as they are not part of any adequate account of
what I am and what distinguishes me from others. While this
distinction between a thing's necessary properties and its essential
properties is controversial, there is no doubt that it was Aristotle's
view, shared by most of his medieval followers, and so informed the
first historical occurrence of the debate about existence under
discussion. Aristotle seems to have seen nothing more to existence
than essence; there is not a space between an articulation of what a
thing is and that thing's existing. Saint Thomas Aquinas, on the other
hand, famously distinguished a thing's essence from its
existence. Aquinas argued something as follows, in chapter 4 of
his On Being and Essence. One can have an understanding of
what a man or a phoenix is without knowing whether it exists. So,
existence is something in addition to essence. In short, Aquinas
argued that existence is a separate property as existence is not part
of most objects's natures and so those objects can be conceived or
thought of separately from their existing.


There is a long and distinguished line of philosophers, including
David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Gottlob Frege, and Bertrand Russell, who
followed Aristotle in denying that existence is a property of
individuals, even as they rejected other aspects of Aristotle's
views. Hume argued (in A Treatise of Human Nature 1.2.6) that
there is no impression of existence distinct from the impression of an
object, which is ultimately on Hume's view a bundle of qualities.
As all of our contentful ideas derive from impressions, Hume concluded
that existence is not a separate property of an object. Kant's
criticism of the ontological arguments for the existence of God rested
on a rejection of the claim that existence is a property of an object.
Proponents of the ontological argument argue that the concept of God as
an entity with all perfections or a being of which no greater can be
conceived entails God's existence, as existence is a perfection
and a being that exists is greater than a being that does not exist.
Kant objected (in his Critique of Pure Reason,
A596/B624-A602/B630) that existence is not a property. “Thus when
I think a thing, through whichever and however many predicates I like
(even in its thoroughgoing determination), not the least bit gets added
to the thing when I posit in addition that this thing is. For otherwise
what would exist would not be the same as what I had thought in my
concept, but more than that, and I could not say that the very object
of my concept exists” (A600/B628). Finally, both Frege and
Russell maintained that existence is not a property of individuals but
instead a second-order property—a property of concepts, for Frege,
and of propositional functions, for Russell. Crudely, to say that
dinosaurs do not exist is to say that the property of being a dinosaur
is not instantiated; to say that Jean-Baptiste Botul does not exist is
to say that some property—say, the property of being a unique
post-war critic of Kant and father of Butolism—is not instantiated.
In neither case is it to say of some individual that it does not exist,
which neither Frege nor Russell thought made sense.


The view that existence is not a property of individuals became the
common view in the early 20th Century. While Aristotle, Hume, and
Kant's related reasons for the thesis have persuaded some, the
dominant force behind this agreement is the thought, developed most
forcefully in [Russell 1905b], that denying that existence is a
first-order property is the only way to avoid the consequence that
there are things that do not exist and thus that there is a
distinction between being and existing, our second framing question
from above. The thesis that there are things that do not exist was
held by the Austrian philosopher Alexius Meinong. Existence is a
genuine property of individuals, Meinong maintained, but not
universally had. While there are many ways to motivate Meinongianism,
a primary motivation is the puzzle of negative singular
existentials—sentences that seem to truly assert the
nonexistence of an individual, such as the sentence
‘Jean-Baptiste Botul does not exist’. In order to be true,
it seems, the subject position must designate some entity of which
nonexistence is truly predicated, in which case there are
things—the designation of these singular terms—that do not
exist. Frege and Russell, by contrast, take the same sentences to
demonstrate that those expressions are not genuine singular terms at
all and that negative existentials all have a general form, asserting
the noninstantiation of a property. In the following section I discuss
Frege and Russell's account of true negative existentials. In the
second section I discuss Meinongianism, comparing the account of true
negative existentials on offer by the Meinongian with the Russellian
account discussed in the first section. The article ends with a
discussion of an anti-Meinongian account according to which existence
is a universal property of individuals and a discussion of the related
issues of existence in the context of quantified tense and modal
logics.

What is time, and is it real? If it is, does time flow or lapse or
pass? Are the future or the past as real as the present? These
metaphysical questions have been debated for more than two millennia,
with no resolution in sight. Modern physics provides us, however, with
tools that enable us to sharpen these old questions and generate new
arguments. Does the special theory of relativity, for example, show
that there is no temporal passage or that the future is as real as the
present? The focus of this entry will be on these new insights into
those old questions.

Belief,0.7257234454154968,0.7590994238853455,"
 Contemporary analytic philosophers of mind generally use the term
“belief” to refer to the attitude we have, roughly,
whenever we take something to be the case or regard it as true. To
believe something, in this sense, needn't involve actively reflecting
on it: Of the vast number of things ordinary adults believe, only a
few can be at the fore of the mind at any single time. Nor does the
term “belief”, in standard philosophical usage, imply any
uncertainty or any extended reflection about the matter in question
(as it sometimes does in ordinary English usage). Many of the things
we believe, in the relevant sense, are quite mundane: that we have
heads, that it's the 21st century, that a coffee mug is on the desk.
Forming beliefs is thus one of the most basic and important features
of the mind, and the concept of belief plays a crucial role in both
philosophy of mind and epistemology. The “mind-body
problem”, for example, so central to philosophy of mind, is in
part the question of whether and how a purely physical organism can
have beliefs. Much of epistemology revolves around questions about
when and how our beliefs are justified or qualify as knowledge.


Most contemporary philosophers characterize belief as a
“propositional attitude”. Propositions
 are generally taken to be whatever it is that sentences express
 (see the entry on
 propositions). For example, 
 if two sentences mean the same thing (e.g., “snow is white” in
English, “Schnee ist weiss” in German), they express the same
proposition, and if two sentences differ in meaning, they express
different propositions. (Here we are setting aside some 
complications about that might arise in connection with indexicals;
see the entry on
 indexicals.)
 A propositional attitude, then, is the mental state of
having some attitude, stance, take, or opinion about a proposition or
about the potential state of affairs in which that proposition is
true—a mental state of the sort canonically expressible in the
form “S A that P”, where S picks
out the individual possessing the mental state, A picks out
the attitude, and P is a sentence expressing a
proposition. For example: Ahmed [the subject] hopes [the attitude]
that Alpha Centauri hosts intelligent life [the proposition], or
Yifeng [the subject] doubts [the attitude] that New York City will
exist in four hundred years. What one person doubts or hopes, another
might fear, or believe, or desire, or intend—different
attitudes, all toward the same proposition. Contemporary discussions
of belief are often embedded in more general discussions of the
propositional attitudes; and treatments of the propositional attitudes
often take belief as the first and foremost example.

The Ethics of Belief,0.71310955286026,0.7744421958923341,"

The “ethics of belief” refers to a cluster of questions at
the intersection of epistemology, ethics, philosophy of mind, and
psychology.

The central question in the debate is whether there are norms of some
sort governing our habits of belief-formation, belief-maintenance, and
belief-relinquishment. Is it ever or always morally wrong (or
epistemically irrational, or practically imprudent)
to hold a belief on insufficient evidence? Is it ever or always
morally right (or epistemically rational, or
practically prudent) to believe on the basis of sufficient
evidence, or to withhold belief in the perceived absence of it? Is it
ever or always obligatory to seek out all available epistemic evidence
for a belief? Are there some ways of obtaining evidence that are
themselves immoral, irrational, imprudent?

Related questions have to do with the nature and structure of the
norms involved, if any, as well as the source of their authority. Are
they instrumental norms grounded in contingent ends that we set for
ourselves? Are they categorical norms grounded in ends set for us by
the very nature of our intellectual or moral capacities? Are there
other options? And what are the objects of evaluation in this
context—believers, beliefs, or both?

Finally, assuming that there are norms of some sort governing
belief-formation, what does that imply about the nature of belief?
Does it imply that belief-formation is voluntary or under our control?
If so, what sort of control is this? If not, then is talk of an
ethics of belief even coherent?

Belief Merging and Judgment Aggregation,0.6970903277397156,0.9108309149742126,"
Groups often need to reach decisions and decisions can be complex,
involving the assessment of several related issues. For example, in a
university a hiring committee typically decides on a candidate on the
basis of her teaching and research qualities. A city council
confronted with the decision of building a bridge, may ask its members
to state whether they are favorable or not and, at the same time, to
provide reasons for their position (like economical and environmental
impacts, or expenditure considerations). Lastly, jurors are required
to decide on the liability of a defendant by expressing their
judgments on the conditions prescribed by the relevant code of law for
the case at hand.  As pointed out by Kornhauser and Sager (1986)
referring to real jury trials, the aggregation of individual opinions
on logically interrelated propositions can lead to a paradoxical
result, the so-called doctrinal paradox. Inspired by the
doctrinal paradox in jurisprudence, the problem of judgment
aggregation attracted the interest of political scientists,
philosophers, logicians, economists and computer scientists. Links to
social choice theory have shown that, similar to the problem of
preference aggregation (Arrow 1951/1963; Sen 1970), a judgment
aggregation procedure that satisfies a number of desirable properties
does not exist.
The question judgment aggregation addresses is how we can define
aggregation procedures that preserve individual rationality at the
collective level. From a philosophical point of view, such question
concerns the nature of group attitudes such as group beliefs (Roth
2011). When the city council decides to build the bridge, the decision
is taken on the basis of individual beliefs that, for example, the
bridge will have a positive impact on the development of the economic
activities in the area and does not represent an environmental
threat. Thus, the formal approach to judgment aggregation can serve to
cast light on the dependence between individual and collective beliefs
(if there are any). The questions tackled by judgment aggregation are
also relevant for the testimony problem investigated in social
epistemology (Goldman 1999, 2004, 2010). How shall the diverging
opinions of experts in a panel be combined and how should a rational
agent respond to such disagreement?
The problem of combining potentially conflicting pieces of
information does not arise only when a group of people needs to make a
decision. Artificial intelligence also explores ways to aggregate
conflicting sensors’ information, experts’ opinions or
databases into a consistent one (Bloch et al. 2001). The combination
of information coming from heterogeneous sensors improves the
deficiencies of the individual sensors increasing the performances of
a system. Examples are sensors of gesture recognition, screen
rotation, and accelerometer in smartphones. Distributed databases may
need to be accessed and managed at the same time to share data, for
example a hospital may need to access the data collected about
patients by different units. Internet users can find ratings on
products provided by people who have purchased and assessed them on
different online platforms. The type of information to be combined can
differ, and so its representation can be numerical or symbolic:
numbers, linguistic values, statistical probability distributions,
binary preferences, utility functions etc. Yet all examples mentioned
above deal with the problem of merging items coming from heterogeneous
sources and with the issue of managing conflicts. At a purely formal
level, belief merging studies the fusion of independent and equally
reliable sources of information expressed in propositional logic. As
with judgment aggregation, belief merging addresses the problem of
fusing several individual bases expressed in propositional logic into
a consistent one. Given the structural similarity of the problems
investigated by these two disciplines, exploring their connections can
reveal how similar these formalisms really are. On a more practical
level, the application of operators defined in belief merging to
judgment aggregation problems lead to the definition of a wider class
of aggregation operators for judgment aggregation, the
so-called distance-based procedures.
The focus of this entry is to draw explicit connections between
judgment aggregation and the belief merging literature. Judgment
aggregation will be briefly introduced in the next section. For a more
comprehensive introduction to judgment aggregation the reader is
referred to (List 2013; Grossi and Pigozzi 2014).

Bell's Theorem,0.9308009147644044,0.3367002308368683,"


Bell's Theorem is the collective name for a family of results, all
showing the impossibility of a Local Realistic interpretation of
quantum mechanics. There are variants of the Theorem with different
meanings of “Local Realistic.” In John S. Bell's pioneering
paper of 1964 the realism consisted in postulating in addition to the
quantum state a “complete state”, which determines the
results of measurements on the system, either by assigning a value to
the measured quantity that is revealed by the measurement regardless of
the details of the measurement procedure, or by enabling the system to
elicit a definite response whenever it is measured, but a response
which may depend on the macroscopic features of the experimental
arrangement or even on the complete state of the system together with
that arrangement. Locality is a condition on composite systems with
spatially separated constituents, requiring an operator which is the
product of operators associated with the individual constituents to be
assigned a value which is the product of the values assigned to the
factors, and requiring the value assigned to an operator associated
with an individual constituent to be independent of what is measured
on any other constituent. From his assumptions Bell proved an
inequality (the prototype of “Bell's Inequality”) which is
violated by the Quantum Mechanical predictions made from an entangled
state of the composite system. In other variants the complete state
assigns probabilities to the possible results of measurements of the
operators rather than determining which result will be obtained, and
nevertheless inequalities are derivable; and still other variants
dispense with inequalities. The incompatibility of Local Realistic
Theories with Quantum Mechanics permits adjudication by experiments,
some of which are described here. Most of the dozens of experiments
performed so far have favored Quantum Mechanics, but not decisively
because of the “detection loophole” or the
“communication loophole.” The latter has been nearly
decisively blocked by a recent experiment and there is a good prospect
for blocking the former. The refutation of the family of Local
Realistic Theories would imply that certain peculiarities of Quantum
Mechanics will remain part of our physical worldview: notably, the
objective indefiniteness of properties, the indeterminacy of
measurement results, and the tension between quantum nonlocality and
the locality of Relativity Theory.

The Principle of Beneficence in Applied Ethics,0.4681929647922516,0.8368696570396423,"


Beneficent actions and motives have traditionally occupied a central
place in morality. Common examples today are found in social welfare
programs, scholarships for needy and meritorious students, communal
support of health-related research, policies to improve the welfare of
animals, philanthropy, disaster relief, programs to benefit children
and the incompetent, and preferential hiring and admission policies.
What makes these diverse acts beneficent? Are such beneficent acts and
policies obligatory or merely the pursuit of optional moral ideals?


These questions have generated a substantial literature on
beneficence in both theoretical ethics and applied ethics. In
theoretical ethics, the dominant issue in recent years has been how to
place limits on the scope of beneficence. In applied and professional
ethics, a number of issues have been treated in the fields of
biomedical ethics and business ethics.

Walter Benjamin,0.6238710284233093,0.555766224861145,"

Walter Benjamin's importance as a philosopher and critical
theorist can be gauged by the diversity of his intellectual influence
and the continuing productivity of his thought. Primarily regarded as a
literary critic and essayist, the philosophical basis of
Benjamin's writings is increasingly acknowledged. They were a
decisive influence upon Theodor W. Adorno's conception of
philosophy's actuality or adequacy to the present (Adorno 1931).
In the 1930s, Benjamin's efforts to develop a politically
oriented, materialist aesthetic theory proved an important stimulus
for both the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory and the Marxist poet
and dramatist Bertolt Brecht.  

The delayed appearance of Benjamin's collected writings has determined
and sustained the Anglophone reception of his work. (A two-volume
selection was published in German in 1955, with a full edition not
appearing until 1972–89; English anthologies first appeared in
1968 and 1978; the four-volume Selected Writings,
1996–2003.) Originally received in the context of literary
theory and aesthetics, the philosophical depth and cultural breadth of
Benjamin's thought have only recently begun to be fully
appreciated. Despite the voluminous size of the secondary literature
that it has produced, his work remains a continuing source of
productivity. An understanding of the intellectual context of his work
has contributed to the philosophical revival of Early German
Romanticism. His essay on ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Its
Technical Reproducibility’ remains a major theoretical text for
film theory. One-Way Street and the work arising from his
unfinished research on nineteenth century Paris (The Arcades
Project), provide a theoretical stimulus for cultural theory and
philosophical concepts of the modern. Benjamin's messianic
understanding of history has been an enduring source of theoretical
fascination and frustration for a diverse range of philosophical
thinkers, including Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben and, in a
critical context, Jürgen Habermas. The ‘Critique of
Violence’ and ‘On the Concept of History’ are
important sources for Derrida's discussion of messianicity, which has
been influential, along with Paul de Man's discussion of allegory, for
the poststructuralist reception of Benjamin's writings. Aspects of
Benjamin's thought have also been associated with a revival of
political theology, although it is doubtful this reception is true to
the tendencies of Benjamin's own political thought. More recently,
interest in Benjamin’s philosophy of education has been fueled by the
translations of his Early Writings in 2011 and the
transcripts of his radio broadcasts for children (Radio
Benjamin) in 2014.

Jeremy Bentham,0.4921868741512298,0.6305887699127197,"


Jeremy Bentham, jurist and political reformer, is the philosopher
whose name is most closely associated with the foundational era of the
modern utilitarian tradition. Earlier moralists had enunciated several
of the core ideas and characteristic terminology of utilitarian
philosophy, most notably John Gay, Francis Hutcheson, David Hume,
Claude-Adrien Helvétius and Cesare Beccaria, but it was Bentham
who rendered the theory in its recognisably secular and systematic
form and made it a critical tool of moral and legal philosophy and
political and social improvement. In 1776, he first announced himself
to the world as a proponent of utility as the guiding principle of
conduct and law in
A Fragment on Government. In An Introduction to the
Principles of Morals and Legislation (printed 1780, published
1789), as a preliminary to developing a theory of penal law he
detailed the basic elements of classical utilitarian theory. The penal
code was to be the first in a collection of codes that would
constitute the utilitarian pannomion, a complete body of law
based on the utility principle, the development of which was to engage
Bentham in a lifetime’s work and was to include civil,
procedural, and constitutional law. As a by-product, and in the
interstices between the sub-codes of this vast legislative edifice,
Bentham’s writings ranged across ethics, ontology, logic,
political economy, judicial administration, poor law, prison reform,
international law, education, religious beliefs and institutions,
democratic theory, government, and administration. In all these areas
he made major contributions that continue to feature in discussions of
utilitarianism, notably its moral, legal, economic and political
forms. Upon this rests Bentham’s reputation as one of the great
thinkers in modern philosophy.

Henri Bergson (1859–1941) was one of the most famous and influential
French philosophers of the late 19th century-early 20th century.
Although his international fame reached cult-like heights during his
lifetime, his influence decreased notably after the second World War.
While such French thinkers as Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, and
Lévinas explicitly acknowledged his influence on their thought,
it is generally agreed that it was Gilles Deleuze's
1966 Bergsonism that marked the reawakening of interest in
Bergson's work. Deleuze realized that Bergson's most enduring
contribution to philosophical thinking is his concept of
multiplicity. Bergson's concept of multiplicity attempts to unify in a
consistent way two contradictory features: heterogeneity and
continuity. Many philosophers today think that this concept of
multiplicity, despite its difficulty, is revolutionary. It is
revolutionary because it opens the way to a reconception of community.

Human Knowledge (Principles, for short) and Three
Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous (Dialogues), are

contemporary philosophers. He was also a wide-ranging thinker with
interests in religion (which were fundamental to his philosophical
motivations), the psychology of vision, mathematics, physics, morals,

ideas. His essay Two Concepts of Liberty (1958) contributed
to a revival of interest in political theory in the English-speaking
world, and remains one of the most influential and widely discussed
texts in that field: admirers and critics agree that Berlin’s
distinction between positive and negative liberty remains, for better
or worse, a basic starting-point for theoretical discussions of the
meaning and value of political freedom. Late in his life, the greater
availability of Berlin’s numerous essays began to provoke increasing
scholarly interest in his work, and particularly in the idea of value
pluralism; that Berlin’s articulation of value pluralism contains many
ambiguities and even obscurities has only encouraged further work on
the subject by other philosophers.

Basil [Cardinal] Bessarion,0.5580061674118042,0.2389806658029557,"

Basil Bessarion (d. 1472) was, before Marsilio Ficino
(1433–1499), the not so grey eminence responsible for the return
of Plato in the Western world. Defending Plato’s reputation from
the attacks of the arch-Aristotelian George of Trebizond—attacks
which were founded in a long anti-Platonic tradition—Bessarion
introduced Christianized readings of Plato’s dialogues,
characterizing him as the pagan philosopher best suited to Roman
theology. Bessarion’s argumentative strategy not only rescued
Plato, but also opened the path to an anti-metaphysical approach to
Aristotelianism, while revealing to the Latin world a wealth of
knowledge from his Greek cultural heritage.

Implicit Bias,0.6763071417808533,0.7535824775695801,"
“Implicit bias” is a term of art referring to
relatively unconscious and relatively automatic features of prejudiced
judgment and social behavior. While psychologists in the field of
“implicit social cognition” study “implicit
attitudes” toward consumer products, self-esteem, food, alcohol,
political values, and more, the most striking and well-known research
has focused on implicit attitudes toward members of socially
stigmatized groups, such as African-Americans, women, and the LGBTQ
community.[1] For
example, imagine Frank, who explicitly believes that women and men are
equally suited for careers outside the home. Despite his explicitly
egalitarian belief, Frank might nevertheless implicitly associate
women with the home, and this implicit association might lead him to
behave in any number of biased ways, from trusting feedback from
female co-workers less to hiring equally qualified men over women.
Psychological research on implicit bias is relatively recent
(§1), but a host of metaphysical (§2), epistemological
(§3), and ethical questions (§4) about implicit bias are
pressing.[2]

‘Binarium famosissimum’ (= “most famous pair”) is
the name given by some twentieth-century historians of medieval
philosophy to what was regarded as a characteristic pair of

forms—often maintained together by members of the “Augustinian”
school of scholastics in the thirteenth century. The doctrines were
opposed by “Aristotelians” such as Thomas Aquinas. The linking of the
two theories under this name appears to be a purely recent
development, although there are conceptual connections between the
theories.

Biodiversity,0.9566861391067504,0.6067853569984436,"


“Biodiversity” is often defined as the variety of all 
forms of life, from genes to species, through to the broad scale of 
ecosystems (for a list of variants on this simple definition see
Gaston 1996). “Biodiversity” was coined as a contraction of 
“biological diversity” in 1985, but the new term arguably has taken 
on a meaning and import all its own. A symposium in 1986, and the 
follow-up book BioDiversity (Wilson 1988), edited by 
biologist E. O. Wilson, heralded the popularity of this concept. Ten 
years later, Takacs (1996, p.39) described its ascent this way: “in 
1988, biodiversity did not appear as a keyword in Biological 
Abstracts, and biological diversity appeared once. In 1993, 
biodiversity appeared seventy-two times, and biological diversity 
nineteen times”. Fifteen years further on, it would be hard to count 
how many times “biodiversity” is used every day by scientists, 
policy-makers, and others. The global importance of biodiversity now 
is reflected in the widely accepted target to achieve a significant 
reduction in the rate of loss of biodiversity by the year 2010 [see 
 2010 Biodiversity Target in Other Internet Resources].
 


While the history of this term is relatively short (compare it to 
other terms covered in this encyclopedia), it already has raised 
important, distinctive, philosophical issues. Some of these are 
entangled in the very definition of “biodiversity”, an issue treated 
in the first sections below. A challenge is the reconciliation of 
process-based and elements-based perspectives on biodiversity. 
Overall, the major issue for biodiversity is how its conservation may
be integrated with other needs of society.

Biological Information,0.9758931994438172,0.5265451073646545,"
Since the 1950s, the concept of information has acquired a
strikingly prominent role in many parts of biology. This enthusiasm
extends far beyond domains where the concept might seem to have an
obvious application, such as the biological study of perception,
cognition, and language, and now reaches into the most basic parts of
biological theory. Hormones and other cellular products through which
physiological systems are regulated are typically described as
signals.  Descriptions of how genes play their causal role in
metabolic processes and development are routinely given in terms of
“transcription”, “translation”, and
“editing”. The most general term used for the processes by
which genes exert their effects is “gene expression”. The
fates of cells in a developing organism are explained in terms of
their processing of “positional information” given to them
from surrounding cells and other factors. Many biologists think of the
developmental processes by which organisms progress from egg to adult
in terms of the execution of a “developmental
program”. Other biologists have argued for a pivotal role for
information in evolution rather than development: John Maynard Smith
and Eors Szathmáry (for example) suggest that major transitions in
evolution depend on expansions in the amount and accuracy with which
information is transmitted across generations. And some have argued
that we can only understand the evolutionary role of genes by
recognizing an informational “domain” that exists
alongside the domain of matter and energy. 
Both philosophers and biologists have contributed to an ongoing
foundational discussion of the status of this mode of description in
biology. It is generally agreed that the sense of information isolated
by Claude Shannon and used in mathematical information theory is
legitimate, useful, and relevant in many parts of biology. In this
sense, anything is a source of information if it has a range
of possible states, and one variable carries information
about another to the extent that their states are physically
correlated. But it is also agreed that many uses of informational
language in biology seem to make use of a richer and more problematic
concept than Shannon’s. Some have drawn on
the teleosemantic tradition in philosophy of mind to make
sense of this richer concept.  Other theorists have countered that Shannon’s correlational conception of information is richer than it looks.
A minority tradition has argued that the enthusiasm for information
in biology has been a serious theoretical wrong turn, and that it
fosters naive genetic determinism, other distortions of our
understanding of the roles of interacting causes, or an implicitly
dualist ontology. However, this sceptical response is fading, with key
sceptics coming to accept a modest but genuine role for informational
concepts in the life sciences. Others have taken the critique seriously but
tried to distinguish legitimate appeals to information from misleading
or erroneous ones.

[Editor's Note: The following new entry by Jay Odenbaugh replaces the

One way of conceptualizing the structure of a science is that at any
time it contains ontologies, theories, and
values (Kuhn 1962; Lakatos 1976; Laudan 1978, 1986). In this
entry, we explore questions regarding the ontology, theoretical
structure, and values central to conservation biology. First,
conservation biology as a discipline has expended a great deal of
intellectual effort in articulating exactly what is its object of
study and has settled on biodiversity as the answer. However, there is
a debate concerning what biodiversity is, and whether it should be
center stage in the discipline. Second, conservation biology, though a
scientific discipline with its theories, models, experiments, and
fieldwork also utilizes a variety of tools, which do not fit into the
above categories. That is, some of its core tools are not theories or
models in the ordinary sense. Thus, as a discipline, it is appears
interestingly unique and ultimately unlike ones that philosophers of
science have typically examined. Third, conservation biology was
originally articulated by the early pioneers as a “crisis
discipline” where certain types of normative concerns were at
the forefront. In fact, many have likened it to medicine insofar as it
has ethical foundations. In the medical case, it would be the
well-being of patients and in conservation biology it is the
conservation of biodiversity. Thus, we should ask are the
discipline’s aims or values explicitly ethical or sociopolitical
and to what extent are they controversial?

Developmental biology is the science of explaining how a variety of
interacting processes generate an organism’s heterogeneous
shapes, size, and structural features that arise on the trajectory
from embryo to adult, or more generally throughout a life cycle. It
represents an exemplary area of contemporary experimental biology that
focuses on phenomena that have puzzled natural philosophers and
scientists for more than two millennia. Philosophers of biology have
shown renewed interest in developmental biology due to the potential
relevance of development for understanding evolution, the theme of
reductionism in genetic explanations, and via increased attention to
the details of particular research programs. Developmental biology
displays a rich array of material and conceptual practices that can be
analyzed to better understand the scientific reasoning exhibited in
experimental life science. This entry briefly reviews some central
phenomena of ontogeny and then explores four domains that
compose a subset of the import and promise of conceptual reflection on
the epistemology of developmental biology.

Experiment in Biology,0.9325937628746032,0.5315910577774048,"

Like the philosophy of science in general, the philosophy of biology
has traditionally been mostly concerned with theories. For a variety
of reasons, the theory that has by far attracted the most interest is
evolutionary theory. There was a period in the philosophy of biology
when this field was almost identical with the philosophy of
evolutionary theory, especially if debates on the nature of species
are included in this area. From the 1960s almost until the 1990s,
basically the only non-evolutionary topic discussed was the issue of
the reduction (or non-reduction) of classical genetics to molecular
genetics. In the 1990s, practitioners of the field finally started to
move into other areas of biology such as cell biology, molecular
biology, immunology, neuroscience, as well as addressing philosophical
issues other than theory reduction (e.g., Darden 1991; Burian 1992,
1997; Schaffner 1993; Bechtel and Richardson 1993; Rheinberger 1997).
As these are profoundly experimental disciplines, an increased
attention to the experiment in biology was inevitable. Thus, what is
generally known as the “New Experimentalism” in general
philosophy of science arose more or less independently in the
philosophy of biology, even though this fact has not been advertised
much. Perhaps, the increased focus on experimentation was more due to
the influence of historians of biology and their practical turn than
due to the “New Experimentalists” in general philosophy of
science such as Hacking (1983), Franklin (1986) or Mayo (1996). At any
rate, today there is a wealth of historical as well as philosophical
scholarship that closely studies what goes on in biological
laboratories. Some of this literature relates to classical issues in
philosophy of science, but it has also explored new philosophical
ground.

There are issues in the philosophy of biological experimentation that
also arise in other experimental sciences, for example, issues that
have to do with causal inference, experimental testing, the
reliability of data, the problem of experimental artifacts, and the
rationality of scientific practice. Experimental biological knowledge
is sufficiently different from other kinds of scientific knowledge to
merit a separate philosophical treatment of these issues. In addition,
there are issues that arise exclusively in biology, such as the role
of model organisms. In what follows, both kinds of issues will be
considered.

How we should think about biological individuals or agents and the
roles they play in processes such as natural selection, speciation, and
organismic development have become lively topics of discussion in the
philosophy of biology in recent years. Individual organisms have been
central to philosophical reflection on such processes, but they are not
the only type of biological individual. For example, both genes and
groups have been considered kinds of biological individual that
function as units of selection. And some propose genomes are biological
agents that code for organismal development. Focusing on organisms as
one prominent kind of biological individual sheds substantial light on
what biological individuals are. But to address broader questions about
the structure of the biological world and its relation to human
thought, we also need to reflect on biological individuals more
generally.

The growth of philosophical interest in biology over the past thirty 
years reflects the increasing prominence of the biological sciences 
in the same period. There is now an extensive literature on many 
different biological topics, and it would be impossible to summarise 
this body of work in this single entry. Instead, this entry sets out 
to explain what philosophy of biology is. Why does biology 
matter to philosophy and vice versa? A list of the entries in the 
encyclopedia which address specific topics in the philosophy of 
biology is provided at the end of the entry.


Three different kinds of philosophical enquiry fall under the general
heading of philosophy of biology. First, general theses in the 
philosophy of science are addressed in the context of biology. 
Second, conceptual puzzles within biology itself are subjected to 
philosophical analysis. Third, appeals to biology are made in 
discussions of traditional philosophical questions. The first two 
kinds of philosophical work are typically conducted in the context of
a detailed knowledge of actual biology, the third less so. 


Philosophy of biology can also be subdivided by the particular areas 
of biological theory with which it is concerned. Biology is a diverse
set of disciplines, ranging from historical sciences such as 
paleontology to engineering sciences such as biotechnology. Different
philosophical issues occur in each field. The latter part of the 
entry discusses how philosophers have approached some of the main 
disciplines within biology.

Reductionism in Biology,0.9286046624183656,0.5001540184020996,"

Reductionism encompasses a set of ontological, epistemological, and
methodological claims about the relations between different scientific
domains. The basic question of reduction is whether the properties,
concepts, explanations, or methods from one scientific domain
(typically at higher levels of organization) can be deduced from or
explained by the properties, concepts, explanations, or methods from
another domain of science (typically at lower levels of organization).
Reduction is germane to a variety of issues in philosophy of science,
including the structure of scientific theories, the relations between
scientific disciplines, the nature of explanation, the diversity of
methodology, and notions of theoretical progress, as well as to
numerous topics in metaphysics and philosophy of mind, such as
emergence, mereology, and supervenience.

In philosophy of biology, debates about reduction have focused on the
question of whether and in what sense classical genetics can be
reduced to molecular biology. Although other strands of discussion
have been present (e.g., whether evolutionary theory is inherently
anti-reductionist because of the principle of natural selection),
philosophical debates increasingly address a wider array of domains
(e.g., development, ecology, evolution, cell biology, and
neuroscience), and include additional questions about the nature and
status of interdisciplinarity, such as the integration of data or
standards across biological fields. Questions about reduction in
biology are pervasive throughout the history of philosophy and
science. Many contemporary debates have historical analogues that
reflect long-standing controversies about the legitimacy of
reductionist research strategies and modes of explanation used by
different life science subdisciplines.

This entry aims to clarify how systems and synthetic biology
contribute to and extend discussions within philosophy of science.
Unlike fields such as developmental biology or molecular biology,
systems and synthetic biology are not easily demarcated by a focus on
a specific subject area or level of organization. Rather, they are
characterized by the development and application of mathematical,
computational, and synthetic modeling strategies in response to
complex problems and challenges within the life sciences. Proponents
of systems and synthetic biology often stress the necessity of a
perspective that goes beyond the scope of molecular biology and
genetic engineering, respectively. With the emphasis on systems and
interaction networks, the approaches explicitly engage in one of the
oldest philosophical discussions on the relationship between parts and
wholes, or between reductionism and holism. Such questions are,
however, reframed in the new light of strategies for large-scale data
production and dynamic modeling that are inspired by non-biological
disciplines such as engineering. Systems and synthetic biology thus
shed new light on important discussions in philosophy of biology, but
they are also philosophically interesting for their own sake. By
pursuing ambitious aims such as the development of multiscale
computational models and synthetic life forms, they uncover new ground
for philosophical analysis. Systems and synthetic biology raise
fundamental questions about how far research can be taken through
computational approaches, about the relation between living and
artificial systems, and about the implications of interdisciplinary
research for science and society.

Teleological Notions in Biology,0.9636301994323728,0.5454212427139282,"


Teleological terms such as ""function"" and ""design"" appear frequently in
the biological sciences. Examples of teleological claims include: 

A (biological) function of stotting by antelopes is to communicate
to predators that they have been detected.
Eagles' wings are (naturally) designed for soaring.



Teleological notions were commonly associated with the pre-Darwinian
view that the biological realm provides evidence of conscious design by
a supernatural creator. Even after creationist viewpoints were rejected
by most biologists there remained various grounds for concern about the
role of teleology in biology, including whether such terms are:

vitalistic (positing some special ""life-force"");
requiring backwards causation (because future outcomes explain
present traits);
incompatible with mechanistic explanation (because of 1 and
2);
mentalistic (attributing the action of mind where there is
none);
empirically untestable (for all the above reasons).



Opinions divide over whether Darwin's theory of evolution provides a
means of eliminating teleology from biology, or whether it provides a
naturalistic account of the role of teleological notions in the
science. Many contemporary biologists and philosophers of biology
believe that teleological notions are a distinctive and ineliminable
feature of biological explanations but that it is possible to provide a
naturalistic account of their role that avoids the concerns above.
Terminological issues sometimes serve to obscure some widely-accepted
distinctions.

Feminist Philosophy of Biology,0.630664587020874,0.7100957632064819,"


Practitioners of feminist philosophy of biology use gender as an
analytic category to conduct philosophical investigations of the
biological sciences. Feminist philosophy of biology deploys feminist
philosophical methods to examine the categories of sex and gender (sex
and gender will be explained below) and its focus can range from
considerations of particular biological knowledge claims to
considerations of foundational concepts and methodologies in biology,
the philosophy of biology, and the philosophy of science. In
doing so, feminist philosophers of biology often show that the
philosophical investigations of a particular science are intertwined
with both ethics and politics.


This entry is divided into five sections. The introductory
section discusses some of the challenges of defining feminist
philosophy of biology and highlights areas of commonality with
non-feminist philosophy of biology. The second section explores the
variety of motivations and epistemic perspectives found within feminist
philosophy of biology. The third section considers, in some
depth, two central examples of feminist analysis of biological
research: a) sexual selection and b) sociobiology and evolutionary
psychology of sex and gender. In section four I discuss feminist
analyses of some foundational concepts within philosophy of biology and
philosophy of science more generally, such as biological determinism
and reductionism. Many of these foundational concepts are
considered by both feminist and non-feminist philosophers of
biology. The entry concludes with a discussion of opportunities

Blame,0.567313551902771,0.7497339248657227,"

Blame is a reaction to something of negative normative significance
about someone or their behavior. A paradigm case, perhaps, would be
when one person wrongs another, and the latter responds with
resentment and a verbal rebuke, but of course we also blame others for
their attitudes and characters (see, e.g., Smith 2005). Thus blaming
scenarios typically involve a wide range of inward and outward
responses to a wrongful or bad action, attitude, or character (such
responses include: beliefs, desires, expectations, emotions,
sanctions, and so on). In theorizing about blame, then, philosophers
have typically asked two questions:

 Which precise reactions and interactions constitute blame?
 Under what conditions is it appropriate to respond in these
ways?


Many theorists approach these questions with a larger theoretical
agenda in mind: for example, in an effort to understand the conditions
of moral responsibility more generally and the nature of freedom
(e.g., Wallace 1994), or in an effort to articulate the content of
moral properties (e.g., Gibbard 1990). But the questions are
interesting in their own right, especially since blame is such a
common feature of moral experience. This entry will critically discuss
the answers that have been offered in response to the above questions
concerning blame, with the aim of shedding some light on blame’s
nature, ethics, and significance. (A common but by no means universal
assumption is that praise is the counterpart of blame; still, it is
blame that is often taken to be the more significant phenomenon for
moral philosophy.)

Jean Bodin (1529/30–1596) was a lawyer, economist, natural
philosopher, historian, and one of the major political theorists of
the sixteenth century. There are two reasons why Bodin remains both
fascinating and enigmatic: on the one hand, aspects of his life remain
shrouded in legend; on the other, misunderstandings about his thought
and political positions have engendered contradictions and
discrepancies amongst historians which have been attributed mistakenly
to Bodin himself. His most significant work, The Six Books of the
Commonwealth (Les Six livres de la République,
1576), represents the sum total of legal and political thought of the
French Renaissance. His Method for the Easy Comprehension of
History (Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem,
1566) is at the pinnacle of early-modern, European humanism’s Ars
historica. Finally, his work — if he was genuinely really
the author — Colloquium of the Seven about Secrets of the
Sublime (Colloquium Heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis
abditis, 1683), which was published posthumously, provides clues
about his own religious views.  Bodin’s spiritual beliefs did not
coincide with any official religion of his day, but instead resembled
a form of natural religion.

 In this entry, we cite Bodin’s original works and their translations

Substance,0.6903370022773743,0.28990939259529114,"


Many of the concepts analysed by philosophers have their origin in
ordinary—or at least extra-philosophical—language.
Perception, knowledge, causation, and mind would be examples of this.
But the concept of substance is essentially a philosophical term of
art. Its uses in ordinary language tend to derive, often in a rather
distorted way, from the philosophical senses. (Such expressions as
‘a person of substance’ or ‘a substantial
reason’ would be cases of this. ‘Illegal substances’
is nearer to one of the philosophical uses, but not the main one.)
There is an ordinary concept in play when philosophers discuss
‘substance’, and this, as we shall see, is the concept of
object, or thing when this is contrasted with
properties or events. But such ‘individual substances’ are
never termed ‘substances’ outside philosophy.


There could be said to be two rather different ways of
characterizing the philosophical concept of substance. The
first is the more generic. The philosophical term
‘substance’ corresponds to the Greek ousia, which
means ‘being’, transmitted via the Latin
substantia, which means ‘something that stands under or
grounds things’. According to the generic sense, therefore, the
substances in a given philosophical system are those things which,
according to that system, are the foundational or fundamental entities
of reality. Thus, for an atomist, atoms are the substances, for they
are the basic things from which everything is constructed. In David
Hume's system, impressions and ideas are the substances, for the same
reason. In a slightly different way, Forms are Plato's substances, for
everything derives its existence from Forms. In this sense of
‘substance’ any realist philosophical system acknowledges
the existence of substances. Probably the only theories which do not
would be those forms of logical positivism or pragmatism which treat
ontology as a matter of convention. According to such theories, there
are no real facts about what is ontologically basic, and so nothing is
objectively substance.


The second use of the concept is more specific. According to this,
substances are a particular kind of basic entity, and some
philosophical theories acknowledge them and others do not. On this
use, Hume's impressions and ideas are not substances, even though they
are the building blocks of—what constitutes ‘being’
for—his world. According to this usage, it is a live issue
whether the fundamental entities are substances or something else,
such as events, or properties located at space-times. This conception
of substance derives from the intuitive notion of individual
thing or object, which contrast mainly with
properties and events. The issue is how we are to understand the notion
of an object, and whether, in the light of the correct understanding,
it remains a basic notion, or one that must be characterized in more
fundamental terms. Whether, for example, an object can be thought of as
nothing more than a bundle of properties, or a series of events.

Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius,0.6863947510719299,0.16393767297267914,"


Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius (born: circa 475–7 C.E.,
died: 526? C.E.) has long been recognized as one of the most important
intermediaries between ancient philosophy and the Latin Middle Ages
and, through his Consolation of Philosophy, as a talented
literary writer, with a gift for making philosophical ideas dramatic
and accessible to a wider public. He had previously translated
Aristotle’s logical works into Latin, written commentaries on them as
well as logical textbooks, and used his logical training to contribute
to the theological discussions of the time. All these writings, which
would be enormously influential in the Middle Ages, drew extensively
on the thinking of Greek Neoplatonists such as Porphyry and
Iamblichus. Recent work has also tried to identify and evaluate
Boethius’s own contribution, as an independent thinker, though one
working within a tradition which put little obvious weight on
philosophical originality. Both aspects of Boethius will be considered
in the sections which follow.

Bohr's Correspondence Principle,0.9420779347419742,0.31474995613098145,"


Regarding Bohr's correspondence principle, the historian of physics
Max Jammer writes, “[T]here was rarely in the history of physics
a comprehensive theory which owed so much to one principle as quantum
mechanics owed to Bohr's correspondence principle” (Jammer 1966,
p. 118). The correspondence principle not only played a pivotal role in
the discovery of quantum mechanics but was also the cornerstone of
Bohr's philosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics, being closely
tied to his better known thesis of complementarity and to the
Copenhagen interpretation.


Although the importance of Bohr's correspondence principle is
largely undisputed, there is far less agreement concerning how the
correspondence principle should be defined. It is important to
distinguish between Bohr's own understanding of this principle and what
it came to mean for the larger physics community. Even if one restricts
oneself to Bohr's writings, however, there is still a disagreement
among Bohr scholars regarding precisely which of the several relations
between classical and quantum mechanics that Bohr discovered should be
designated as the correspondence principle. There are three
primary candidate-definitions in the literature. First, there is the
frequency interpretation, according to which the
correspondence principle is a statistical asymptotic agreement between
one component in the Fourier decomposition of the classical frequency
and the quantum frequency in the limit of large quantum numbers.
Second, there is the intensity interpretation according to
which it is a statistical agreement in the limit of large quantum
numbers between the quantum intensity, understood in terms of the
probability of a quantum transition, and the classical intensity,
understood as the square of the amplitude of one component of the
classical motion. Finally, there is the selection rule
interpretation, according to which the correspondence principle is
the statement that each allowed quantum transition between stationary
states corresponds to one harmonic component of the classical
motion.


The correspondence principle was first articulated in 1913 in the
context of the old quantum theory. Nonetheless, Bohr argued that this
principle survived the replacement of the old quantum theory by modern
quantum mechanics. The correspondence principle is still referred to
today in the physics literature as a subject of current research,
though arguably with a meaning that is somewhat different from Bohr's
own understanding of this principle. A version of the correspondence
principle also lives on in the philosophical literature where it has
been generalized into a broad methodological principle (the generalized
correspondence principle) constraining the development of new
scientific theories.

Bernard Bolzano,0.808704674243927,0.7140602469444275,"


Bernard Bolzano (1781–1848) was a Catholic priest, a professor
of the doctrine of Catholic religion at the Philosophical Faculty of
the University of Prague, an outstanding mathematician and one of the
greatest logicians or even (as some would have it) the
greatest logician who lived in the long stretch of time between
Leibniz and Frege. As far as logic is concerned, Bolzano anticipated
almost exactly 100 years before Tarski and Carnap their semantic
definitions of logical truth and logical consequence; and in
mathematics he is not only known for his famous Paradoxes of the
Infinite, but also for certain results that have become and still
are standard in textbooks of mathematics such as the
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Bolzano also made important contributions
to other fields of knowledge in and outside of philosophy. Due to the
versatility of his talents and the various fields to which he made
substantial contributions he became one of the last great polymaths in
the history of ideas.


The presentation of Bolzano's personality that is given here
would still be incomplete unless it were added that Bolzano was also a
great philanthropist. This becomes evident not only by Bolzano's
writings in ethics and political philosophy, but it also manifests
itself in practice by his activities for the benefit of the poor,
subjugated, discriminated and disadvantaged people. Together with his
friends and pupils he supported activities in favor of such things as
poorhouses, homes for the blind, loan banks for the working-class, and
libraries and elementary schools in the countryside. 


The first section of the article deals with Bolzano's biography, and
the second section presents a survey of Bolzano's main writings; the
following sections (3 to 12) are devoted to the different branches of
philosophy to which Bolzano made contributions. In the final section
(13) Bolzano's influence on the development of the sciences and on the
intellectual life in Bohemia is considered.

Bolzano's Logic,0.8088691830635071,0.7141215801239014,"
Bernard Bolzano (1781–1848), of Italian-German origin, was
born and died in Prague. He spent his entire life in Bohemia (today
part of the Czech Republic), which remained part of the Austrian
Empire until 1918. He studied philosophy, mathematics and theology and
became a Catholic priest and professor of the science of religion at
the University of Prague. He devoted his life to the reform of the
backward semi-feudal Austrian society and of the a priori
sciences: logic, mathematics and theology. Because of his unorthodox
views on the constitution and the government, he was removed in 1819
from the University and spent the rest of his life in retirement
writing treatises on the theory of science (1837), mathematics
(Grössenlehre, manuscript not yet completely
published), Science of Religion (1834), a utopia On the
Best State (published only in 1932) and the posthumous Paradoxes of the
infinite (1851).
Bolzano's presentation of logic is embedded in the vast Theory
of Science (henceforth TS). His logic is based on the
abstract concepts of propositions and ideas in themselves (an
sich), which are independent of thought and language. His logic
of ideas contains a new treatment of their content and extension and,
among other things, provides an analysis of ideas without objects. A
purely logical definition of intuitions as simple singular ideas
allowed Bolzano to distinguish them from concepts and to characterize
the traditional epistemological distinction between a priori
and a posteriori in terms of the logical distinction between
conceptual and empirical propositions (and sciences). The main
innovations of Bolzano's logic consist in the definitions of validity,
analyticity and logical truth, and the creation of a complete system
of extensional relations between propositions, the most important of
these being compatibility, deducibility (= consequence), and
equivalence. Bolzano discovered the link between deducibility and
conditional probability, according to which deducibility and
incompatibility appear as two limit cases of conditional probability
(this idea was taken over or reinvented by Wittgenstein in
the Tractatus). Deductive logic is thus extended to inductive
logic based on probability. Bolzano's theory of the grounding relation
(Abfolge) leading to a hierarchical order of theorems is the
first modern study of axiomatic systems. Morover, the thorough
discussions of concepts of logic and many other insights contribute to
make the TS one of the classical works in logic and
epistemology, on a par with those of Aristotle, Leibniz, and Frege.
The extensive historical notes contained in it are a unique source for
the history of logic. Although written in natural language, Bolzano's
logic represents a decisive breakthrough in the development of modern
logic.

Saint Bonaventure,0.6712446212768555,0.2051311880350113,"


Bonaventure of Bagnoregio (ca. 1217 to 15 July 1274), the religious
name of Giovanni di Fidanza, was a Franciscan friar, Master of
Theology at the University of Paris, Minister General of the
Franciscan Order, and Cardinal of the Catholic Church. During his
lifetime he rose to become one of the most prominent men in Latin
Christianity. His academic career as a theologian was cut short when
in 1257 he was put in charge of the Order of Friars Minor (O.F.M.). He
steered the Franciscans on a moderate and intellectual course that
made them the most prominent order in the Catholic Church until the
coming of the Jesuits. His theology was marked by an attempt
completely to integrate faith and reason. He thought of Christ as the
“one true master” who offers humans knowledge that begins
in faith, is developed through rational understanding, and is
perfected by mystical union with God.

  A master of the memorable phrase, Bonaventure held that philosophy
opens the mind to at least three different routes humans can take on
their journey to God. Non-intellectual material creatures he conceived
as shadows and vestiges (literally, footprints) of God, understood as
the ultimate cause of a world philosophical reason can prove was
created at a first moment in time. Intellectual creatures he conceived
of as images and likenesses of God, the workings of the human mind and
will leading us to God understood as illuminator of knowledge and
donor of grace and virtue. The final route to God is the route of
being, in which Bonaventure brought Anselm's argument together with
Aristotelian and Neoplatonic metaphysics to view God as the absolutely
perfect being whose essence entails its existence, an absolutely
simple being that causes all other, composite beings to exist. These
three routes are outlined in Sections 3, 4, and 5 below.

George Boole,0.9523730278015136,0.795075535774231,"


George Boole (1815–1864) was an English mathematician and a
founder of the algebraic tradition in logic. He worked as a
schoolmaster in England and from 1849 until his death as professor of
mathematics at Queen’s University, Cork, Ireland. He revolutionized
logic by applying methods from the then-emerging field of symbolic
algebra to logic. Where traditional (Aristotelian) logic relied on
cataloging the valid syllogisms of various simple forms, Boole’s
method provided general algorithms in an algebraic language which
applied to an infinite variety of arguments of arbitrary
complexity. These results appeared in two major works,
The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847)
and
The Laws of Thought (1854).

Boolean algebra is the algebra of two-valued logic with only
sentential connectives, or equivalently of algebras of sets under
union and complementation. The rigorous concept is that of a certain
kind of algebra, analogous to the mathematical notion of a
group. This concept has roots and applications in logic
(Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras and model theory), set theory (fields of
sets), topology (totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces),
foundations of set theory (Boolean-valued models), measure theory
(measure algebras), functional analysis (algebras of projections),
and ring theory (Boolean rings).  The study of Boolean algebras
has several aspects: structure theory, model theory of Boolean
algebras, decidability and undecidability questions for the class of
Boolean algebras, and the indicated applications. In addition,
although not explained here, there are connections to other logics,
subsumption as a part of special kinds of algebraic logic, finite
Boolean algebras and switching circuit theory,  and Boolean
matrices.

Boundary,0.8093605041503906,0.3011763095855713,"


We think of a boundary whenever we think of an entity demarcated from
its surroundings. There is a boundary (a line) separating Maryland and
Pennsylvania. There is a boundary (a circle) isolating the interior of
a disc from its exterior. There is a boundary (a surface) enclosing
the bulk of this apple. Sometimes the exact location of a boundary is
unclear or otherwise controversial (as when you try to trace out the
margins of Mount Everest, or even the boundary of your own
body). Sometimes the boundary lies skew to any physical discontinuity
or qualitative differentiation (as with the border of Wyoming, or the
boundary between the upper and lower halves of a homogeneous
sphere). But whether sharp or blurry, natural or artificial, for every
object there appears to be a boundary that marks it off from the rest
of the world. Events, too, have boundaries — at least temporal
boundaries. Our lives are bounded by our births and by our deaths; the
soccer game began at 3pm sharp and ended with the referee's final
whistle at 4:45pm. It is sometimes suggested that even abstract
entities, such as concepts or sets, have boundaries of their own, and
Wittgenstein could emphatically proclaim that the boundaries of our
language are the boundaries of our world (1921: 5.6). Whether all this
boundary talk is coherent, however, and whether it reflects the
structure of the world or simply the organizing activity of our mind,
are matters of deep philosophical controversy.

Robert Boyle,0.603400468826294,0.2955779433250427,"


Boyle was one of the leading intellectual figures of the seventeenth
century. He was a dedicated experimenter, unwilling to construct
abstract theories to which his results had to conform. “Our Boyle,”
Oldenburg wrote to Spinoza, “is one of those who are distrustful
enough of their reasoning to wish that the phenomena should agree with
it” (Hall & Hall 1965–1977, 2:38). Boyle, a champion of both the
corpuscularian doctrine and the Baconian method of natural history,
preferred to report the results of his experiments, including negative
results, and frequently lamented the fact that we lacked “histories”
(collections of experimental results and accurate observations) in
various fields of scientific endeavour.  He performed so many
experiments that he was able, at one “time to loose … at once
near five centuries of Experiments of my own” (BP 9:28). Nor was this
an isolated loss; nonetheless the number, variety and scope of his
experiments were such that he carried on working and publishing with
no particular difficulty. “His books,” as Huygens remarked to Leibniz
immediately after Boyle's death, “are full of experiments” (Huygens
1888, 10:239). Moreover, experiments were exactly what he was
interested in, he had a certain missionary zeal in spreading the
corpuscularian gospel, but he was not himself interested in detailed
system
 building,[1]
 a fact that was commonly noted. Leibniz told Huygens that he was
“astonished” that Boyle “who has so many fine experiments, [had] not
come to some theory of chemistry after meditating so long on them. Yet
in his books, and for all the consequences that he draws from his
observations, he concludes only what we all know, that everything
happens mechanically. He is perhaps too reserved. Excellent men should
leave us even their conjectures; they are wrong if they wish to give
us only those truths that are certain” (Leibniz to Huygens, Dec. 29,
1691, in Huygens 1888, 10:228). Boyle was ahead of his time. In the
next century d'Alembert wrote “the taste for systems … is today
almost entirely banished from works of merit … a writer among
us who praised systems would have come too late” (d'Alembert 1751,
 94).[2]


Boyle was a corpuscularian, a term he employed to paper over the
differences between believers in a vacuum, and believers in a plenum,
given that both of them agreed that the explanation of natural
occurrences should be solely in terms of particles of matter, their
motion and interaction. Boyle consistently refused to pronounce on the
question of whether these minima naturalia should be
considered atoms, in the strict sense of that term, or
 not.[3]


Even a metaphysical non-corpuscularian such as Leibniz agreed with
Boyle in practical terms. “However much I agree with the Scholastics in
this general and, so to speak, metaphysical explanation of the
principles of bodies,” he wrote to Arnauld in July 1686, “I am as
corpuscular as one can be in the explanation of particular phenomena,
and it is saying nothing to allege that they have forms or qualities”
(Gerhardt 1875, 2:58, trans. Mason 1967).


Boyle's scientific range was wide. Besides his well known work in
mechanics, medicine, hydrodynamics and a wide variety of experiments
with his vacuum pump, he was interested both theoretically and
practically in alchemy (see Principe 1998, Clericuzio 2000, Newman and
Principe 2002), where his interest seems to have been fueled more by
his constant desire to acquire knowledge of God and the world than by
any desire for riches. He “cultivated Chymistry with a disinterested
mind,” seeking the improvement of his own knowledge, “the
gratifying the Curious & the Industrious; and the Acquist
of some useful helps to make good & uncommon
 Medicins.”[4]
 As a corpuscularian he believed that transmutation was physically
possible.  As a person he believed that it actually occurred. He
believed that in his own laboratory gold had been transmuted into a
“baser metal” with a specific gravity about two thirds of that of
gold, and since he was, he said, more interested in the luciferous
aspect of discovery than the lucriferous, he found the process equally
interesting in either
 direction.[5]


During the course of his life he sought constantly to improve the
lot of humanity. He was interested in the improvement of agricultural
methods, in the possibility of extracting fresh water from salt, in the
improvement of medicines and medicinal practice, in the possibility of
preserving food by vacuum packing, and in a number of other useful
results, actual or potential, of experimental philosophy. He viewed his
theological interests and his work in natural philosophy as forming a
seamless whole and constantly used results from the one area to
enlighten matters in the other. (On the relation between science and
religion in Boyle's thought see Hunter 2000.)


Convinced that Christianity was the religion instituted by God,
Boyle was concerned that the Bible should be widely promulgated and he
devoted time and energy to having it translated into a variety of
languages such as Irish, Turkish, and various native American
languages. He viewed such conversion attempts as being on all fours
with his attempts to find more efficacious medicines for:
To convert Infidels to the Christian Religion is a work of
great Charity and kindnes to men. I. In regard of the evills it frees
them from, such as, (1) the gross errors and prejudices they had

Francis Herbert Bradley,0.743292510509491,0.5942260026931763,"


F. H. Bradley (1846–1924) was the most famous, original and
philosophically influential of the British Idealists. These
philosophers came to prominence in the closing decades of the
nineteenth century, but their effect on British philosophy and society
at large — and, through the positions of power attained by some
of their pupils in the institutions of the British Empire, on much of
the world — persisted well into the first half of the
twentieth. They stood out amongst their peers in consciously rejecting
some main aspects of the tradition of their earlier compatriots, such
as Hume and Mill, and responding, albeit in an original and critical
fashion, rather to the work of Kant and Hegel.


But it would involve a significant degree of distortion to depict the
British Idealists as simply choosing Hegel over Hume, as the
denomination ‘Neo-Hegelians’ all too easily suggests. On
the contrary, they were open to a variety of influences, including the
philosophy of an anti-idealist thinker such as J.F. Herbart and of the
subsequently forgotten but then prominent Hermann Lotze, an
independent mind whose speculations are difficult to classify in terms
of the idealist/realist opposition. Upon the whole, the Idealists
revitalized British philosophy by making it permeable to a rich
variety of continental ideas. In this way, they helped prepare the
ground on which analytic philosophy would eventually flourish, as most
Idealists were very well acquainted with the works of Frege’s
contemporaries (e.g. Sigwart) and discussed their ideas in their
logical treatises. Bradley was a leading figure in this movement of
original reappropriation of alien ideas, which he explicitly promoted
as the sole antidote to dogmatism and intellectual sclerosis in the
‘Preface’ to Appearance and
Reality. ‘The present generation’, he said,
‘is learning that to gain education a man must study in more
than one school’ (p. viii).


It is for his metaphysics that Bradley has become best known. He
argued that our everyday conceptions of the world (as well as those
more refined ones common among his philosophical predecessors) contain
hidden contradictions which appear, fatally, when we try to think out
their consequences. In particular, Bradley rejected on these grounds
the view that reality can be understood as consisting of many objects
existing independently of each other (pluralism) and of our experience
of them (realism). Consistently, his own view combined substance
monism — the claim that reality is one, that there are no real
separate things — with metaphysical idealism — the claim
that reality consists solely of idea or experience. This vision of the
world had a profound effect on the verse of T.S. Eliot, who studied
philosophy at Harvard and wrote a Ph.D. thesis on Bradley.


On later generations of philosophers, however, Bradley’s contributions
to moral philosophy and the philosophy of logic were far more
influential than his metaphysics. His critical examination of hedonism
— the view that the goal of morality is the maximization of
general pleasure — was seminal and stands as a permanent
contribution to the subject which can still be read with profit
today. Some of the doctrines of his logic have become standard and
unnoticed assumptions through their acceptance by Bertrand Russell, an
acceptance which survived Russell’s subsequent repudiation of idealist
logic and metaphysics.


Other notable figures among the British Idealists were Bernard
Bosanquet, Edward Caird, T.H. Green, Harold Joachim and J.M.E.

Francis Herbert Bradley's Moral and Political Philosophy,0.5751915574073792,0.6531912684440613,"
The ethical writings of the Oxford Idealists, T. H. Green and
F. H. Bradley, reflect the influence of Kant and Hegel on English
moral philosophy in the latter part of the Nineteenth Century.  To the
extent that either draws on other sources it is to Aristotle that they
turn rather than to British moral philosophers such as Butler, Hume or
Reid; a point which is evident both from the fact that Green and
Bradley offer a type of perfectionist account of morality that is
articulated in terms of the concept of self-realization and from the
appearance of Aristotle’s man of practical wisdom (the
phronimos) in the fifth essay of Bradley’s Ethical
Studies.  In addition, much of their attention was taken up with
critical analyses of utilitarianism - the dominant ethical theory of
the day - and the hedonism to which it was wedded, whether that view
advanced the primacy of pleasure either in the form of a psychological
account of motivation or as the felt state that right actions aim at
maximizing.  Indeed, Bradley not only had to dispense with the claims
of the older utilitarians, such as Bentham and Mill, but also had to
face the new defense of utilitarianism advanced by Henry Sidgwick, who
published his The Methods of Ethics (1874) virtually
simultaneously with Bradley’s Ethical Studies (1876).  For a
greater part of the Twentieth century Bradley’s critical attacks on
hedonism and utilitarianism were considered to be about the best part
of his book.  During this same period it was also usual to read Essay
V (“My Station and Its Duties”) as expressing Bradley’s own position,
and this was interpreted as derivative, relying heavily on Hegel’s
view of society as an organism of interrelated persons.  It is later
realized, largely because of Peter Nicholson’s studies of the moral
and political philosophy of the British Idealists, that taking the
perspective of “My Station” as final misses the relevance of the next
essay, entitled “Ideal Morality,” in the dialectical progress of
Bradley’s essays.
While this reminder about the importance of the later essays guards
against a serious misreading of the arguments of Ethical
Studies, it invites a different error by suggesting that Bradley
is attempting to identify the supreme moral principle that should
guide human choices and actions. Now, for Sidgwick that is the
whole point of moral philosophy and he criticizes Green’s claim that
the end of action is self-realization on the grounds that this notion
is simply too general and vague to be practically useful in informing
us about what we should do in any given circumstance; and because of
this indeterminacy Sidgwick rejects it as a possible expression of the
supreme moral end.  (Of course, a plurality of irreducible ultimate
principles also leaves us with no clear direction and his finding two
such principles is what leads to the failure of Sidgwick’s own
theory.)  By contrast, it is crucial to recognize that Bradley is not
engaged in, or much interested in, this sort of enterprise. Rather, he
wants to understand the moral perspective and the nature of moral
agents and also to uncover the logical structure of deliberation and
choice.
Ethical Studies was Bradley’s only book on moral
philosophy, published when he was very young, in 1876. Organized
around the concept of self-realization, it presents a metaphysical
ethics in the sense that it is largely concerned with coming to
understand the moral agent, which entails laying bare the structure of
volitional choice. In this respect, Bradley offers a theory of
practical reasoning.  The overarching end of practical reasoning is
self-realization and so it is no surprise that Bradley thinks the main
objective of moral action is to become as morally good as we can,
making the world morally better in the process.  This perfectionist
theory is developed and defended not in terms of the moral virtues and
their contribution to the good life, but on the ground that the
realization of the self is a necessary feature of the logical
structure of intentionally willed moral actions.
 The basic data for analysis of moral action come from observing
the practical judgments ordinary people make and their understanding
and use of normative concepts. The role of the philosopher is to
explain this moral world rather than to generate principles dictating
how people should act. In this respect, Bradley offers a descriptive
rather than a prescriptive ethical theory. Yet, he holds it equally
important to learn how a child develops from a creature with appetites
and needs into a mature, reflective moral agent capable of complex
deliberations and choices. Answering this question requires a
psychological theory of moral development which explains why
individuals pursue the specific goals they do. In this respect
Ethical Studies has something of the flavor of a naturalized
ethics. Bradley claims that proving that the ultimate end of action is
self-realization would require establishing the nature of the self, of
reality and the process of realization, which would amount to having a
developed system of metaphysics, and that, lacking this, the best he
can do is to explain the thesis and try to make it plausible
(Ethical Studies, p. 65). The reader should not be fooled by
this. Metaphysics was always Bradley’s primary philosophical interest
and his moral theory is shaped by his metaphysical views, some of
which are already discernable in Ethical Studies. The lament
that he does not have a fully developed view, which is common in his
writings, merely reflects his feeling that there is always more to be
said - at least until a fully developed metaphysical treatise reveals
Reality to us.

Bradley's Regress,0.7448112964630127,0.5897671580314636,"

“Bradley’s Regress” is an umbrella term for a family
of arguments that lie at the heart of the ontological debate
concerning properties and relations. The original arguments were
articulated by the British idealist philosopher F. H. Bradley, who, in
his work Appearance and Reality (1893), outlined three
distinct regress arguments against the relational unity of properties.
Bradley argued that a particular thing (a lump of sugar) is nothing
more than a bundle of qualities (whiteness,
sweetness, and hardness) unified into a cohesive
whole via a relation of some sort. But relations, for Bradley, were
deeply problematic. Conceived as “independent” from their
relata, they would themselves need further relations to relate them to
the original relata, and so on ad infinitum. Conceived as
“internal” to their relata, they would not relate
qualities at all, and would also need further relations to relate them
to qualities. From this, Bradley concluded that a relational unity of
qualities is unattainable and, more generally, that relations are
incoherent and should not be thought of as real.

In the decades since its original formulation by F. H. Bradley,
“Bradley’s regress” has come to refer to a wider
variety of arguments. This diversification has happened in two main
directions: (i) with respect to the ontology that the argument targets;
and (ii) with respect to the argument-type presented. (i)
Bradley’s original arguments targeted a one-category ontology of
qualities, where by “qualities” Bradley seemed to have in
mind unrepeatable particularized properties or tropes. The
same argument form, however, has been used against the one-category
ontology of qualities conceived as multiply occurring universals, as
well as against the two-category ontology of particulars and
universals. In fact, one of the most commonly cited versions of
Bradley’s regress in contemporary ontological debate challenges
the possibility of appealing to relations to unify particulars (such
as electrons, apples, chairs) with their respective property
universals (negative charge, roundness,
blackness). The argument aims to show that any appeal to a
relation R (of instantiation, exemplification, etc.) to relate
a particular a with its universal F will require a
further relation R′ to relate the particular a,
the universal F, and the relation R; and so on ad
infinitum. (ii) In contemporary literature,
“Bradley’s regress” has been associated with a
number of arguments and problems that are not, in the way they are
posed, strictly regress arguments. Some of these take the form of the
general problem
about unity, i.e., the question of what is the ontological
ground of the unity of a bundle of tropes/state of affairs as opposed
to the sum/list/set of their constituents. Others are after an
explanation of how relations relate, i.e., the question of
what it is about relations that makes them apt to relate distinct
relata. Still others are after an explanation of the
existence of specific unified complexes, i.e., the question
of what makes it the case that a number of constituents of the right
kinds are actually connected so as to form an existing
fact/state of affairs/bundle of tropes.

In the face of these Bradleyean arguments, philosophers have had a
variety of replies. Some have opted for a rejectionist route
which involves questioning the very assumptions that Bradley’s
arguments make and consequently refusing to reply to the arguments as
stated (for instance, Russell, Blanshard, Alexander, and Grossman have
argued that it is a job of relations to relate and that
Bradley’s relational regresses cannot get started if
relations’ relating role is taken seriously). The majority of
philosophers, however, have accepted some form of the Bradleyan
argument and replied in one of the following ways: 1) by appealing to
a non-relational tie to relate the relata (Bergmann, Strawson,
Armstrong); 2) by invoking external relations in possession of some
special features which make them better apt to relate their relata
(Meinertsen, Vallicella, Maurin, Weiland and Betti); 3) by describing
a special sort of mutual inter-dependence of the would-be relata
(Frege, Baxter, Simons, Perovic); 4) by claiming simply that the
complex entities themselves (such as states of affairs or facts) act
as unifiers of their own constituents (Olson, Armstrong); and 5) by
arguing in favor of the benign nature of an infinite regress
(Armstrong, Orilia).

This entry starts with a historical background of Bradley’s
regress arguments. Section 1 opens with an outline of some of
the historical precursors of Bradley’s regress arguments in
ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy. It then presents in some
detail the regress arguments as they were formulated by Bradley in
Appearance and Reality (1893), as well as Bradley’s
later concerns with complexes and relations. Section 2
discusses the two types of extensions that Bradley’s regress
arguments have undergone—with respect to the ontology that they
apply to, and with respect to the exact sort of problem in view.
Section 3 presents six common types of replies that can be
found in the literature surrounding Bradleyean problems. And
Section 4 concludes by describing some of the recent
applications of the regress arguments in the literature on grounding,
composition of objects, and unity of the proposition.

The Definition of Death,0.5309264063835144,0.835453987121582,"

The philosophical investigation of human death has focused on two
overarching questions: (1) What is human death? and (2) How can we
determine that it has occurred? The first question is ontological or
conceptual. An answer to this question will consist of a
definition (or conceptualization). Examples include
death as the irreversible cessation of organismic functioning
and human death as the irreversible loss of personhood. The
second question is epistemological. A complete answer to this question
will furnish both a general standard (or criterion)
for determining that death has occurred and specific clinical
tests to show whether the standard has been met in a given case.
Examples of standards for human death are the traditional
cardiopulmonary standard and the whole-brain
standard. Insofar as clinical tests are primarily a medical
concern, the present entry will not address them.

The philosophical issues concerning the correct definition and
standard for human death are closely connected to other questions. How
does the death of human beings relate to the death of other living
things? Is human death simply an instance of organismic death,
ultimately a matter of biology? If not, on what basis should it be
defined? Whatever the answers to these questions, does death or at
least human death have an essence—either de re or
de dicto—entailing necessary and jointly sufficient
conditions? Or do the varieties of death reveal only “family
resemblance” relations? Are life and death exhaustive categories
of those things that are ever animated, or do some individuals fall
into an ontological neutral zone between life and death? Finally, how
do our deaths relate, conceptually, to our essence and identity as
human persons?

For the most part, such questions did not clamor for public attention
until well into the twentieth century. (For historical background, see
Pernick 1999 and Capron 1999, 120–124.) Sufficient destruction
of the brain, including the brainstem, ensured respiratory failure
leading quickly to terminal cardiac arrest. Conversely, prolonged
cardiopulmonary failure inevitably led to total, irreversible loss of
brain function. With the invention of mechanical respirators in the
1950s, however, it became possible for a previously lethal extent of
brain damage to coexist with continued cardiopulmonary functioning,
sustaining the functioning of other organs. Was such a patient alive
or dead? The widespread dissemination in the 1960s of such
technologies as mechanical respirators and defibrillators to restore
cardiac function highlighted the possibility of separating
cardiopulmonary and neurological functioning. Quite rapidly the
questions of what constituted human death and how we could determine
its occurrence had emerged as issues both philosophically rich and
urgent.

Various practical concerns provided further impetus for addressing
these issues. (Reflecting these concerns is a landmark 1968 report
published by a Harvard Medical School committee led by physician Henry
Beecher (Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School 1968).)
Soaring medical expenditures provoked concerns about prolonged,
possibly futile treatment of patients who presented some but not all
of the traditionally recognized indicators of death. Certainly, it
would be permissible to discontinue life-supports if these patients
were dead. Concurrent interest in the evolving techniques of organ
transplantation motivated physicians not to delay unnecessarily in
determining that a patient had died. Removing vital organs as quickly
as possible would improve the prospect of saving lives. But removing
vital organs of living patients would cause their deaths, violating
both laws against homicide and the widely accepted moral principle
prohibiting the intentional killing of innocent human beings (see the
entry on
 doing vs. allowing harm).
 To be sure, there were—as there are now—individuals who
held that procuring organs from, thereby killing, irreversibly
unconscious patients who had consented to donate is a legitimate
exception to this moral principle (see the entry on
 voluntary euthanasia),
 but this judgment strikes many as a radical departure from common
morality. In any event, in view of concerns about the possibility of
killing in the course of organ procurement, physicians wanted clear
legal guidance for determining when someone had died.

The remainder of this entry takes a dialectical form, focusing
primarily on ideas and arguments rather than on history and
individuals. It begins with an approach that nearly achieved consensus
status after these issues came under the spotlight in the twentieth
century: the whole-brain approach. (Most of what are here
referred to as “approaches” include a standard and a
corresponding definition of death; a few offer more radical
suggestions for how to understand human death.) The discussion
proceeds, in turn, to the higher-brain approach, to an
updated cardiopulmonary approach, and to several more radical
approaches. The discussion of each approach examines its chief
assertions, its answers to questions identified above, leading
arguments in its favor, and its chief difficulties. The entry as a
whole is intended to identify the main philosophical issues connected
with the definition and determination of human death, leading
approaches that have been developed to address these issues, and
principal strengths and difficulties of these visions viewed as
competitors.

Skepticism and Content Externalism,0.7566060423851013,0.6993277668952942,"

A number of skeptical hypotheses or scenarios have been proposed which
can be used as the basis for arguments to the effect that we lack
knowledge of various propositions about objects in the external world,
propositions that we normally take for granted and that we assume are
obviously true. Descartes’ Evil Genius hypothesis is perhaps the
best known such hypothesis. Another is the brain-in-a-vat hypothesis,
according to which human beings are brains in vats whose mental
experiences, although qualitatively the same as in their normal lives,
are all caused by a supercomputer. The skeptic then argues that many
of the propositions about the external world that we take for granted
(such as “Trees are green”) are propositions that we
don’t know, since our evidence for such propositions is often
exactly the same as the evidence we would have in a vat-world in which
these propositions are false.

Hilary Putnam (1981) proposed an interesting and much discussed
attempt to refute a skeptical argument that is based on one form of
the brain-and-a-vat scenario. In turn, Putnam’s attempted
refutation is based on content externalism (also known as semantic
externalism). On this view, the referents and meanings of various
types of singular and general terms, as well as the propositions
expressed by sentences containing such terms, are determined by
aspects of the speaker’s external environment. In this entry, we
will consider the basic features of and problems with Putnam’s
original argument, and we will also present and discuss several of the
most important attempts to reconstruct or improve upon that
argument.

Franz Brentano,0.7214820384979248,0.4927011132240296,"


Franz Clemens Brentano (1838–1917) is mainly known for his work in
philosophy of psychology, especially for having introduced the notion
of intentionality to contemporary philosophy. He made important
contributions to many fields in philosophy, especially to metaphysics and ontology, ethics,
logic, the history of philosophy, and philosophical
theology. Brentano was strongly influenced by Aristotle and the
Scholastics as well as by the empiricist and positivist movements
of the early nineteenth century. Due to his introspectionist approach
of describing consciousness from a first person point of view, on one
hand, and his rigorous style as well as his contention that philosophy
should be done with exact methods like the natural sciences, on the other,
Brentano is often considered a forerunner of both the phenomenological
movement and the tradition of analytic philosophy. A charismatic
teacher, Brentano exerted a strong influence on the work of Edmund
Husserl, Alexius Meinong, Christian von Ehrenfels, Kasimir Twardowski, Carl Stumpf,
and Anton Marty, among others, and thereby played a central role in the
philosophical development of central Europe in the early twentieth
century.

Brentano's Theory of Judgement,0.7213746905326843,0.4945723116397858,"


One of Brentano's foremost aims in philosophy was to provide a new
foundation for epistemology and logic as two closely related
disciplines. He tried to achieve this by a systematic analysis of the
mental phenomena involved in attaining knowledge and in drawing
inferences. For Brentano knowledge is reached by judgements that are
directly or indirectly evident, and logical inferences contribute
to our knowledge because they can make a judgement indirectly evident
for us. Hence both epistemology and logic rely on a conception of
judgements, how they differ from other mental phenomena, and how they
are related to each other.


Brentano's view of the nature of judgement differs significantly
from other views that can be found in Aristotle, Kant, or Frege. In
contrast to Aristotle, Brentano emphasizes the importance of
existential judgements with only one term, and claims that predicative
judgements are a special case of existential ones. In contrast to
Kant, he emphasizes the difference between presentations and
judgements, rejecting their unification in the single category
“thinking”. In contrast to Frege, he holds that judgements
do not require the existence of complete thoughts or propositions
which have to be grasped before a judgement is made. It is the
mental act of judging, not its object or content, which is the bearer
of truth-values. In view of these differences Brentano's theory of
judgement has been called existential (non-predicative),
idiogenetic (non-reductionist), and reistic
(non-propositional).


Today Brentano's theory does not have many adherents. The now dominant
view is that propositions or sentences are the objects of belief, and
that judgements occur when beliefs are acquired, manifested, or
changed. Logical inferences are then defined as relations between
propositions or sentences, abstracting from the mental attitudes that
go along with them. Although this anti-psychological approach is
widely accepted today, there is still an open question concerning the
order of explanation: Are beliefs and judgements true because
they are directed at true propositions, or should we say that
propositions (and sentences) are true because they express true
beliefs and judgements? Once this question is raised, Brentano's
theory of judgement remains an interesting alternative to the current
mainstream in logic and epistemology.

Charlie Dunbar Broad,0.786857008934021,0.5052328705787659,"


Charlie Dunbar Broad (1887–1971) was an English philosopher who for
the most part of his life was associated with Trinity College,
Cambridge. Broad’s early interests were in science and
mathematics. Despite being successful in these he came to believe that
he would never be a first-rate scientist, and turned to philosophy.
Broad’s interests were exceptionally wide-ranging. He devoted his
philosophical acuity to the mind-body problem, the nature of
perception, memory, introspection, and the unconscious, to the nature
of space, time and causation. He also wrote extensively on the
philosophy of probability and induction, ethics, the history of
philosophy and the philosophy of religion. The ample scope and scale of
Broad’s work is impressive In addition he nourished an interest
in parapsychology—a subject he approached with the
disinterested curiosity and scrupulous care that is characteristic of
his philosophical work.


Broad did not have “a philosophy”—if by that
phrase is meant highly original philosophical theories, and a highly
original way of approaching philosophical problems. He writes: “I
have nothing worth calling a system of philosophy of my own, and there
is no philosopher of whom I should be willing to reckon myself a
faithful follower” (1924, p. 77). The reader is nonetheless
likely to reap philosophical insights from Broad’s manner of
meticulously setting out and carefully assessing the theories that
prima facie provide solutions to a given philosophical
problem. This feature of his writings is aptly described by A. J. Ayer:
“The subject is discussed from every angle, the various
possibilities judiciously set out, the precedents cited, the fallacious
arguments exposed: nothing is skimped: looking for reason, we are not
fobbed off with rhetoric” (Part of my Life, 1977, pp.
117–8). Broad combines fairness, astuteness as well as rare powers of
observation.


Philosophers who influenced Broad were (apart from the great
philosophers of the past) his teachers at Cambridge, Russell and Moore,
and J. M. E. McTaggart and W. E. Johnson; at St. Andrew’s he
received important additional influence from G. F. Stout and A. E.
Taylor. The diversity of their thought is mirrored in Broad’s own
exceptional range of interests.


Broad led a relatively uneventful life—“not unlike,”
he says in his “Autobiography,” “that of a monk in a
monastery” (1959b, p. 67). He hadn’t been out of the British
Isles until 1946 when he visited Sweden—a country he “fell
in love with,” and returned to nearly every year. On a
professional level he made acquaintances with several Swedish
philosophers (such as Konrad-Marc Wogau at Uppsala University).  In
the academic year 1953–4 Broad visited the University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor and the University of California at Los
Angeles. He writes with great warmth of the “kindness and
hospitality” with which he was received, and adds with
characteristic modesty: “It was good fun to be treated as a
great philosopher” (1959b). Broad was a homosexual, and never
married.

Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer,0.9194841980934144,0.8136301636695862,"


Dutch mathematician and philosopher who lived from 1881 to 1966. He is
traditionally referred to as “L.E.J. Brouwer”, with full
initials, but was called “Bertus” by his friends. 



In classical mathematics, he founded modern topology by
establishing, for example, the topological invariance of dimension and
the fixpoint theorem. He also gave the first correct definition of
dimension.


In philosophy, his brainchild is intuitionism, a revisionist
foundation of mathematics. Intuitionism views mathematics as a free
activity of the mind, independent of any language or Platonic realm of
objects, and therefore bases mathematics on a philosophy of mind. The
implications are twofold. First, it leads to a form of constructive
mathematics, in which large parts of classical mathematics are
rejected. Second, the reliance on a philosophy of mind introduces
features that are absent from classical mathematics as well as from
other forms of constructive mathematics: unlike those, intuitionistic
mathematics is not a proper part of classical mathematics.

Giordano Bruno,0.5879295468330383,0.2287916839122772,"

Giordano Bruno (1548–1600) was one of the most adventurous
thinkers of the Renaissance. Supremely confident in his intellectual
abilities, he ridiculed Aristotelianism, especially its contemporary
adherents. Copernicus’s heliocentric theory provided a starting
point for his exposition of what he called a “new
philosophy”. It disproved the axioms of Aristotelian natural
philosophy, notably the idea that sublunary elements occupied or
strove to return to their natural places, that is, the elemental
spheres, at the center of the cosmos. Concomitantly, it disproved the
existence of a superlunary region composed entirely of incorruptible
aether circling the earth and hence disproved Aristotle’s
principal argument for supposing that the universe was finite. The
universe was infinite, animate and populated by numberless solar
systems. It was also eternal. As such, it exhibited all possibilities
at any given moment, and all parts of it assumed all possibilities
over time, thereby constituting a cognizable manifestation of a
timeless and absolute principle, God, conceived as the sole being who
truly existed. In keeping with these ideas, Bruno proposed versions of
metempsychosis, polygenism, panpsychism and, renouncing Christian
emphases on human imperfection, advocated a morality that exhorted
individuals to perfect their intellectual powers.

translator, and political activist whose writings—mostly in
German and Hebrew—ranged from Jewish mysticism to social
philosophy, biblical studies, religious phenomenology, philosophical
anthropology, education, politics, and art. Most famous among his
philosophical writings is the short but powerful book I and
Thou (1923) where our relation to others is considered as
twofold.  The I-it relation prevails between subjects and
objects of thought and action; the I-Thou relation, on the
other hand, obtains in encounters between subjects that exceed the
range of the Cartesian subject-object relation. Though originally
planned as a prolegomenon to a phenomenology of religion, I and
Thou proved influential in other areas as well, including the
philosophy of education. The work of Martin Buber remains a linchpin
of qualitative philosophical anthropology and continues to be cited in
fields such as philosophical psychology, medical anthropology, and
pedagogical theory.  Buber's writings on Jewish national
renaissance, Hasidism, and political philosophy also made him a major

Ethics in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism,0.4425021409988403,0.37307831645011896,"

Buddhism represents a vast and rich intellectual tradition which,
until recently, received very little influence from Western
philosophy. This tradition contains a variety of teachings about how
to live and what to do in various situations. Buddhism tells us to
purify our own minds and to develop lovingkindness and compassion for
all beings. The various forms of Buddhism offer systematic frameworks
for understanding the traits of character and types of actions that
cause problems for ourselves and others, as well as those qualities
and actions that help to heal the suffering of the world. When
starting a Buddhist path, one agrees to follow rules of moral
discipline that forbid various destructive actions; but once the mind
has reached a very high degree of spiritual development, the rules are
transcended and one acts spontaneously for the benefit of others.

Buddhism upholds lofty and demanding ethical values, but recognizes
the need to adapt those values to the conditions of the real world.
From a Buddhist point of view, animal life is precious, and human life
is even more so. Ideally we should refrain from killing animals, adopt
a vegetarian diet, renounce all forms of violence and live in harmony
with nature. Yet there are some difficult cases in which violence and
killing seem almost unavoidable. Some Buddhist writers have offered
guidance on how to act appropriately and realistically in such
situations, without abandoning the compassion and lovingkindness that
form the basis of the Buddhist approach to ethics.

Mind in Indian Buddhist Philosophy,0.7299749255180359,0.34485962986946106,"


Perhaps no other classical philosophical tradition, East or West, 
offers a more complex and counter-intuitive account of mind and 
mental phenomena than Buddhism. While Buddhists share with other 
Indian philosophers the view that the domain of the mental 
encompasses a set of interrelated faculties and processes, they do 
not associate mental phenomena with the activity of a substantial, 
independent, and enduring self or agent. Rather, Buddhist theories of
mind center on the doctrine of
 not-self[1]
 (Pāli anatta, 
 Skt.[2]
anātma), which postulates that human beings are 
reducible to the physical and psychological constituents and 
processes which comprise them.


Indian Buddhist analyses of the mind span a period of some fifteen
centuries, from the earliest discourses of the Buddha (ca. 450 B.C.E.)
to the systematic developments of late Mahāyāna Buddhism
(500–1000 C.E.). Although philosophical accounts of mind emerge
only within the Abhidharma scholastic traditions (roughly 150
B.C.E. to 450 C.E.), their roots are found in the Buddha's teachings
of the not-self doctrine. At the same time, these accounts parallel
similar theoretical developments within the Brahmanical traditions,
with which they share a common philosophical vocabulary (and a general
view of mental processes as hierarchical and discrete). This article
focuses on the picture of mind and mental phenomena that emerges from
the canonical literature, the theories of mind advanced by the main
Abhidharma scholastic traditions, and the epistemological issues of
perception and intentionality debated by philosophers such as
Vasubandhu, Dignāga, Dharmakīrti, Candrakīrti,
Śāntarakṣita, and Dharmottara.


All references to the canonical literature are to the major 
collections of texts in the Pāli Canon, primarily to the 
Long, Middle, and Connected Discourses of 
the Buddha (the Dīgha, Majjhima, and 
Saṃyutta Nikāyas respectively). For the
Abhidharmic account of mind and related phenomena I draw almost
exclusively from Vasubandhu's Treasury of Higher Knowledge
(Abhidharmakośa and its bhāṣya;

developments of late Indian Buddhism. For other frequently quoted

Japanese Zen Buddhist Philosophy,0.6059889793395996,0.4233128130435944,"


Zen aims at a perfection of personhood. To this end, sitting
meditation called “za-zen” is employed as a
foundational method of prāxis across the different
schools of this Buddha-Way, through which the Zen practitioner
attempts to embody non-discriminatory wisdom vis-à-vis
the meditational experience known as “satori”
(enlightenment). A process of discovering wisdom culminates in the
experiential dimension in which the equality of thing-events is
apprehended in discerning them.  The most distinguishing feature of
this school of the Buddha-Way is seen in its contention that wisdom,
accompanied by compassion, is expressed in the everyday
“life-world” when associating with one’s self, people, and
nature. The everyday “life-world” for most people is an
evanescent transforming stage in which living is consumed,
philosophically speaking, by an either-or, ego-logical, dualistic
paradigm of thinking with its attendant psychological states such as
stress and anxiety. Zen demands an overcoming of this paradigm by
practically achieving an holistic perspective in cognition, so that
the Zen practitioner can celebrate, with a stillness of mind, a life
of tending toward the concrete thing-events of everyday life and
nature. For this reason, the Zen practitioner is required to embody
freedom expressive of the original human nature. Generally speaking,
Zen cherishes simplicity and straightforwardness in grasping reality
and acting on it “here and now,” for it believes that a
thing-event that is immediately presencing before one’s eyes
or under one’s foot is no other than an expression of suchness, i.e.,
it is such that it is showing its primordial mode of
being. It also understands a specificity of thing-event to be
a recapitulation of the whole; parts and the whole are to be lived in
an inseparable relationship through an exercise of nondiscriminatory
wisdom, without prioritizing the visible over the invisible, the
explicit over the implicit, and vice versa. As such, Zen maintains a
stance of “not one” and “not two,”
i.e., “positionless position,” where “not
two” signals a negation of the stance that divides the whole
into two parts, i.e., dualism, while “not one”
designates a negation of this stance when the Zen practitioner dwells
in the whole as one, while suspending judgment in meditation,
i.e., non-dualism. Free, bilateral movement between
“not one” and “not two” characterizes Zen’s
achievement of a personhood with a third perspective that
cannot, however, be confined to either dualism or non-dualism
(i.e., neither “not one” nor “not
two”).

(Japanese: Zen; Korean: Sôn; Vietnamese; Thiền). Although
the Sinograph “chan” (禪) transliterates the
Sanskrit dhyāna or “meditation”,
and Chan zong can thus be translated as the “Meditation
School”, Chan was not distinctive within Chinese Buddhism in its
use of meditative techniques. What distinguished Chan were its novel
use of language, its development of new narrative forms, and its
valorization of the direct and embodied realization of Buddhist
awakening. In contrast with the epistemic, hermeneutical and
metaphysical concerns that shaped other schools of Chinese Buddhism,
Chan’s defining concerns were experiential and
relational—concerns that fit most comfortably, perhaps, within
the horizons of philosophical anthropology. Appreciating the
philosophical dimensions of Chan thus requires some familiarity with
Buddhist thought and practice, and the dynamics of their infusion into
Chinese culture.

Tiantai Buddhism,0.4465478360652924,0.3494261205196381,"
Tiantai is the name of a mountain and surrounding geographical
location in China, literally meaning “platform of the
sky”, but the term is traditionally used to denote a particular
school of Mahāyāna Buddhism with historical connections to that
locale. In this article, the term “Tiantai” will be used
to refer to the philosophical ideas developed from the sixth to
eleventh centuries by this school, as expounded in the writings of its
three most representative figures: Tiantai Zhiyi (538–597),
Jingxi Zhanran (711–782) and Siming Zhili (960–1028).
To translate Tiantai’s rather technical scholastic terminology and
its typically Buddhist soteriological orientation into something
approaching traditional philosophical categories, we can start by
identifying a few hashtag themes that are characteristic of Tiantai
thinking. Tiantai is: a thoroughgoing contextualism, a thoroughgoing
holism, a thoroughgoing monism, and a theory of absolute immanence. It
asserts an exceptionless impermanence, exceptionless
anti-substantialism, and exceptionless ambiguity of identity for all
finite and conditional entities. Epistemologically this entails
thoroughgoing skepticism about all unconditional claims, and
thoroughgoing anti-realism. Ethically it implies a thoroughgoing
renunciation of all finite aims, as well as thoroughgoing repudiation
of all determinate moral rules, moral consequences, and moral
virtues. 
But our understanding of each of these points must be thoroughly
modified by the most characteristic premise of Tiantai thought of all,
which determines the meaning we intend for the term “
thoroughgoing” here: the idea of
“self-recontextualization”, whereby the full expression of
any element of experience, indeed of any determinate entity at all,
intrinsically entails its self-overcoming. This turn of thought may be
termed dialectical, but in a way that differs from both
Hegelian and Marxian notions of dialectics in that it is neither
teleologically progressive nor hierarchical. It has roots in 1)
indigenous Chinese interest in the “reversals” observed in
the cycles of nature, conceptualized according to the naïve
ancient generalization that when anything is pushed its own extreme it
will “reverse”, that an increase in a thing’s extension or
intensity leads to its self-undermining (e,g., it keeps getting colder
until it gets coldest, and then it starts getting warmer), and in 2)
the sophisticated ruminations on the nature of conditionality
developed in the Emptiness and Two Truths doctrines as expressed in
Indian Buddhist logic. What this means is that “thoroughgoing
contextualism” will in Tiantai reverse into an
assertion of the self-validation of every entity without exception,
that “thoroughgoing holism” will in Tiantai self-reverse
also into thoroughgoing individualism, “thoroughgoing
monism” also into thoroughgoing pluralism, “thoroughgoing
immanentism” also into thoroughgoing transcendentalism, along
with a claim that these two extremes are, when fully thought through,
actually synonyms for one another. It will mean that for all finite
conditional entities, exceptionless impermanence is seen to be also
exceptionless eternalism, exceptionless anti-substantialism is seen to
be also exceptionless substantialism, exceptionless anti-realism is
seen to be also exceptionless realism, again supplemented by a claim
about the interchangeability of these two seemingly opposed
claims. Similarly, thoroughgoing skepticism about all claims is seen
to be also a thoroughgoing “trivialism” (the claim that
all possible claims are true), thoroughgoing anti-realism also a
fanatically absolute realism even for the most fleeting appearances,
thoroughgoing renunciation of finite aims, moral rules, moral
consequences and moral virtues is seen to be also an exceptionless
acceptance of all finite aims and the endorsement of all determinate
moral rules, consequences and virtues. 
When the dust from these turnarounds settles, Tiantai ends up with
a unique view of the structure of reality: every event, function or
characteristic occurring in any experience anywhere is the action of
all sentient and insentient beings working together. Every instant of
experience is the whole of reality manifesting in this particular
form, as this particular entity or experience. Each such
instant is however no mere accidental, dispensable form; rather, it is
itself unconditional and ineradicable, is eternal and omnipresent.
Moreover, this “whole of reality” is irreducibly multiple
and irreducibly unified at once, in the following way: all possible
conflicting, contrasted and axiologically varied aspects are
irrevocably present—in the sense of
“findable”—in and as each of these individual
determinate totality-effects. Good and evil, delusion and
enlightenment, Buddhahood and deviltry, are all “inherently
entailed” in each and every event. These multiple entities are
not “simply located” even virtually or conceptually: the
“whole” which is the agent performing every experience is
not a collection of these various “inherently entailed”
entities or qualities arrayed side by side, like coins in a pocket.
Rather, they are “intersubsumptive”. That is, any one of
them subsumes all the others, and yet, because of the view of what
“subsumption” actually is, each is subsumed by each of the
others as well: all relation is subsumption, and all subsumption is
intersubsumption. Each part is the whole, each quality subsumes all
other qualities, and yet none are ever eradicable. A Buddha in the
world makes the world all Buddha, saturated in every locus with the
quality “Buddhahood”; a devil in the world makes the world
all devil, permeated with “deviltry”. Both Buddha and
devil are always in the world. So every event in the world is always
both entirely Buddhahood and entirely
deviltry. Every moment of experience is always completely delusion,
evil and pain, through and through, and also completely enlightenment,
goodness and joy, through and through. 
Traditional Buddhism gives a rather commonsensical account of
sentient experience: every moment of sentient experience is a sensory
apparatus encountering an object, giving rise thereby to a particular
moment of contentful awareness. But in the Tiantai view, each of these
three—sense organ, object, this moment of consciousness—is
itself the Absolute, the entirety of reality, expressed without
remainder in the peculiar temporary form of sense organ, of object, of
this consciousness. Hence each moment of every being’s experience is
redescribed, to paraphrase a canonical early Tiantai work, as follows:
The absolute totality encounters the absolute
totality, and the result is the arising of the absolute
totality. (法界對法界起法界)
The Absolute, the whole of reality, is one and
eternal, always the same and omnipresent, but it is also the kind of
whole that divides from itself, encounters itself, arises anew each
moment, engenders itself as the transient flux of each unique
and individual moment of experience of every sentient being.
 How this view is established, and what its consequences are, is
what is to be explained in this article.

Perhaps the most influential Parisian philosopher of the fourteenth
century, John Buridan did much to shape the way philosophy was done
not only during his own lifetime, but throughout the later scholastic
and early modern periods.  He spent his entire career as a teaching
master in the arts faculty at the University of Paris, lecturing on
logic and the works of Aristotle, and producing many commentaries and
independent treatises on logic, metaphysics, natural philosophy, and
ethics. His most famous work is the Summulae de dialectica
(Compendium of Dialectic), a text of astonishing breadth and
originality aimed at redeeming the older tradition of Aristotelian
logic using the newer, terminist logic of ‘moderns’ such
as Peter of Spain and William of Ockham.  Buridan applied these
analytical techniques so successfully in his metaphysics, natural
philosophy, and ethics that, for many of his successors, they came to be
identified with the method of philosophy, understood as
a secular practice, i.e., as distinct from theology.

Walter Burley, or Burleigh, (ca. 1275–1344) was one of the most
prominent and influential philosophers of the fourteenth century. He
had a very long career in both England and France, becoming Master of
Arts at Oxford by 1301 and Master of Theology at Paris by 1324. He
produced a large body of about fifty works, many of which were widely
read in the later Middle Ages. Especially prominent were his last
commentaries on the Ars Vetus and Physics, which
were studied all over Europe and particularly at Italian universities
during the latter half of the fourteenth and the whole of the
fifteenth centuries. His semantic and ontological views evolved during
his career in response to Ockham’s acute criticism of traditional
realism, moving from the moderate realism typical of
thirteenth-century theologians such as Thomas Aquinas and Henry of
Ghent to the extreme realism of his later writings, which posit the
existence of extramental universals really distinct from individual
things, extramental propositions as significates of true sentences,
and real distinctions among the ten categories. According to Burley,
all of this is necessary to preserve the validity of our knowledge of
the external world, which he believed can be made evident without
falling prey to Ockham’s criticisms.

Joseph Butler's Moral Philosophy,0.5108155608177185,0.6066374182701111,"


Joseph Butler is best known for his criticisms of the hedonic and
egoistic “selfish” theories associated with Hobbes and
Bernard Mandeville and for his positive arguments that self-love and
conscience are not at odds if properly understood (and indeed promote
and sanction the same actions). In addition to his importance as a
moral philosopher Butler was also an influential Anglican theologian.
Unsurprisingly his theology and philosophy were connected — his
main writings in moral philosophy were published sermons, a work of
natural theology, and a brief dissertation attached to that work.
Although most of Butler’s moral arguments make rich use of passages
from scripture and familiar Christian stories and concepts, they make
little reference to — and depend little on the reader having
— any particular religious commitments. Indeed many of his
arguments do not rest on the reader having any religious commitments
at all. His Analogy of Religion was aimed to convince deists
of the truth of core doctrines of natural and revealed theology but
the argument only assumes the premises Butler shared with them. This
has led to his philosophy being of interest to both secular and
Christian moralists, and to debate as to how much and what of his
ethics rests on his Christian commitments.

Byzantine Philosophy,0.6411222815513611,0.1194995418190956,"


For the purposes of this article, Byzantine philosophy is the study
and teaching of traditional subjects of philosophy in the Greek
language between c. 730 and 1453. The second half of this delineation
construes the attribute “Byzantine” rather narrowly, in
that it excludes the whole period between c. 330 and c. 730, which is
commonly referred to by historians as “Early Byzantine”
(and also leaves out of account philosophical activity in the minority
languages of the Byzantine Empire). The main reason for focusing on
the philosophical works after c. 730 is that Early Byzantine
philosophy is usually covered in accounts of late Ancient Philosophy,
of which it is a seamless continuation. The first half of the
delineation should not be taken to imply any particular view regarding
the “true face of Byzantine philosophy”, although we do
think that it is by being related in certain ways to the philosophical
tradition that a written work is eligible to be classed as
philosophical. This tradition was formed in antiquity. Hence, the
works discussed here will typically be concerned with questions
inherited from ancient philosophy.


We have tried to impose a provisional borderline between Byzantine
philosophy and other areas which are so closely related to Byzantine
philosophy as to be sometimes inseparable from it. Most importantly,
we have tried to demarcate our subject matter from that of Byzantine
theology, not because we believe that an account in which the
religious dimension is largely ignored will be sufficient to grasp
Byzantine intellectual history in its organic entirety, but because we
think that a clearer conception of the “purely”
philosophical part of Byzantine intellectual history is both desirable
in itself and necessary for the understanding of the whole. This may
seem to lead us straight towards an episodic account, concentrating on
a few solitary thinkers on the fringe of Byzantine intellectual
history. In order to avoid this we have chosen not to place very heavy
demands on the originality of the works to be included. Our main
concern has been to describe the typical features of the philosophical
tradition in Byzantium, rather than to highlight the rare instances
when innovative views and arguments were put forward.


The main part of the article is divided into two sections. Section
1 attempts to situate Byzantine philosophy in the general context of
Byzantine culture and education, and to give a brief survey of the more
important philosophical authors and their works. For Section 2, we have
made a selection of two especially significant topics in the fields of
natural philosophy and metaphysics. This arrangement allows us to look
a bit more closely at the form and content of some Byzantine
philosophical views and arguments without giving up the ambition to be
reasonably historically comprehensive.

Callicles and Thrasymachus,0.5211043953895569,0.2959529459476471,"

Callicles and Thrasymachus are the two great exemplars in philosophy
of contemptuous challenge to conventional morality. Both are
characters in Platonic dialogues, in the Gorgias and Book I
of the Republic respectively; both denounce the virtue of
justice, dikaiosunê, as an artificial brake on
self-interest, a fraud to be seen through by intelligent people.
Together, Thrasymachus and Callicles have fallen into the folk
mythology of moral philosophy as ‘the immoralist’ (or
‘amoralist’). These are perhaps not quite the right words,
but it is useful to have a label for their common 
challenge—more generally, for the figure who demands a good reason to abide by
moral constraints, and denies, implicitly or explicitly, that this
demand can be
 met.[1]
 Because of this shared agenda, and because Socrates’ refutation
of Callicles can be read as an unsatisfying rehearsal for the
Republic, it is tempting to assume that the two share a
single philosophical position. But in fact Callicles and Thrasymachus
are by no means interchangeable; and the differences between them are
important both for the interpretation of Plato and philosophically,
for our understanding of the varieties of immoralism and the
motivations behind it. This article discusses both the common
challenge presented by these two figures and the features which
separate them, treating them strictly as players in Plato’s
philosophical dramas. (Thrasymachus was a real person, a famous
diplomat and orator of whose real views we know only a little; of
Callicles we know nothing, and he may even be Plato’s
 invention.)[2]
 It will also compare them to a third Platonic version of the
immoralist challenge, the one presented by Glaucon and Adeimantus in
Republic Book II, and to the writings of sophist 
Antiphon—the best-known real-life counterpart of all three Platonic
views, and perhaps their historical original. Certain aspects of
Plato’s own arguments against immoralism will also be discussed,
insofar as they help to clarify what Callicles and Thrasymachus
themselves have to say.

The Cambridge Platonists,0.5977585315704346,0.30525436997413635,"


The Cambridge Platonists were a group of English seventeenth-century
thinkers associated with the University of Cambridge. The most
important philosophers among them were
 Henry More
(1614–1687) and
 Ralph Cudworth
 (1617–1688),
both fellows of Christ's College, Cambridge. The group also included
 Benjamin Whichcote
 (1609–1683),
 Peter Sterry
 (1613–1672),
 John Smith
 (1618–1652),
 Nathaniel Culverwell
 (1619–1651), John
Worthington (1618–1671), all one-time fellows of Emmanuel College,
Cambridge. Their younger followers included George Rust (d. 1670),
 Anne Conway
(1630–1679) and John Norris (1657–1711). In so far as they all held
the philosophy of Plato and Plotinus in high regard, the designation
‘Platonist’ is apt. However, they drew on a wide range of
philosophical sources besides Platonism. Among ancient philosophers,
they were well acquainted with Aristotle and with Stoicism. But they
were also very much abreast of new developments in philosophy and
science – with Descartes, Hobbes and Spinoza as well as Bacon, Boyle
and the Royal Society. (Smith, Culverwell, Cudworth and More were among
the first Englishmen to read Descartes). The framework within which
they read and understood ancient and modern philosophy was that of the
‘perennial philosophy’ (philosophia perennis)
proposed originally by Italian Renaissance philosophers such as
Marsilio Ficino, and Agostino Steucho, but also employed by Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz. Not only did they share the Renaissance Humanist
regard for the achievements of ancient philosophy, but like the
Humanists of the Renaissance, their interest was dictated by their
sense of the relevance of classical philosophy to contemporary life.
They also emphatically repudiated the scholasticism that prevailed in
academic philosophy and took a lively interest in the developments that
brought about the scientific revolution. They therefore form part of
the philosophical revolution of the seventeenth century, especially
since they sought an alternative philosophical foundation to
Aristotelianism which was waning fast in the face of challenges from
scepticism and competing alternative philosophies, notably those of
Hobbes and Descartes. They were the first philosophers to write
primarily and consistently in the English language.


One difference between the Cambridge Platonists and their more
famous philosophical contemporaries is that they all had a theological
background. Nevertheless, convinced of the compatibility of reason and
faith, they regarded philosophy as the legitimate concern of
theologians and are distinguished by the high value they accorded human
reason. They devoted their considerable philosophical learning to
religious and moral issues, to defending the existence of God and the
immortality of the soul, and to formulating a practical ethics for
Christian conduct. They held the eternal existence of moral principles
and of truth and that the human mind is equipped with the principles of
reason and morality. Their optimistic view of human nature is
underscored by their emphasis on the freedom of the will. Their
anti-determinism lead them to propose arguments for human autonomy.
They were all dualists for whom mind is ontologically prior to matter,
and for whom the truths of the mind are superior to sense-knowledge.
They were nevertheless moderns in natural philosophy who accepted
post-Galilean science, and propounded an atomistic theory of matter.
But they repudiated mechanistic natural philosophy in favour of the
view that spirit is the fundamental causal principle in the operations
of nature.

Albert Camus (1913–1960) was a journalist, editor and
editorialist, playwright and director, novelist and author of short
stories, political essayist and activist—and, although he more
than once denied it, a philosopher. He ignored or opposed systematic
philosophy, had little faith in rationalism, asserted rather than
argued many of his main ideas, presented others in metaphors, was
preoccupied with immediate and personal experience, and brooded over
such questions as the meaning of life in the face of death. Although
he forcefully separated himself from existentialism, Camus posed one
of the twentieth century’s best-known existentialist questions, which
launches The Myth of Sisyphus: “There is only one
really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide”
(MS, 3). And his philosophy of the absurd has left us with a
striking image of the human fate: Sisyphus endlessly pushing his rock
up the mountain only to see it roll back down each time he gains the
top. Camus’s philosophy found political expression in
The Rebel, which along with his newspaper editorials, 
political essays, plays, and fiction earned him a reputation as a 
great moralist. It also embroiled him in conflict with his friend,
Jean-Paul Sartre, provoking the major political-intellectual divide of
the Cold-War era as Camus and Sartre became, respectively, the leading
intellectual voices of the anti-Communist and pro-Communist left.
Furthermore, in posing and answering urgent philosophical questions of
the day, Camus articulated a critique of religion and of the
Enlightenment and all its projects, including Marxism. In 1957 he won 
the Nobel Prize for literature. He died in a car accident in January, 
1960, at the age of 46.

The Capability Approach,0.4862330555915833,0.7263566255569458,"

The capability approach is a theoretical framework that entails two
core normative claims: first, the claim that the freedom to achieve
well-being is of primary moral importance, and second, that freedom to
achieve well-being is to be understood in terms of people's
capabilities, that is, their real opportunities to do and be what they
have reason to value. The approach has been developed in a variety of
more specific normative theories, such as (partial) theories of social
justice or accounts of development ethics. It has also led to a new
and highly interdisciplinary literature in the social sciences
resulting in new statistics and social indicators, and to a new policy
paradigm which is mainly used in development studies, the so-called
‘human development approach’.

approach from a philosophical point of view. Readers who are

Ernst Cassirer occupies a unique place in twentieth-century
philosophy. His work pays equal attention to foundational and
epistemological issues in the philosophy of mathematics and natural
science and to aesthetics, the philosophy of history, and other issues
in the “cultural sciences” broadly conceived. More than any
other German philosopher since Kant, Cassirer thus aims to devote equal
philosophical attention both to the (mathematical and) natural sciences
(Naturwissenschaften) and to the more humanistic disciplines
(Geisteswissenschaften). In this way, Cassirer, more than any
other twentieth-century philosopher, plays a fundamental mediating role
between C. P. Snow’s famous “two cultures.” He also plays a
similarly mediating role between the two major traditions in
twentieth-century academic philosophy – the
“analytic” and “continental” traditions –
whose radically different (and often mutually uncomprehending)
perspectives on the relationship between scientific and humanistic
elements in their subject gave rise to a fundamental split or gulf
between philosophy as it came to be practiced in the Anglo-American
world, on the one side, and as it was practiced in most of the rest of
the world, on the other. Cassirer, by contrast, had fruitful
philosophical relations with leading members of both traditions –
with Moritz Schlick, the founder and guiding spirit of the Vienna
Circle of logical empiricists, whose work in logic and the philosophy
of science had a decisive influence on the development of philosophy in

Philosophical examination of moral reasoning faces both distinctive

with conflicts among them and about how they move us to act –
and distinctive opportunities for gleaning insight about what we ought
to do from how we reason about what we ought to do.

requires of us and to philosophical accounts of the metaphysics of
morality, and explains the interest of the topic. Part II then takes

Categories,0.7116705775260925,0.2660453021526337,"


A system of categories is a complete list of highest kinds or
genera. Traditionally, following Aristotle, these have been thought of
as highest genera of entities (in the widest sense of the term), so
that a system of categories undertaken in this realist spirit would
ideally provide an inventory of everything there is, thus answering
the most basic of metaphysical questions: “What is there?”
Skepticism about our ability to discern a unique system of basic
categories of ‘reality itself’ has led others to approach
category systems not with the aim of cataloging the highest kinds in
the world itself, but rather with the aim of elucidating the
categories of our conceptual system or language. Thus Kant makes the
shift to a conceptualist approach by drawing out the categories that
are a priori necessary for any possible cognition of
objects. Since such categories are guaranteed to apply to any possible
object of cognition, they retain a certain sort of ontological import,
although this application is limited to phenomena, not the thing in
itself. After Kant, it has been common to approach the project of
categories in a neutral spirit that Brian Carr (1987, 7) calls
“categorial descriptivism”, as describing the categorial
structure that the world would have
according to our thought, experience, or language, while
refraining from making commitments about whether or not these
categories are occupied, or are ontically fundamental. Edmund Husserl
approaches categories in something like this way, since he begins by
laying out categories of
meanings, which may then be used to draw out
ontological categories (categories of possible objects meant)
as the correlates of the meaning categories, without concern for any
empirical matter about whether or not there really are objects of the
various ontological categories discerned.


A system of ontological categories drawn out in any of these modes has
the potential for a great many uses in philosophy, but those who would
offer such systems of categories also face a variety of
difficulties. They must address the issue of what the proper methods
are by means of which categories are to be distinguished, how many
categories there are and what they are, whether or not there is a
single summum genus subsuming all other categories, and
whether we should distinguish a single system of categories or
multiple dimensions of categories – issues on which there has
been little agreement.


Over the past hundred years, skepticism about the possibility of
offering a uniquely true and complete system of ontological categories
has led discussion of categories to shift from attempts to offer
complete systems of categories to attempts merely to draw particular
distinctions, especially among our conceptual or linguistic categories.
Work on category differences, unlike that on category systems, does not
generally purport to answer deep metaphysical questions about what
things or kinds of things exist; instead, category differences are typically
articulated as a way of diagnosing and avoiding various philosophical
problems and confusions. Nonetheless, even those who merely argue for
category differences owe an account of the conditions under which two
concepts, terms, or objects belong to different categories.

Medieval Theories of the Categories,0.7120581865310669,0.2603350281715393,"


This entry is intended as a brief and general introduction to the
development of category theory from the beginning of the Middle Ages,
in the sixth century, to the Silver Age of Scholasticism, in the
sixteenth. This development is fascinating but extraordinarily
complex.  Scholars are just beginning to take note of the major
differences in the understanding of categories and of how these
differences are related to the discussion of other major philosophical
topics in the Middle Ages. Much work remains to be done, even
regarding the views of towering figures, so necessarily we have had to
restrict our discussion to only a few major figures and topics. Still,
we hope that the discussion will serve as a good starting point for
anyone interested in category theory and its history.

Category Theory,0.9328764081001282,0.7756614089012146,"


Category theory has come to occupy a central position in contemporary
mathematics and theoretical computer science, and is also applied to
mathematical physics. Roughly, it is a general mathematical theory of
structures and of systems of structures. As category theory is still
evolving, its functions are correspondingly developing, expanding and
multiplying. At minimum, it is a powerful language, or conceptual
framework, allowing us to see the universal components of a family of
structures of a given kind, and how structures of different kinds are
interrelated. Category theory is both an interesting object of
philosophical study, and a potentially powerful formal tool for
philosophical investigations of concepts such as space, system, and
even truth. It can be applied to the study of logical systems in which
case category theory is called “categorical doctrines” at the
syntactic, proof-theoretic, and semantic levels. Category theory is an
alternative to set theory as a foundation for mathematics. As such, it
raises many issues about mathematical ontology and epistemology.
Category theory thus affords philosophers and logicians much to use
and reflect upon.

Causal Determinism,0.8727298378944397,0.4575033485889435,"

Causal determinism is, roughly speaking, the idea that every event is
necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the
laws of nature. The idea is ancient, but first became subject to
clarification and mathematical analysis in the eighteenth century.
Determinism is deeply connected with our understanding of the physical
sciences and their explanatory ambitions, on the one hand, and with
our views about human free action on the other. In both of these
general areas there is no agreement over whether determinism is true
(or even whether it can be known true or false), and what the import
for human agency would be in either case.

Causal Models,0.9462345242500304,0.4470994174480438,"

Causal models are mathematical models representing causal
relationships within an individual system or population. They
facilitate inferences about causal relationships from statistical
data. They can teach us a good deal about the epistemology of
causation, and about the relationship between causation and
probability. They have also been applied to topics of interest to
philosophers, such as the logic of counterfactuals, decision theory,
and the analysis of actual causation.

Backward Causation,0.9291050434112548,0.43452122807502747,"
Sometimes also called retro-causation. A common feature of our world
seems to be that in all cases of causation, the cause and the effect
are placed in time so that the cause precedes its effect temporally.
Our normal understanding of causation assumes this feature to such a
degree that we intuitively have great difficulty imagining things
differently. The notion of backward causation, however, stands for the
idea that the temporal order of cause and effect is a mere contingent
feature and that there may be cases where the cause is causally prior
to its effect but where the temporal order of the cause and effect is
reversed with respect to normal causation, i.e., there may be cases
where the effect temporally, but not causally, precedes its cause.
The idea of backward causation should not be confused with that of
time travel. These two notions are related to the extent that both
agree that it is possible to causally affect the past. The difference,
however, is that time travel involves a causal loop whereas backward
causation does not. Causal loops for their part can only occur in a
universe in which one has closed time-like curves. In contrast,
backward causation may take place in a world where there are no such
closed time-like curves. In other words, an ordinary system \(S\)
taking part in time travel would preserve the temporal order of its
proper time during its travel, it would keep the same time sense during
its entire flight (a watch measuring \(S\)’s proper time would
keep moving clockwise); but if the same system \(S\) were to
become involved in a process of backward causation, the order of its
proper time would have to reverse in the sense that the time sense of
the system would become opposite of what it was before its back-in-time
travel (the watch will start to move counter-clockwise). So neither
backward causation nor time travel logically entails each other and
time travel is distinct from back-in-time travel.

Counterfactual Theories of Causation,0.9401708245277404,0.44596871733665466,"


The basic idea of counterfactual theories of causation is that the
meaning of causal claims can be explained in terms of counterfactual
conditionals of the form “If A had not
occurred, C would not have occurred”. While
counterfactual analyses have been given of type-causal concepts, most
counterfactual analyses have focused on singular causal or
token-causal claims of the form “event c caused
event e”. Analyses of token-causation have become
popular in the last forty years, especially since the development in
the 1970's of possible world semantics for counterfactuals. The best
known counterfactual analysis of causation is David Lewis's (1973b)
theory. However, intense discussion over forty years has cast doubt on
the adequacy of any simple analysis of singular causation in terms of
counterfactuals. Recent years have seen a proliferation of different
refinements of the basic idea to achieve a closer match with
commonsense judgements about causation.

Causation in Arabic and Islamic Thought,0.6111769676208496,0.13700290024280548,"
In the classical period of Arabic and Islamic thought
(9th–12th centuries), original and
influential accounts of causation emerged from debate within two
intellectual traditions: speculative theology (kalām)
and Greek philosophy (falsafah). Among the theologians
(mutakallimūn), dispute about the distribution of agency
and causal power played a role in the interpretation of revealed
accounts of God and his relationship to the world. By contrast, the
philosophers (falāsifah) saw themselves as developing a
rationalist science begun by Aristotle. In this tradition, to know a
thing is to know its causes. Discovery of the nature of causation is
regarded as fundamental to science.
In the classical period, at least, theology and philosophy
developed separately. Indeed, philosophy’s independence from
theology in this period is striking as compared to its subordinate
status as the handmaid of theology in the Medieval Latin
West. Nevertheless, debate across theology and philosophy contributed
to the development of both traditions. Especially fruitful for the
philosophy of causation were attacks on Aristotelian natural
philosophy by Ashʿarite theologians. These attacks employed
arguments that reappear in Early Modern causality debates.

The basic questions dealt with in this entry are: (i) whether and to
what extent causation in legal contexts differs from causation outside
the law, for example in science or everyday life, and (ii) what are the
appropriate criteria in law for deciding whether one action or event
has caused another, (generally harmful) event. The importance of these
questions is that responsibility in law very often depends on showing
that a specific action or event or state of affairs has caused specific
harm or loss to another. Are the criteria adopted in deciding these
causal issues both objective and properly attuned to the function of
fixing responsibility? 



The entry covers the nature and functions of causation, the relation
between causation and legal responsibility, and the criteria for the
existence of causal connection in law. The last topic is treated in two
parts: what are causally relevant conditions
(‘causes-in-fact‘) and what are the grounds for limiting
responsibility (the ‘proximate cause’ requirement).

Causation and Manipulability,0.9376063942909241,0.4545385837554932,"

Manipulability theories of causation, according to which causes are to
be regarded as handles or devices for manipulating effects, have
considerable intuitive appeal and are popular among social scientists
and statisticians. This article surveys several prominent versions of
such theories advocated by philosophers, and the many difficulties
they face. Philosophical statements of the manipulationist approach
are generally reductionist in aspiration and assign a central role to
human action. These contrast with recent discussions employing a
broadly manipulationist framework for understanding causation, such as
those due to the computer scientist Judea Pearl and others, which are
non-reductionist and rely instead on the notion of an intervention.
This is simply an appropriately exogenous causal process; it has no
essential connection with human action. This interventionist framework
manages to avoid at least some of these difficulties faced by
traditional philosophical versions of the manipulability theory and
helps to clarify the content of causal claims.

Medieval Theories of Causation,0.7282052636146545,0.13833382725715634,"

Causality plays an important role in medieval philosophical writing:
the dominant genre of medieval academic writing was the commentary on
an authoritative work, very often a work of Aristotle. Of the works of
Aristotle thus commented on, the Physics plays a central
role.  Other of Aristotle’s scientific works – On the
Heavens and the Earth, On Generation and Corruption,
and, of course, the Metaphysics – are also significant
for the study of causation: so there is a rather daunting body of work
to survey. 

One might, though, be tempted to argue that this concentration on
causality is simply an effect of reading Aristotle, but this would be
too hasty. Medieval thinkers were attracted to the problem of
causality long before most of Aristotle’s texts became available
in the thirteenth century: already in the twelfth century the created
universe was seen as a rational manifestation of God (Wetherbee 1988,
p. 25), and, consequently, the rational investigation of the universe
was seen as a way of approaching God: “In the creation of
things”, says William of Conches, “divine power, wisdom
and goodness are beheld” (William of Conches, Glosa super
Platonem, p. 60). This consideration of the relation between the
natural world and God continues throughout the Middle Ages: for
example, Duns Scotus’ proof of the existence of God is an a
posteriori modal proof, based on the notion of causality (Craig
1980; Normore 2003; Ross and Bates 2003).

Thus, apart from direct literary influence, the nature of the
philosophical and theological themes which were popular in the Middle
Ages also led to an emphasis on causality. Writers studied the
interrelationship of divine grace and natural processes, the role of
the will in ethics, free will and determinism: all of these problems
have an important causal component.  Similarly, they investigated the
nature of the causal processes involved in human and animal
perception.  These questions were often handled by methods which might
seem to us to be extraordinarily naturalistic – naturalistic, of
course, in the sense of the modes of natural investigation which were
current at the time. It comes as no surprise to know that many
medieval thinkers discussed the question of whether divine grace can
increase: what is surprising is that many of the discussions
use the technical tools of Aristotle’s physical and biological
works, tools which were originally developed to discuss problems of
continuity and change in the natural world.  What is even more
surprising is the technical proficiency of many of these discussions:
fourteenth-century work on this topic gave rise to very acute analyses
of the variation of continuous quantities (see Murdoch 1975), and this
study of continuous variation played an important role in the
development of the calculus.


What should become evident during this survey is the extremely tight
and complex interconnection between medieval causal theories and
medieval ontology. After Aristotle’s texts had been assimilated,
almost all medieval academic theories had an ontology which was
basically hylomorphic: substances were composites of matter and form,
and change was described as the loss of one form and the acquisition
of another.  Form was not merely shape, but an active principle: the
form of a thing was responsible for its causal role (White 1984; Goddu
1999, p. 148).  Furthermore, in any causal interaction, the allocation
of active and passive roles to the individuals involved tended to be
thought of as unproblematic. Although many aspects of Aristotle’s
causal theories were extensively and critically debated, this basic
hylomorphism persisted throughout; and it is this, rather than
anything more arcane, which often poses the greatest problems in
assimilating, or evaluating, medieval thought on these topics.

Questions about the existence and nature of mental causation are
prominent in contemporary discussions of the mind and human
agency. Originally, the problem of mental causation was that of
understanding how an immaterial mind, a soul, could interact with the
body. Most philosophers nowadays repudiate souls, but the problem of
mental causation has not gone away. Instead, focus has shifted to
mental properties. How could mental properties be causally
relevant to bodily behavior? How could something mental
qua mental cause what it does? After looking at the

What must a world be like, to host causal relations? When the cue ball
knocks the nine ball into the corner pocket, in virtue of what is this
a case of causation?

Questions about the metaphysics of causation may be usefully divided
into questions about the causal relata, and questions about the causal
relation. Questions about the causal relata include the questions of
(1.1) whether they are in spacetime (immanence), (1.2) how
fine-grained they are (individuation), and (1.3) how many
there are (adicity). Questions about the causal relation
include the questions of (2.1) how causally related and causally
unrelated sequences differ (connection), (2.2) how sequences
related as cause to effect differ from those related as effect to
cause or as joint effects of a common cause (direction), and
(2.3) how if at all sequences involving causes differ from those
involving mere background conditions (selection).

Philosophers have, of course, disagreed over all of these questions.

Margaret Lucas Cavendish,0.6373078227043152,0.3430422842502594,"

Margaret Lucas Cavendish was a philosopher, poet, scientist,
fiction-writer, and playwright who lived in the Seventeenth Century.
Her work is important for a number of reasons. One is that it lays out
an early and very compelling version of the naturalism that is found
in current-day philosophy and science. It also offers important
insights that bear on recent discussions of the nature and
characteristics of intelligence and the question of whether or not the
bodies that surround us are intelligent or have an intelligent cause.
Another reason that the work of Cavendish is important is that it
anticipates some of the central views and arguments that are more
commonly associated with figures like Thomas Hobbes and David Hume.
She also offers novel and compelling responses to questions that are
central to the discussions of the Seventeenth Century – for example,
about whether sense perception is by means of impressions; about
whether human beings are free in a libertarian or a compatibilist
sense; about whether whether there is any true disorder in the natural
world; about the limits of knowledge, and the limits of ideas and
language; and about how motion is transferred between bodies. In
addition, she takes on important debates in social and political
philosophy, with a focus on issues of agency and authority, and in
particular on the relation between an individual's desire to live a
life with which they identify and the receptivity and accommodation
that that desire encounters in the world outside the mind. Finally,
she anticipates discussions in the work of contemporary philosophers
about whether or not our ability to understand how matter thinks is
relevant to the question of whether it does think.

Cellular Automata,0.840118944644928,0.4483049511909485,"

Cellular automata (henceforth: CA) are discrete, abstract
computational systems that have proved useful both as general
models of complexity and as more specific representations of
non-linear dynamics in a variety of scientific fields. Firstly, CA are
(typically) spatially and temporally discrete: they are
composed of a finite or denumerable set of homogenous, simple units,
the atoms or cells. At each time unit, the cells
instantiate one of a finite set of states. They evolve in parallel at
discrete time steps, following state update functions or dynamical
transition rules: the update of a cell state obtains by taking into
account the states of cells in its local neighborhood (there are,
therefore, no actions at a distance). Secondly, CA are
abstract: they can be specified in purely mathematical terms
and physical structures can implement them. Thirdly, CA are
computational systems: they can compute functions and solve
algorithmic problems. Despite functioning in a different way from
traditional, Turing machine-like devices, CA with suitable rules can
emulate a universal
 Turing machine (see entry),
 and therefore compute, given Turing’s thesis (see entry on
 Church-Turing thesis),
 anything computable.

The mark of CA is in their displaying complex emergent behavior,
starting from simple atoms following simple local rules. Because of
this, CA attract a growing number of researchers from the cognitive
and natural sciences willing to study pattern formation and complexity
in a pure, abstract setting. This entry provides an introduction to CA
and focuses on some of their philosophical applications: these range
from the philosophy of computation and information processing, to
accounts of reduction and emergence in metaphysics and cognition, to
debates around the foundations of physics.

We will proceed as follows. In the introductory Section 1, CA are
first explained via an example: Section 1.1 describes a simple
one-dimensional automaton displaying an intuitively manifest behavior.
Sections 1.2–1.3 provide a short survey of the history and main
applications of CA.

In Section 2, the general theory of CA is explained, together with a
selection of computational and complexity-theoretic results in the
field. Section 2.1 provides a fourfold schematic definition of CA.
Sections 2.2–2.3 explain the classification of one-dimensional
CA proposed by Stephen Wolfram. Section 2.4 introduces the Edge of
Chaos hypothesis, a key CA-related conjecture in complexity theory.
Sections 2.5–2.7 generalize to automata occupying more than one
spatial dimension, and/or relaxing some parameters in the definition
of 2.1. We focus on the Game of Life—possibly the most popular
CA—and its computational capabilities. 

Section 3 describes four main uses of CA in philosophical
investigation. Firstly, since CA display complex behavioral patterns
emerging from simple local rules, they have been naturally linked to
emergence: this topic is dealt with in Section 3.1, where
different notions of emergence are considered. Secondly, Section 3.2
explores how CA have been put to work, both by philosophers and by
scientists, to address the traditional philosophical problems of
free will and determinism. Thirdly, Section 3.3
describes the impact of CA theories on the philosophy of computation.
Finally, Section 3.4 addresses ontological issues ranging from the
sense in which CA count as modelling portions of reality, to the bold
philosophical conjecture of some scientists, who claim that the
physical world itself may be, at its bottom, a discrete, digital
automaton.

Pornography and Censorship,0.6006101369857788,0.6376426815986633,"


Can a government legitimately prohibit citizens from publishing or
viewing pornography, or would this be an unjustified violation of basic
freedoms?


This question lies at the heart of a debate that raises fundamental
issues about just when, and on what grounds, the state is justified in
using its coercive powers to limit the freedom of individuals.


Traditionally, liberals defended the freedom of consenting adults to
publish and consume pornography in private from moral and religious
conservatives who wanted pornography banned for its obscenity, its
corrupting impact on consumers and its corrosive effect on traditional
family and religious values. But, in more recent times, the
pornography debate has taken on a somewhat new and surprising
shape. Some feminists have found themselves allied with their
traditional conservative foes in calling on the state to regulate or
prohibit pornography-although the primary focus of feminist concern is
on the harm that pornography may cause to women (and children), rather
than the obscenity of its sexually explicit content. And some liberals
have joined pro-censorship feminists in suggesting that the harms that
violent and degrading pornography causes to women's social standing
and opportunities might be sufficiently serious to justify prohibiting
such pornography on liberal grounds. Many others, both liberals and
feminists, remain unconvinced. They are doubtful that pornography is a
significant cause of the oppression of women or that the “blunt and
treacherous” instrument of the law is the best solution to such harm
as pornography may cause. As we shall see, the debate over whether
pornography should be censored remains very much alive.

Certainty,0.7268351912498474,0.7444047331809998,"


Like knowledge, certainty is an epistemic property of beliefs.
(In a derivative way, certainty is also an epistemic property of
subjects: S is certain that p just in case
S's belief that p is certain.) Although
some philosophers have thought that there is no difference between
knowledge and certainty, it has become increasingly common to
distinguish them. On this conception, then, certainty is either
the highest form of knowledge or is the only epistemic property
superior to knowledge. One of the primary motivations for
allowing kinds of knowledge less than certainty is the widespread sense
that skeptical arguments are successful in showing that we rarely or
never have beliefs that are certain (see Unger 1975 for this kind of
skeptical argument) but do not succeed in showing that our beliefs are
altogether without epistemic worth (see, for example, Lehrer 1974,
Williams 1999, and Feldman 2003; see Fumerton 1995 for an argument that
skepticism undermines every epistemic status a belief might have; and
see Klein 1981 for the argument that knowledge requires certainty,
which we are capable of having).


As with knowledge, it is difficult to provide an uncontentious
analysis of certainty. There are several reasons for this.
One is that there are different kinds of certainty, which are easy to
conflate. Another is that the full value of certainty is
surprisingly hard to capture. A third reason is that there are
two dimensions to certainty: a belief can be certain at a moment or
over some greater length of time.

Randomness, as we ordinarily think of it, exists when some outcomes occur haphazardly, unpredictably, or by chance. These latter three notions are all distinct, but all have some kind of close connection to probability. Notoriously, there are many kinds of probability: subjective probabilities (‘degrees of belief’), evidential probabilities, and objective chances, to name a few (Hájek 2012), and we might enquire into the connections between randomness and any of these species of probability.

In this entry, we focus on the potential connections between randomness and chance, or physical probability. The ordinary way that the word ‘random’ gets used is more or less interchangeable with ‘chancy’, which suggests this Commonplace Thesis—a useful claim to target in our discussion:

Something is random iff it happens by chance.



The Commonplace Thesis, and the close connection between randomness and chance it proposes, appears also to be endorsed in the scientific
literature, as in this example from a popular textbook on evolution (which also throws in the notion of unpredictability for good measure):


scientists use chance, or randomness, to mean that when physical
causes can result in any of several outcomes, we cannot predict what
the outcome will be in any particular case. (Futuyma 2005:
225)


Some philosophers are, no doubt, equally subject to this unthinking
elision, but others connect chance and randomness deliberately. Suppes
approvingly introduces


the view that the universe is essentially probabilistic in character,
or, to put it in more colloquial language, that the world is full of
random happenings. (Suppes 1984: 27)


However a number of technical and philosophical advances in our
understanding of both chance and randomness open up the possibility
that the easy slide between chance and randomness in ordinary and
scientific usage—a slide that would be vindicated by the truth of
the Commonplace Thesis—is quite misleading. This entry will
attempt to spell out these developments and clarify the differences
between chance and randomness, as well as the areas in which they
overlap in application. It will also aim to clarify the relationship of
chance and randomness to other important notions in the vicinity,
particularly determinism and predictability (themselves often subject
to confusion).


There will be philosophically significant consequences if the
Commonplace Thesis is incorrect, and if ordinary usage is misleading.
For example, it is intuitively plausible that if an event is truly
random it cannot be explained (if it happens for a reason, it isn’t truly random). It might seem then that the possibility
of probabilistic explanation is undermined when the probabilities
involved are genuine chances. Yet this pessimistic conclusion only
follows under the assumption, derived from the Commonplace Thesis, that
all chancy outcomes are random. Another interesting case is the role of
random sampling in statistical inference. If randomness requires
chance, then no statistical inferences on the basis of
‘randomly’ sampling a large population will be valid unless
the experimental design involves genuine chance in the selection of
subjects. But the rationale for random sampling may not require chance sampling—as long as our sample is representative, those
statistical inferences may be reliable. But in
that case, we’d be in a curious situation where random sampling
wouldn’t have much to do with randomness, and whatever justification
for beliefs based on random sampling that randomness is currently
thought to provide would need to be replaced by something else.
A final case of considerable philosophical interest is the frequentist approach to objective probability, which claims (roughly) that the chance of an outcome is its frequency in an appropriate series of outcomes (Hájek 2012 §3.4). To avoid classifying perfectly regular recurring outcomes as chancy, frequentists like von Mises (1957) proposed to require that the series of outcomes should be random, without pattern or order. Frequentism may fall with the Commonplace Thesis: if there can be chancy outcomes without randomness, both will fail.


The Commonplace Thesis is central to all three examples. As it is widely accepted that probabilistic explanation is legimitate, that random sampling doesn’t need genuine chance (though it can help), and that frequentism is in serious trouble (Hájek 1997), there is already some some pressure on the Commonplace
Thesis. But we must subject it to closer examination to clarify
whether these arguments do succeed, and what exactly it means to say of
some event or process that it is random or chancy. Though developing
further consequences of this kind is not the primary aim of this entry,
it is hoped that what is said here may help to untangle these and other
vexed issues surrounding chance and randomness.

Change and Inconsistency,0.7108545303344727,0.31987181305885315,"


Change is so pervasive in our lives that it almost defeats
description and analysis. One can think of it in a very general way
as alteration. But alteration in a thing raises subtle problems. One
of the most perplexing is the problem of the consistency of change:
how can one thing have incompatible properties and yet remain the
same thing? Some have held that change is a consistent process, and
rendered so by the existence of time. Others have held that the only
way to make sense of change is as an inconsistency. This entry
surveys the history of this problem and cognate issues, and concludes
that the case for change as inconsistency cannot be dismissed so
easily.

Chaos,0.9335726499557496,0.3855862617492676,"

 The big news about chaos is supposed to be that the smallest of
changes in a system can result in very large differences in that
system’s behavior. The so-called butterfly effect has become one of
the most popular images of chaos. The idea is that the flapping of a
butterfly’s wings in Argentina could cause a tornado in Texas three
weeks later. By contrast, in an identical copy of the world sans the
Argentinian butterfly, no such storm would have arisen in Texas. The
mathematical version of this property is known as sensitive
dependence. However, it turns out that sensitive dependence is
somewhat old news, so some of the implications flowing from it are
perhaps not such “big news” after all. Still, chaos
studies have highlighted these implications in fresh ways and led to
thinking about other implications as well.


 In addition to exhibiting sensitive dependence, chaotic systems
possess two other properties: they are deterministic and nonlinear
(Smith 2007). This entry discusses systems exhibiting these three
properties and what their philosophical implications might be for
theories and theoretical understanding, confirmation, explanation,
realism, determinism, free will and consciousness, and human and
divine action.

Moral Character,0.510941207408905,0.5698534846305847,"


Questions about moral character have recently come to occupy a central
place in philosophical discussion. Part of the explanation for this
development can be traced to the publication in 1958 of G. E. M.
Anscombe’s seminal article “Modern Moral Philosophy.” In
that paper Anscombe argued that Kantianism and utilitarianism, the two
major traditions in western moral philosophy, mistakenly placed the
foundation for morality in legalistic notions such as duty and
obligation. To do ethics properly, Anscombe argued, one must start
with what it is for a human being to flourish or live well. That meant
returning to some questions that mattered deeply to the ancient Greek
moralists. These questions focussed on the nature of
“virtue” (or what we might think of as admirable moral
character), of how one becomes virtuous (is it taught? does it arise
naturally? are we responsible for its development?), and of what
relationships and institutions may be necessary to make becoming
virtuous possible. Answers to these ancient questions emerge today in
various areas of philosophy, including ethics (especially virtue
ethics), feminist ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of
education, and philosophy of literature. Interest in virtue and
character was also indirectly the result of a more practical turn in
political philosophy, inspired by the publication of John
Rawls’s A Theory of Justice in 1971. Especially in Part III
of A Theory of Justice, Rawls provided a picture of how
individuals might be brought up in a just state to develop the virtues
expected of good citizens. Although his interest was not in moral
education per se, his discussion of how individuals acquire a sense of
justice and of how they develop what he called self-respect stimulated
other philosophers to explore the psychological foundations of virtue
and the contributions made by friendship, family, community, and
meaningful work to good moral character.


This entry provides a brief historical account of some important
developments in philosophical approaches to good moral character.
Approximately half the entry is on the Greek moralists Socrates, Plato,
Aristotle, and the Stoics. Of these, most attention is given to
Aristotle’s views, since most other philosophical discussions of
character are indebted to his analysis. The latter half of the entry
explores how other philosophers have responded to the concerns first
raised by the Greeks. Some philosophers, such as Hugo Grotius and
Immanuel Kant, represent a “modern” approach to character that
subordinates it to other moral notions such as duty and obedience to
law. Other philosophers, such as David Hume, Karl Marx, and John Stuart
Mill, take an interest in the psychology of moral character that is
more reminiscent of the Greeks. Finally, this entry indicates the
directions taken by some contemporary philosophers in recent work on or
related to moral character.

Empirical Approaches to Moral Character,0.5073122382164001,0.5792064666748047,"

The turn of the century saw a significant increase in the amount of
attention being paid by philosophers to empirical issues about moral
character. Dating back at least to Plato and Aristotle in the West,
and Confucius in the East, philosophers have traditionally drawn on
empirical data to some extent in their theorizing about character. One
of the main differences in recent years has been the source of this
empirical data, namely the work of social and personality
psychologists on morally relevant thought and action.

This entry briefly examines four recent empirical approaches to moral
character. It will draw on the psychology literature where
appropriate, but the main focus will be on the significance of that
work for philosophers interested in better understanding moral
character. The four areas are situationism, the CAPS model, the Big
Five model, and the VIA. The remainder of this entry devotes a section
to each of them.

Émilie du Châtelet,0.6599315404891968,0.3763668835163117,"


Émilie le Tonnelier de Breteuil, marquise Du
Châtelet-Lomont—or simply Émilie Du 
Châtelet—was born in Paris on 17 December 1706 to baron Louis Nicholas
le Tonnelier de Breteuil and Gabrielle Anne de Froullay, Baronne de
Breteuil. She married Marquis Florent-Claude de Châtelet-Lomont
in 1725. Together they had three children, a daughter and two sons
(the second died the year after his birth). In 1733, she met Voltaire
who became her lover and life-long intellectual companion. They
retired to Du Châtelet's husband's
estate—Cirey—which was remodeled to include a laboratory
with several instruments for their on-going scientific experiments. In
1748, she became pregnant at the age of 42 with the child of her then
lover, Jean-François de Saint-Lambert. She bore her fourth
child, a daughter, on 4 September 1749 and died on 10 September
1749.


In her intellectual work, Du Châtelet focused on natural
philosophy, particularly that of Newton, Leibniz and Christian Wolff.
She knew, corresponded with, or was tutored by Pierre Louis de
Maupertuis, Alexis-Claude Clairaut, Samuel Koenig, and several members
of the Bernoulli family, and her advanced abilities in physics and
mathematics made her especially able to write capably about
Newton's physics. She thus contributed to the shift in France
away from an acceptance of Cartesian physics and toward the embrace of
Newtonian physics. Nonetheless, she was more than just an expositor of
others' works, and she was not interested in physics alone.
Indeed, still squarely in the tradition of natural philosophy, Du
Châtelet sought a metaphysical basis for the Newtonian physics
she embraced upon rejecting Cartesianism.


Voltaire implicitly acknowledged her significant
contribution—especially on more technical material—to his
1738 Eléments de la philosophie de Newton. For many
years, it was believed that there was one surviving chapter from an
otherwise lost work written by Du Châtelet—her
“Essai sur l'optique” (ca. 1736). This chapter is housed
among Voltaire's papers in Russia's National Library in
St. Petersberg. Judging from that chapter on color formation this
earlier essay seems to have been a more developed version of the
chapter on optics in Voltaire's book, thus indicating her significant
contribution to Voltaire's work. As a fascinating side note on how
dynamic Du Châtelet studies are, in recent years fully three
complete copies of her Essai have been found, one in
Bernoulli's papers in Basel (Nagel 2012) and two that have been
acquired recently by the Musée des lettres et manuscrits in
Paris. In 1737 Du Châtelet entered a competition to explain the
nature of fire, conducting her experiments in secret while Voltaire
also conducted experiments for his entry to the competition. Both Du
Châtelet's and Voltaire's entries aimed to disprove the theory
that fire is a material substance, and both were published along with
the three winners (including the essay essay by Leonhard Euler, which
took the top prize). Du Châtelet returned to this project a
number of times thereafter, making significant revisions to the
original text as her ideas on the nature of fire matured and
changed.


In 1738, she published “Lettre sur les
‘Eléments de la philosophie de
Newton’” in the Journal des savants in which
she argued against those who accepted a Cartesian account of
attraction. In 1740 she published her Institutions de
physique (The Foundations of Physics) ostensibly a
textbook in physics for her son, but in reality a highly original work
in natural philosophy (a second edition was published in 1742 under
the slightly altered title Institutions physique). It was in
this text—her magnum opus—that she supplied the
metaphysical basis for the Newtonian physics she had long
accepted. This metaphysics was Leibnizian and Wolffian in flavor. Her
inclusion of a defense of force vive (she thus sided with
Leibniz on this question) led to her subsequent dispute on the issue
with Jean-Jacques Dortous de Mairan. Sometime in the early 1740s she
began work on her two-volume translation of and commentary on Newton's
Principia. She died shortly after she completed this work,
which remained unpublished until 1759. It is still the leading French
translation of Newton's book.


While Du Châtelet's primary interest was in natural
philosophy, she also had interests in ethics (translating of portions
of Mandeville's Fable of the Bees), theology and the
Bible (writing a book titled Examens de la
Bible), and the source of human happiness
(writing a semi-autobiographical book, Discours sur le
bonheur). Her non-scientific work occasionally touched on the
subject of women's social roles and their education.


This entry focuses on Du Châtelet's natural philosophy,
which occupied the bulk of her intellectual efforts. More specifically,
it focuses on that aspect of her thought as found in her own clearly
articulated version of natural philosophy—her masterwork of
1740, The Foundations of Physics.

Walter Chatton,0.7332086563110352,0.12494740635156633,"
 
Walter Chatton or more rarely “Catton”
(c. 1290–1343) was an English theologian and philosopher who
trained at Oxford around the same time as his famous colleague and
frequent philosophical target, William of Ockham. More inclined to
speculative metaphysics and less skeptical of reason than Ockham,
Chatton was one of the most energetic and gifted critics of the
influential brand of nominalism which arose in early
fourteenth-century England around Ockham. As a constructive
philosopher, Chatton was not a system-builder, but a defender of
certain parts of the more systematic philosophy of John Duns Scotus,
and an advocate of perspectivist accounts of cognition. Historically
he is an interesting figure because he combined the realist tendencies
of Scotism with the appreciation of logic and language we see in
Ockham; thus it is common to find Chatton defending Scotistic
theses and criticizing Ockham using the same sorts of semantic ideas
that Ockham himself popularized. His unyielding attacks on Ockham bore
him fruit intellectually and otherwise: we have evidence of
Ockham changing his mind on several seminal issues as a direct result
of Chatton’s critiques. Moreover, he seems to have built a very
successful ecclesiastical career, no doubt based in part on his
cleverness; he served as an advisor to two popes, and earned for
himself, but did not live long enough to enjoy, a bishopric in Wales.
His stature as a theologian rose high enough in his lifetime that his
opinions on sacramental efficacy were remembered and cited at the
Council of Trent, two hundred years after his death.


Although his importance has long been known to Ockham specialists,
complete critical editions of his work have only recently become
available, and detailed scholarly analysis of his views, influence,
and intellectual life are in a nascent stage. Consequently, this
article will not summarize his positions under broad, modern headings
such as ‘metaphysics’, ‘epistemology’, etc.,
but will rather present exposition and analysis of his contributions
to several narrower problems which remain philosophically viable
today.

Philosophy of Chemistry,0.8828406929969788,0.2982395589351654,"


Chemistry is the study of the structure and transformation of
matter. When Aristotle wrote the first systematic treatises on
chemistry in the 4th century BCE, his conceptual grasp of
the nature of matter was tailored to accommodate a relatively simple
range of observable phenomena. In the 21st century,
chemistry has become the largest scientific discipline, producing over
half a million publications a year ranging from direct empirical
investigations to substantial theoretical work.  However, the
specialized interest in the conceptual issues arising in chemistry,
hereafter Philosophy of Chemistry, is a relatively recent
addition to philosophy of science.


Philosophy of chemistry has two major parts. In the first,
conceptual issues arising within chemistry are carefully articulated
and analyzed. Such questions which are internal to chemistry include
the nature of substance, atomism, the chemical bond, and synthesis. In
the second, traditional topics in philosophy of science such as
realism, reduction, explanation, confirmation, and modeling are taken
up within the context of chemistry.

The philosophy of childhood has recently come to be recognized as
an area of inquiry analogous to the philosophy of science, the
philosophy of history, the philosophy of religion, and the many other
“philosophy of” subjects that are already considered
legitimate areas of philosophical study. In addition, philosophical
study of related topics (such as parental rights, duties and
responsibilities) has flourished in recent years. The philosophy of
childhood takes up philosophically interesting questions about
childhood, changing conceptions over time about childhood and
attitudes toward children; theories of cognitive and moral
development; children's interests and children's rights, the goods of
childhood; children and autonomy; the moral status of children and the
place of children in society. As an academic subject, the philosophy
of childhood has sometimes been included within the philosophy of
education (e.g., Siegel, 2009). Recently, however, philosophers have
begun to offer college and university courses specifically in the
philosophy of childhood. And philosophical literature on childhood,
parenting and families is increasing in both quantity and quality.

In the United States, philosophy typically makes its formal entry into
the curriculum at the college level. A growing number of high schools
offer some introduction to philosophy, often in special literature
courses for college bound students. In Europe and many other
countries, it is much more common to find philosophy in the high
school curriculum.  However, philosophy prior to high school seems
relatively uncommon around the world. This may suggest that serious
philosophical thinking is not for pre-adolescents. Two reasons might
be offered for accepting this view. First, philosophical thinking
requires a level of cognitive development that, one may believe, is
beyond the reach of pre-adolescents. Second, the school curriculum is
already crowded; and introducing a subject like philosophy will not
only distract students from what they need to learn, it may encourage
them to become skeptics rather than learners. However, both of these
reasons can be challenged. They will be addressed in turn.

Philosophy in Chile,0.6012231111526489,0.5781093239784241,"
Philosophy in Chile, as in the rest of Latin America, has been an
academic pursuit ever since the conquest and settlement of the New
World by Spain and Portugal in the early sixteenth century. Very few
philosophers ventured beyond the walls of academic or religious
institutions (usually one and the same) during the entire colonial
period, which ended in most Spanish American countries (the exceptions
being Cuba and Puerto Rico) in the early nineteenth century. Even
after Independence, philosophy remained a fundamentally academic
endeavor.  Chile, in contrast to other nations in the region, has
shown remarkable institutional continuity, with the exception of the
years of military rule in the last quarter of the twentieth
century.
The academic context in which the discipline developed, however,
has not prevented philosophers from engaging in social and political
activities, and, especially, in debates concerning the history,
culture and direction of the emerging nations. Philosophers have been
important political figures since the early republic as well as
leaders in the university reform processes that have taken place
during the country’s modern history. During the period of
military rule (1973–1990) several became important opponents of
the regime. A concern for politics, in fact, has dominated the agenda
of philosophers, including those who have denounced the encroachment
of politics in the discipline.
The centrality of politics, even in cases of direct involvement in
it, has not distracted philosophers from their essential commitment to
exploring different philosophical (predominantly European) schools,
some specific fields within the discipline, such as logic and
metaphysics, and some thematic concerns like the role of religion in a
secular state, the impact of modernity on self and society, and the
role of universities in the development of nationhood. Chilean
philosophy is characterized by a constant tension between academic
pursuits solely informed by developments within the discipline, and
critical outlooks that demand a closer philosophical engagement with
politics and society.

Human/Non-Human Chimeras,0.5303588509559631,0.7173202037811279,"


A chimera is an individual composed of cells with different embryonic
origins. The successful isolation of five human embryonic stem cell
(hESC) lines in 1998 increased scientists' ability to create
human/non-human chimeras and prompted extensive bioethics discussion,
resulting in what has been dubbed “the other stem cell
debate” (Shreeve 2005). The debate about chimeras has focused on
five main arguments. The Unnaturalness Argument explores the ethics of
violating natural species boundaries. The Moral Confusion Argument
alleges that the existence of entities that cannot be definitively
classified as either human or non-human will cause moral confusion
that will undermine valuable social and cultural practices. The
Borderline-Personhood Argument focuses on great apes and concludes
that their borderline-personhood confers a high enough degree of moral
status to make most, if not all, chimeric research on them
impermissible. The Human Dignity Argument claims that it is an affront
to human dignity to give an individual “trapped” in the
body of a non-human animal the capacities associated with human
dignity. Finally, the Moral Status Framework maintains that research
in which a non-human animal's moral status is enhanced to that of a
normal adult human is impermissible unless reasonable assurances are
in place that its new moral status will be respected, which is
unlikely given the motivations for chimeric research and the oversight
likely to be provided. These arguments provide different rationales
for evaluating chimeric research and consequently differ in their
implications both for the range of chimeric research that is unethical
as well as the way chimeric research should be addressed in public
policy.

Chinese Ethics,0.4538394808769226,0.4753003120422363,"


The tradition of Chinese ethical thought is centrally concerned with 
questions about how one ought to live: what goes into a worthwhile 
life, how to weigh duties toward family versus duties toward 
strangers, whether human nature is predisposed to be morally good or 
bad, how one ought to relate to the non-human world, the extent to 
which one ought to become involved in reforming the larger social and
political structures of one's society, and how one ought to conduct 
oneself when in a position of influence or power. The personal, 
social, and political are often intertwined in Chinese approaches to 
the subject. Anyone who wants to draw from the range of important 
traditions of thought on this subject needs to look seriously at the 
Chinese tradition. The canonical texts of that tradition have been 
memorized by schoolchildren in Asian societies for hundreds of years,
and at the same time have served as objects of sophisticated and 
rigorous analysis by scholars and theoreticians rooted in widely

Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, Legalism, and Chinese Buddhism.

Chinese Philosophy and Chinese Medicine,0.4569385051727295,0.4170292317867279,"


According to Zhang Xichun 張錫純 (1860–1933), one
of the leading reformers of Chinese medicine in the early twentieth
century:

Many recent medical journal reports take the view that [traditional
Chinese] philosophy holds back the progress of medicine, but their
authors do not understand the use of philosophy, nor do they understand
that philosophy is actually the basis of medicine. (Zhang Xichun
1918–1934, 296).


At first glance, this assertion seems improbable to say the
least. This essay addresses some of the connections between
Chinese philosophy and Chinese medicine in both intellectual and social
aspects.


The first section locates medicine among the Chinese sciences and
introduces the intellectual shared common ground of Chinese philosophy
and Chinese medicine, including shared theories of qi,
yin-yang and “Five Agents” (wuxing) and
their use in analogies between the human body and the state and cosmos,
including the development of a systematic medical theory of the
body. Section Two introduces the important medical contributions
of “nurturing life” (yang sheng) traditions. 
Section Three takes up what has been represented as a long shared
history of Daoism and medicine in the works of three great Daoist
physicians. Section Four returns to the views of Zhang Xichun and his
claims for an explicit link between Chinese Medicine and Chinese
Philosophy.

thinker, political figure, educator, and founder of

of much of subsequent Chinese speculation on the education and
comportment of the ideal man, how such an individual should live his
life and interact with others, and the forms of society and government

Daoism,0.4720427691936493,0.4286651611328125,"


 Daoism[1]
 stands alongside Confucianism as one of the two great
religious/philosophical systems of China. Traditionally traced to the
mythical Laozi “Old Philosopher,” Philosophical Daoism owes more to
“philosopher Zhuang” (Zhuangzi) (4th Century BCE). Daoism is
an umbrella that covers a range of similarly motivated doctrines. The
term “Daoism” is also associated with assorted naturalistic or
mystical religions. Sometimes the term “Lao-Zhuang Philosophy” is used
to distinguish the philosophical from the more religious “Huang-Lao”
(Yellow Emperor-Laozi) strain of Daoist thought.

Both the Daode Jing and the Zhuangzi are composite
texts written and rewritten over centuries with varied input from
multiple anonymous writers. Each has a distinctive rhetorical style,
the Daode Jing terse and poetic, the Zhuangzi
prolix, funny, elusive and filled with fantasy dialogues. Both texts
flow from reflections on the nature of dao
(way) and related concepts that were central
to the ethical disputes of Ancient China. The concept of “Daoism” as a
theme or group did not exist at the time of the Classical Daoists, but
we have some reasons to suspect the communities focusing on
the Zhuangzi and Laozi texts were in contact with
each other.  The texts share some figurative expressions and themes,
an ironic detachment from the first order moral issues so hotly
debated by the Mohists and Confucians preferring a reflective,
metaethical focus on the nature and development
of ways. Their metaethics vaguely favored different
first-order normative theories (anarchism, pluralism, laissez faire
government. The meta-ethical focus and the related less demanding
first order ethics mostly distinguishes “Daoists” from other thinkers
of the period.

The meta-ethical reflections were by turns skeptical then relativist,
here naturalist and there mystical. Daoism per se has no “constant
dao.” However, it does have a common spirit.
Dao-centered
philosophical reflection engendered a distinctive ambivalence in
advocacy—manifested in their indirect, non-argumentative
style, their use of poetry and parable. In ancient China, the
political implication of this Dao-ism was mainly an opposition to
authority, government, coercion, and even to normal socialization in
values. Daoist “spontaneity” was contrasted with subtle or overt
indoctrination in any specific or social dao.

Western theoretical discourses.  The concepts and categories used in
Chinese philosophy cannot be easily transferred from one
socio-cultural context into another, and it is often difficult to
understand this philosophy through the lens of traditional Western
thought.  The exclusive application of Western methods can thus lead
to severe misunderstandings and false interpretations of Chinese
discourses.  It is therefore important to use caution so as not to
diminish the richness and depth of Chinese thought or turn it into
a weak version of Western philosophical thought.

The epistemological dimensions of Chinese texts and their role in the
context of Chinese thought has been developed increasingly
successfully under the aegis of rediscovering and applying specific
traditional Chinese methodological approaches and categories (Lenk and
Paul 1993). The present entry similarly explores Chinese epistemology
through the lens of conceptual and ideational assets created and
developed in the Chinese tradition (Creller 2014: 196).
According to the prevailing traditional European epistemologies,
knowledge has mainly been gained through observation and reasoning.
However, in traditional Chinese thought, knowledge has been understood
in a much broader sense, namely as something which also (or primarily)
stems from moral contents and which cannot be separated from (social)
practice. The method which determined most of the epistemological
teachings found in the Chinese classics was based on a holistic world
view, and was directed towards a comprehension which could be achieved
through education and learning. The basic contents of these teachings
were rooted in the premises of pragmatic and utilitarian ethics.
Chinese epistemology was relational (Rošker 2012), meaning that it
understood the external world to be ordered structurally, while the
human mind was also structured in accordance with its all-embracing
but open, organic system (li 理). The relational
correspondence between the cosmic and mental structures thus
represents the basic precondition of human perception and
comprehension.
This entry will provide a systematic overview of the special
features, the central methods and the main developmental streams of
classical Chinese epistemological discourses that were based on a
structurally ordered holistic worldview and rooted in axiological
premises.

Laozi,0.4721636474132538,0.4401275217533112,"


Confucianism, Daoism (Taoism), and Buddhism generally name the three
main pillars of Chinese thought, although it should be obvious that
like any “ism,” they are abstractions—what they name
are not monolithic but multifaceted traditions with fuzzy
boundaries. In the case of “Daoism,” it designates both a
philosophical tradition and an organized religion, which in modern
Chinese are identified separately as daojia
and daojiao, respectively. With their own complex histories
and rich internal differences, the two are deeply intertwined. Laozi
(or Lao-tzu, in the “Wade-Giles” system of transliteration
favored by earlier generations of Western scholars) figures centrally
in both.


Philosophical Daoism traces its origins to Laozi, an extraordinary
thinker who flourished during the sixth century B.C.E., according to
Chinese tradition. According to some modern scholars, however, Laozi
is entirely legendary; there was never a historical Laozi. In
religious Daoism, Laozi is revered as a supreme deity.


The name “Laozi” is best taken to mean “Old
(lao) Master (zi),” and Laozi the ancient
philosopher is said to have written a short book, which has come to be
called simply the Laozi, after its putative author, a common
practice in early China. When the Laozi was recognized as a
“classic” (jing)—that is, accorded
canonical status in the classification of Chinese literature, on
account of its profound insight and significance—it acquired a
more exalted and hermeneutically instructive title, Daodejing
(Tao-te ching), commonly translated as the “Classic of
the Way and Virtue.” Its influence on Chinese culture is
pervasive, and it reaches beyond China. Next to the Bible,
the Daodejing is the most translated work in world
literature. It is concerned with the Dao or “Way” and how
it finds expression in “virtue” (de), especially
through what the text calls “naturalness” (ziran)
and “nonaction” (wuwei). These concepts, however,
are open to interpretation. While some interpreters see them as
evidence that the Laozi is a “mystical” work,
others emphasize their contribution to ethics and/or political
philosophy. Interpreting the Laozi demands careful
hermeneutic reconstruction, which requires both analytic rigor and an
informed historical imagination.

Legalism in Chinese Philosophy,0.44646862149238586,0.4951541125774384,"


Legalism is a popular—albeit quite
inaccurate—designation of an intellectual current that gained
considerable popularity in the latter half of the Warring States period
(Zhanguo, 453–221 BCE). Legalists were political realists who sought to
attain a “rich state with powerful army” and to ensure
domestic stability in an age marked by intense inter- and intra-state
competition. They believed that human beings—commoners and elites
alike—will forever remain selfish and covetous of riches and
fame, and one should not expect them to behave morally. Rather, a
viable sociopolitical system should allow individuals to pursue their
selfish interests exclusively in ways that benefit the state, viz.
agriculture and warfare; while a proper administrative system should
allow officials to benefit from ranks and emoluments, but also prevent
them from subverting the ruler’s power. Both systems are
unconcerned with individual morality of the rulers and the ruled;
rather they should be based on impersonal norms and standards: laws,
administrative regulations, clearly defined rules of promotion and
demotion, and the like.


Legalist thinkers contributed greatly to the formation of
China’s empire both on the theoretical level and as political
practitioners; and many of their ideas continued to be employed
throughout China’s history. Yet their derisive views of
moralizing discourse of their rivals, their haughty stance toward
fellow intellectuals, and their pronouncedly anti-ministerial rhetoric
all gained them immense dislike among the imperial literati. From
China’s second imperial dynasty, the Han (206 BCE–220 CE)
on, the prestige of Legalism declined; only a few texts associated
with this current survived intact; and even in the modern period,
notwithstanding sporadic outbursts of interest in Legalism, this
current has not received adequate scholarly attention.

Logic and Language in Early Chinese Philosophy,0.6228837370872498,0.920878529548645,"

Scholarship on early Chinese views on logic and language tends to
concentrate on the contributions of the school of Mohism, which played
a central role in the debates of philosophers of all major schools
during China’s Warring States period (479–221 BCE). The
Mohists helped to critically refine early Chinese conceptions of the
content and function of logic and language in relation to their
aspirations for developing a comprehensive ethical theory about the
proper governance of the state and the individual’s role within
it. It is somewhat difficult to distinguish the Mohists’ logical
insights from their views on language in part because they made no
attempt at investigating formal logic independently of their interests
in analyzing the semantics of the terms of language (ming, or
“names”). They developed a clear theory of inference, and
supported this theory with versions of basic principles we would
recognize today as central to the study of logic, but argued that the
rules governing inference are partly determined by the semantics of
individual terms and terms in combination, as opposed to rules merely
operating on an argument’s logical form.

It is also difficult to distinguish early Chinese philosophers’
attempts at offering a descriptive account of the content and function
of language from their normative views about the roles names should be
expected to play if they are to contribute to the elevation of human
character and proper conduct in society. These normative views are
especially clear in the writings of Xunzi, a Confucian scholar of the
late Warring States period who attempted to assimilate the key
insights of the Mohists on language and logic into a general Confucian
theory of ethics (Lin 2011). In Book 22 of the Xunzi
(“Correct Naming”), he explains:


When with differences in expression and divergence in thought we
communicate with each other, and different things are obscurely
confounded in name or as objects, the noble and the base will not be
clarified, the same and different will not be distinguished; in such
cases intent will inevitably suffer from frustration and obstruction.
Therefore the wise made for them apportionments and distinctions and
instituted names to point out objects, in the first place in order to
clarify noble and base, secondly to distinguish same and different.
When noble and base are clarified, and same and different
distinguished, intent is not hampered by failure to communicate and
action does not suffer from frustration and obstruction. This is the
purpose of having names. (tr. Graham 1989)


That is, the central purpose of the analysis of language is to serve
the normative function of providing standards for clarifying
communicative intentions and guiding behavior. More generally, it is
intended to provide a justificatory framework for resolving ethical
disputes. This general view is also evident in the writings of the
Mohists themselves, who hoped that the analysis of language would help
to reveal semantic distinctions relevant to proper ethical conduct.
This obscures the distinction between stipulation and disinterested
analysis, for it is held that language as a medium for human discourse
should not be neutral with respect to ethical aims and the methods one
should undertake to achieve them.

Given the great abundance of literature explicitly devoted to
interpreting and reconstructing early Chinese views on language, it is
impractical to attempt any exhaustive treatment here. To maintain
common points of focus, attention will be restricted to those issues
that appear to have obvious bearing on early Chinese
philosophers’ interest in logic, specifically as it pertains to
theories of reason and inference, generally construed. Our main
questions are: How did early Chinese philosophers’ views about
the content and function of language contribute to their understanding
of logic as the study of valid or correct inference? Secondly, in what
way did their logical investigations influence their views about
language? Arguably, from the logician’s point of view, the
greatest insights of early Chinese philosophers’ studies of
logic and language are to be found in the later Mohists’ studies
of intensionality, which appear to have influenced not only their
specific theories on the efficacy of argumentation but also their core
ideas about the nature and purpose of language. Further remarks
address central points of disagreement the Mohists had with their
Daoist critics, particularly as evident in the writings of Zhuangzi,
and Xunzi’s reinterpretation of Mohist logic from the vantage
point of his Confucian theory of ethics.

importance only to Confucius himself), Mencius is best known for his

Metaphysics in Chinese Philosophy,0.4575859606266022,0.43911758065223694,"
While there was no word corresponding precisely to the term
“metaphysics”, China has a long tradition of philosophical
inquiry concerned with the ultimate nature of reality—its being,
origins, components, ways of changing, and so on. In this sense, we
can speak of “metaphysics” in Chinese Philosophy, even if
the particular questions and positions that arose differed from those
dominant in Europe. Explicit metaphysical discussions appeared in
China with a turn toward questions of cosmogony in the mid-fourth
century BCE. These cosmogonies express a number of views that became
fundamental for almost all later metaphysics in China. In these texts,
all things are interconnected and constantly changing. They arise
spontaneously from an ultimate source (most often called dao
道, the way) that resists objectification but is immanent in the
world and accessible to cultivated people. Vitality and growth is the
very nature of existence, and nature exhibits consistent patterns that
can be observed and followed, in particular patterns of cycles and
interaction between polar forces (such as yin 陰
and yang 陽).
This basic outlook differs fundamentally from the assumptions that
dominated metaphysical thinking in Europe after the introduction of
Christianity: the belief that the ultimate principle of the world is
transcendent but anthropomorphic (as human beings are made in its
image), that the things of the world arise through design, and that
the world is composed of ontologically distinct substances. These
assumptions have been widely rejected by philosophers over the course
of the 20th century, which is partly what makes metaphysics in
Chinese Philosophy interesting. In the Chinese tradition we see one
possibility for what metaphysics might look like if we were neither
apologizing for nor reacting against such views (in Nietszche’s
terms, a metaphysics based neither on God nor the Death of God). This
is not to say that Chinese metaphysics is homogenous or without its
own problems. Rather, we can say that while European metaphysics has
tended to center on problems of reconciliation (how
ontologically distinct things can interact), Chinese metaphysics has
been more concerned with problems of distinction. The most
central problems are around the status of individualized things, the
relationship between the patterns of nature and specifically human
values, and how to understand the ultimate ground of the world in a
way that avoids either reification or nihilism. These become problems
precisely because of the underlying assumptions of holism and
change.
Readers should keep in mind that a survey of metaphysics in Chinese
Philosophy is no more adequate than such a survey would be regarding
Europe. I have necessarily left out more than I have included. Aside
from introducing the most influential positions and philosophers, my
primary goal is to illuminate recurring patterns and concerns that can
serve as orientation for further reading.

Mohism,0.6199166774749756,0.9183671474456788,"


Mohism was an influential philosophical, social, and religious
movement that flourished during the Warring States era (479–221
BCE) in ancient China. Mohism originates in the teachings of Mo Di, or
“Mozi” (“Master Mo,” fl. ca. 430 BCE), from
whom it takes its name.  Mozi and his followers initiated
philosophical argumentation and debate in China. They were the first
in the tradition to engage, like Socrates in ancient Greece, in an
explicit, reflective search for objective moral standards and to give
step-by-step, tightly reasoned arguments for their views, though their
reasoning is sometimes simplistic or rests on doubtful
assumptions. They formulated China’s first explicit ethical and
political theories and advanced the world’s earliest form of
consequentialism, a remarkably sophisticated version based on a
plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare.
The Mohists applied a pragmatic, non-representational theory of
language and knowledge and developed a rudimentary theory of
analogical argumentation. They played a key role in articulating and
shaping many of the central concepts, assumptions, and issues of
classical Chinese philosophical discourse.


A later branch of the school (see the entry on
 Mohist Canons)
 formulated a sophisticated semantic theory, epistemology,
utilitarian ethics, theory of analogical reasoning, and mereological
ontology and undertook inquiries in such diverse fields as geometry,
mechanics, optics, and economics. They addressed technical problems
raised by their semantics and utilitarian ethics and produced a
collection of terse, rigorous arguments that develop Mohist doctrines,
defend them against criticisms, and rebut opponents’ views.


Central elements of Mohist thought include advocacy of a unified
ethical and political order grounded in a utilitarian ethic emphasizing
impartial concern for all; active opposition to military aggression and
injury to others; devotion to utility and frugality and condemnation of
waste and luxury; support for a centralized, authoritarian state led by
a virtuous, benevolent sovereign and managed by a hierarchical,
merit-based bureaucracy; and reverence for and obedience to Heaven
(Tian, literally the sky) and the ghosts worshiped in
traditional folk religion. Mohist ethics and epistemology are
characterized by a concern with finding objective standards that will
guide judgment and action reliably and impartially so as to produce
beneficial, morally right consequences. The Mohists assume that people
are naturally motivated to do what they believe is right, and thus with
proper moral education will generally tend to conform to the correct
ethical norms. They believe strongly in the power of discussion and
persuasion to solve ethical problems and motivate action, and they are
confident that moral and political questions have objective answers
that can be discovered and defended by inquiry.

Mohist Canons,0.6226376295089722,0.920648455619812,"


The Mohist Canons are a set of brief statements on a
variety of philosophical and other topics by anonymous members of 
 the Mohist school,
an influential philosophical, social, and religious movement of
China’s Warring States period (479–221 
 B.C.).[1] 
 Written and compiled most likely between the late 4th and mid 3rd
century B.C., the Canons are often referred to as the
“later Mohist” or “Neo-Mohist” canons, since
they seem chronologically later than the Mohist
 “triads,”
 the two dozen essays that constitute the bulk of the Mohist
 writings, which probably date from the mid-5th to the late 4th
century. The Canons present philosophical ideas distinct from
the older texts, though clearly closely related to or evolved from
them. The later Mohists are also associated with the
 “School of Names,” 
 a general label for ancient Chinese thinkers who were interested in
language and argumentation. Early sources link the Mohists with the
School of Names through a shared interest in disputation over the
“hard and white” and the “same and different”
(Zhuangzi, Book 33).


The Canons, their accompanying Explanations, and
other later Mohist writings are among the most important texts in the
history of Chinese ethics, philosophy of language, epistemology, logic, and
science. They present elements of a sophisticated semantic theory,
epistemology, consequentialist ethics, and theory of analogical
argumentation, along with intriguing discussions of causality, space
and time, and mereological ontology. Also recorded are inquiries in
such diverse fields as geometry, mechanics, optics, and economics. The
writers put forward terse, rigorous arguments that develop and defend
Mohist ideas and rebut opponents’ views. The texts yield a rich taste
of an approach to language, mind, and knowledge distinct from those
dominant in the Western philosophical tradition. At the same time, by
shedding light on technical notions employed in other ancient
writings, they confirm that a grasp of early theories of language,
knowledge, and argumentation is essential to a full understanding of
classical Chinese thought. Indeed, the later Mohists decisively refute
the once widespread view that ancient Chinese thinkers were concerned
exclusively with ethics, moral psychology, and nature mysticism and
uninterested in language, epistemology, and logic. 


Given the breadth and richness of later Mohist thought, this article
can present only a narrow sample. We will focus on a handful of core
ideas and issues in ethics, philosophy of language, epistemology,
ontology, and disputation. (For a rough guide to the pronunciation of

Neo-Daoism,0.4699945747852325,0.4486744403839111,"


The term “Neo-Daoism” seeks to capture the dominant
intellectual current or focal development in “early
medieval” Chinese philosophy, from the third to the sixth
century C.E. As a label, “Neo-Daoism” (or
“Neo-Taoism,” as “Dao” appears as
“Tao” under the “Wade-Giles” system of
romanization favored by earlier generations of sinologists, before
the Hanyu pinyin system, adopted here, became standard) can
be misleading and will be explained in what follows. In Chinese
sources, this development is called
Xuanxue (Hsüan-hsüeh, in Wade-Giles),
literally the “learning” or study (xue) of the
“dark” or mysterious and profound (xuan).


In the Han dynasty lexicon, the Shuowen jiezi by Xu Shen
(fl. 100 C.E.), an important reference for the study of early Chinese
texts, the word xuan is defined in two ways. First,
xuan is defined as what is “hidden and far”
(youyuan). Second, xuan denotes a shade of
“black with dark red.” This latter appears to be the root
meaning of the term. In the Shijing (Classic of Poetry), for
example, xuan is sometimes used to depict the color of fabrics
or robes (e.g., see the poems “Qiyue” [Mao no. 154] and
“Hanyi” [Mao no. 261]). It is also used, notably in the
Yijing (Classic of Changes), to describe the color of
“heaven” (tian) (see, e.g., the
“Wenyan” commentary to Hexagram 2). Stripped of all
cosmological references, this may evoke simply an image of the approach
of dawn. In any event, by extension, xuan gains a richer
meaning connoting what is “hidden and far,” i.e., that
which cannot be perceived clearly and thus escapes understanding.


In the Laozi (also known as Daodejing), the
foundational classic of Daoist philosophy and religion, the term
xuan figures prominently and serves to bring out one of its
central tenets—namely, the profound depth and unfathomability of
the Dao or “Way.” The Dao is “formless” and
“nameless,” transcending language and sensory perception,
as the Laozi asserts, and yet it is the
“beginning” and “mother” of “heaven and
earth” and all beings. Thus, the Dao can only be described as
mysteriously profound and in this sense, “dark”
(xuan) (see especially Laozi, Chapter 1).

Xuanxue aims at unlocking the mystery of Dao, but it is not
a partisan “Daoist” school. As such, the term
“Neo-Daoism,” though convenient and widely used, is
ambiguous and must be treated with care. This will be explained more
fully in the next section.

Xuanxue is also not monolithic. The concept of Dao
provides a focus, but it invites diverse interpretation.
Xuanxue arose during a time of turmoil and uncertainty after
the fall of the Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.–220 C.E.), when leading
intellectuals of the succeeding Wei (220–265) and Jin
(265–420) dynasties sought to interrogate tradition afresh so as
to arrive at a new blueprint for order, which occasioned intense
debates and set new directions for the development of Chinese
philosophy. In what follows, I will focus on some of its major figures
and debates; but first, the meaning of Xuanxue and the context
in which it came into prominence in early medieval China require
further attention.

Science and Chinese Philosophy,0.456732302904129,0.4171512722969055,"


At first glance, there may appear to be little connection between
Chinese philosophy and science. Stereotypes of Chinese philosophy as
consisting almost entirely of Confucianism and claims that Confucians
were not interested in science add to this perception.

For example, in a recent correspondence in the journal
Nature, Peng Gong, a research scientist at Tsinghua University
and the University of California, Berkeley gives the following harsh
assessment of the effect of Chinese philosophy on the development of
science in China:

Two cultural genes have passed through generations of Chinese
intellectuals for more than 2,000 years. The first is the thoughts of
Confucius, who proposed that intellectuals should become loyal
administrators. The second is the writings of Zhuang Zhou, who said
that a harmonious society would come from isolating families so as to
avoid exchange and conflict, and by shunning technology to avoid greed.
Together, these cultures have encouraged small-scale and
self-sufficient practices in Chinese society, but discouraged
curiosity, commercialization and technology. They helped to produce a
scientific void in Chinese society that persisted for millennia. And
they continue to be relevant today (Gong 2012).

Is this a fair account? Is Chinese philosophy in some sense
anti-science? Does it contribute to science in ways that constitute a
“Chinese science” that is different from modern
science. Or is the history of science in China part of a
universal science?

This essay addresses relations between science and Chinese
philosophy in several ways. It begins with a detailed argument by the
influential historian of Chinese philosophy Fung Yu-lan almost one
hundred years ago, claiming that there is no science in China because
there is no need for any. The second section presents an opposing
view from the history of science as presented by Joseph Needham and
others, introducing a range of sciences that developed in China, with
what might be called distinctive Chinese characteristics. The
third section addresses the particular problem of Needham's
representation of Chinese science as significantly Daoist.


The next two sections attempt to historicize and reconcile these two
histories, one philosophical and one scientific, by turning to the
intellectual and social contexts for the development of science in
China. The fourth section focuses on concepts shared by the
practitioners and texts of early philosophy and science. The
fifth section turns to an intellectual divergence between generalist
and technical specialist knowledge through the categorization of texts
in a chapter of the dynastic history of the Han dynasty (Han
shu). The sixth section takes up the social context of the
practitioners of the early sciences and their relations to
philosophical texts and traditions. The last section surveys the
early sciences, with specific interest in areas of close relationship
between the sciences and Chinese philosophy, especially in the areas of
cosmology, astronomy, mathematics and medicine.

Social and Political Thought in Chinese Philosophy,0.4481690227985382,0.4907287657260895,"

Issues in social and political thought have been central to Chinese
philosophy from its earliest moments down to the present day. Neither
“social” nor “political” have ready correlates
in Chinese prior to the nineteenth century, but Chinese thinkers
consistently have been concerned with understanding how both
individuals and institutions have broad effects in what we can call
both social and political modes. In some cases, the philosophers
narrowly focus on governance and the state, but in many other cases,
no firm distinction is made between the realms of political, social,
and even family or individual. The scope of social and political
thought, and its relation to other concerns like individual ethics,
are discussed in
 Section 1.

The bulk of this entry is arranged chronologically, beginning with the
most important texts of the classical (or pre-Imperial) era; then
briefly attending to developments in the early Imperial era; next
looking more carefully at some of the key developments in the 800-year
Neo-Confucian era; and ending with Chinese social and political
thinking over the last 150 years. The organization within each section
differs because of differences in our sources. While theories
concerning the composition and dating of classical texts remain
intensely controversial, it is at least clear that our default should
not be to treat these texts as the products of single authors at a
single time, much less as representing the theories of
well-established schools of thought. Instead, it makes sense to take
individual texts, and sometimes individual chapters, as our basic
units of analysis. The nature and authorship of sources are clearer as
we move into later eras, and so a topical organization makes sense for
subsequent sections of the entry.

Several questions are central to the teachings and debates that make
up Chinese social and political thought, among which the issue of how
to sustain “order (zhi)”—often understood
more particularly as “harmony (he)”—is the
most basic. To what degree should we rely on institutions (and of what
kinds?), and to what degree is human leadership crucial? What sorts of
roles, relationships, or hierarchies should structure our societies,
and how are they justified? Can they be challenged or changed? Insofar
as society is divided into rulers and ruled, what are the
responsibilities that each owes to the other, and why? We will see
that social and political topics routinely connect up with other
aspects of Chinese philosophy—for example, answers to some of
the questions just raised lead to further ethical, epistemic, or
metaphysical questions—but for the most part it is still
possible to make sense of social and political thought in its own
terms.

Translating and Interpreting Chinese Philosophy,0.671676516532898,0.4855761229991913,"
Issues and problems of interpretation of written texts are distinct
from issues and problems of translations of them, but the two can
rarely be analyzed apart from each other. Moreover, both are closely
related by matters of language. Difficulties encountered in
translation of texts obviously generate difficulties in interpreting
them, and vice versa: the less confidence we have that we
understand what a text is about the more difficult it is to be
confident of our own (or anyone else’s) translation of it.
Thus an appreciation of problems discussed in this essay must begin
with an examination of the issues and problems stemming from the
classical language in which Chinese philosophers wrote and edited
their texts long ago, which will not only be necessary for
understanding and evaluating the texts themselves, but perhaps useful
as well for seeing some more general issues in metaphilosophy,
cross-cultural philosophy, the philosophy of language, and the
philosophy of mind in a somewhat different light.
 A second reason for the complexity of the topics related to this
entry is that some knowledge of the early philosophical—and
other—texts were and are prerequisite for understanding all
later philosophy because of the frequency of the references to them,
and also because they provided the basic model for the writing of the
later ones. Unfortunately most of these early Chinese texts have come
down to us only in corrupted form, increasing significantly the number
and variety of issues and problems of translating and interpreting
them, especially if our primary concern is to provide exegeses and
translations of them in terms of what they meant to the people who
first wrote and read them.
Moreover, the texts as we have them in English today have been
variously translated and interpreted by scholars and others with very
different backgrounds and interests for most of the past two
centuries: missionaries first, followed by merchants and diplomats
long-term resident in China, followed in the 20th century
by academics from a wide variety of disciplines, including history,
literature, linguistics, religion, Asian Studies (sinology), and now,
for the past several decades, philosophers. Needless to say, many
different translations and interpretations of virtually all of the
classical texts mirror closely the disparate concerns and agendas of
their publishers. They all do, however, share a decidedly Western
orientation in style, outlook, methodology, and more; seldom are
things viewed from the Chinese perspective, and consequently charges
of a Eurocentric bias in Chinese philosophy as a field of study are
unfortunately not without merit, increasing yet again the problems of
interpreting them appropriately.
In addition to the unusual nature of the classical Chinese
language, corrupted texts, and the variety of people who have worked
with them, a fourth reason for the complexity of the topic of this
entry is also the reason significantly responsible for its being the
only one of its kind in this Encyclopedia. There are no entries under
“Translating and Interpreting…” for Greek
philosophy, for example, nor German Idealism or French Postmodernism.
Even Indian philosophy lacks such an entry. This fact should bring
home not just the singularity of the classical Chinese written
language, compared to contemporary languages derived from the
proto-Sanskrit Indo-European family of languages written in alphabet
scripts, but remind us as well of the greater distance between Chinese
and other cultures from past to present. This is in good measure due
to geography: India and Greece have been in contact since before the
Alexandrian conquests, but the Himalayas, Xinjiang and Gobi deserts,
and the East China Sea made for a fairly solitary cultural development
in China that for many centuries hindered cross-cultural intercourse
except for the cultures on its periphery, Korea, Japan, and areas of
Southeast Asia. The Silk Roads notwithstanding, we find few
cross-cultural western links with the Chinese as we do for the Indian
(as, e.g., the Hindu god of fire Agni with Latin ignis, root
of English “ignite”). It is not necessarily that China is
the ultimate “Other” for Europeans and for writers in
European traditions, but rather that its heritage is much like
European traditions in many of its formal dimensions, yet so different
in details, and that writers in European traditions have only come
upon the scope and depth of that heritage comparatively recently. It
is not for nothing that Leibniz referred to China as the
“Oriental Europe” (Leibniz WoC: 12 [1708]).
After coming to understand how the classical Chinese language
itself poses problems for translators and interpreters we will then
examine other issues methodological, metaphysical, and comparative
relating to the reading of classical texts which tend to combine
exegetical and translation concerns.
The primary focus will be on those issues in dispute among scholars
in the field (not alone philosophers) which have philosophical
implications, attempting balanced accounts of both the disputes and the
implications. At times authors will be quoted at some length to insure
that their positions have not been distorted in the course of their
narration.  
As noted above, the linguistic focus will be somewhat narrow
temporally—by Chinese standards, at least: the period from
roughly the 7th through the 1st centuries
BCE. Most of the framing texts that became canonical in one tradition
or another were written, compiled, edited, and much else during this
period, and the classical language grew and was maturing at the same
time. It continued to grow during the whole of later Chinese history,
and canonical texts were added to the corpus throughout the same
period; but the bases for both were laid during the earlier period,
some knowledge of which were (and are) requisite for interpreting and
translating them.
None of what has been said up to this point is to suggest that
studying Chinese language and early thought is only for the
classically curious and linguistically intrepid. There has been an
explosion of scholarly growth in classical Chinese studies over the
past half-century, sufficient in both breadth and depth to allow
non-specialists to read translations of Chinese philosophical texts
with sensitivity and understanding. Translations of primary and
secondary texts and philosophical commentaries thereon have grown
apace, with a multiplicity of exegetical orientations, as have
literary, historical, religious, and other studies that collectively
have been shrinking the claimed mysteriousness of the East almost to
the vanishing point. There are, for instance, over 150 translations in
English alone of the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching), and a
dozen different renditions of the Confucian Analects are in
common use today in courses dealing with Chinese thought. Thus a
paucity of materials can no longer be used as an excuse for not
including classical Chinese philosophical texts in undergraduate
courses, or indeed in the several philosophical discourses now current
in professional circles. Some rudimentary knowledge of how the
language works can also be of value to readers in their academic
studies and/or participation in these discourses, not least by helping
them in understanding and analyzing how and why both translations and
interpretations of Chinese philosophical texts can and do differ from
each other—at times in significant ways, thus enabling them to
evaluate their readings in the subject matter for themselves. It may
serve as well to see some contemporary issues in philosophy of
language, or mind, or in metaphysics from a slightly different
perspective, and for all these reasons this entry may also serve in a
small way as a “state of the art” essay on the field.

Wang Yangming,0.4684902429580689,0.4557097852230072,"
Wang Yangming (1472–1529) was a Chinese statesman, general,
and Neo–Confucian philosopher.  He was one of the leading
critics of the orthodox Neo–Confucianism of Zhu Xi
(1130–1200).  Wang is perhaps best known for his doctrine of the
“unity of knowing and acting.”

Zhuangzi,0.4751170873641968,0.4274154603481293,"


Zhuangzi (Chuang-tzu 莊子 “Master Zhuang” late
4th century BC) is the pivotal figure in Classical Philosophical
Daoism. The Zhuangzi is a compilation of his and others’
writings at the pinnacle of the philosophically subtle Classical
period in China (5th–3rd century BC). The period was marked by humanist
and naturalist reflections on normativity shaped by the metaphor of a
dào—a social or a natural path. Traditional
orthodoxy understood Zhuangzi as an anti-rational, credulous follower
of a mystical Laozi. That traditional view dominated mainstream
readings of the text. Recent archeological discoveries have largely
laid that ancient orthodoxy to rest. 
 Six centuries later, elements of Zhuangzi’s naturalism,
along with themes found in the text attributed to Laozi helped shape Chan
 Buddhism (Japanese Zen)—a distinctively Chinese, naturalist blend of
Daoism and Buddhism with its emphasis on focused engagement in our
everyday ways of life. 
 This wide range of views of Zhuangzi stem from the style of the
text. Zhuangzi’s prose style is its own distinctive literary
treasure. The central feature is the parable, typified as a discussion
between imaginary or real interlocutors. Typically short, pithy, and
amusing, his tales are both accessible and philosophically
seductive—they both entertain and make you think. A respite from
the dry moralizing of Confucians, the text was always a favorite of
the Chinese intellectual, literati class. The Zhuangzi also
attracts modern Western readers with its thoroughgoing naturalism,
philosophical subtlety, and sophisticated humor, all set in a
strikingly different conceptual scheme and its distant, exotic
context. 

Philosophically, Zhuangzi strikes us as more the Hume of his tradition
than a system builder like Plato, Aristotle or Kant. He drew skeptical
and relativist implications from a naturalist approach to normative
guidance. His treatment of natural dàos focused on the
norms governing correct use of language. His ethical relativism grew
out of an indexical model of how natural conditions shape the norms
governing the use of terms.

This linguistic analysis emphasized indexical contexts especially for
the evaluative terms of choices of natural paths of behavior
(dàos). Zhuangzi’s foils were mainly credulous and
dogmatic Confucian humanists, particularly the innate intuitionist
absolutism of a type familiar from the Mencius. He also took
his linguistic insights to undermine Mozi’s pragmatic utilitarian
alternative to Confucianism. He engaged seriously with later Mohist,
realist, linguistic theories, both acknowledging their challenge to
primitive quietism (the anti-language view familiar in The
Laozi) and yet remaining skeptical of the realist conclusion. His
most frequent co-discussant in the text was Hui Shi, a rival
linguistic relativist. 

The following highlights the central interpretive controversies then
develops a philosophical interpretation that fits the Zhuangzi into
the classical philosophical dialogue.

Zhu Xi,0.4557999670505524,0.4547096192836762,"
Zhu Xi, the preeminent Neo-Confucian (daoxue) master of
the Southern Song (1126–1271), is generally ranked as second
only to Confucius (551–479 BCE) in influence and as rivaling
Zhuangzi (fourth century BCE) in philosophic acumen in the Chinese
philosophical tradition. A leading scholar and classicist as well as
sharp intellect and devoted practitioner, Zhu Xi worked out a
philosophically compelling synthesis of the ideas of the Northern
Song (960–1126 CE) masters Zhou Dunyi (1017–73), Zhang
Zai (1020–77), and the brothers Cheng Yi (1033–1107) and
Cheng Hao (1032–85). Intriguingly, his idea of a holistic
synthetic approach itself may have been inspired in part by Huayan
Buddhism (Ivanhoe 2000:
47–49).[1] 
Over time, Zhu Xi’s Neo-Confucian
synthesis proved to be a potent philosophic catalyst for his
intellectual supporters and opponents alike, until the fall of
Imperial China in 1911 and beyond. His influence gradually extended
to Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, as well, each of which adapted his
thought along with the Confucian classics and traditions in its own
way.  Besides synthesizing key Northern Song Neo-Confucian ideas, Zhu
researched and reflected on the received Five Classics (Changes,
Odes, History, Rites, and Spring and Autumn Annals),
and compiled, edited, and commented on a compendium of essential
Confucian texts, the Great Learning (Daxue),
the Analects (Lunyu) of Confucius, the Book of
Mencius (Mengzi), and the Doctrine of the Mean
(Zhongyong), titled the Four Books
(Sishu).
Notably, from the Great Learning Zhu adapted and distilled
the methodology of investigating things to extend knowledge while from
the Mean he stressed attuning oneself to attain utmost
propriety. Investigating things incorporated reading and classical
studies but ensured one’s practical grasp of and personal
resonance with the pulse of life: nature and phenomena as well as
society and human relations and concerns (Gardner 1986, 1990).
Attuning oneself involved reverent concentration and mindful
reflection and practice. A century later, Yuan dynasty
(1271–1368) officialdom adopted Zhu Xi’s edition of
the Four Books as the basis for the Imperial Examination
System, in effect canonizing it until the termination of the imperial
examination system toward the end of the Qing dynasty
(1644–1911) in 1908. The change from the Five Classics
to the Four Books as the basis of the imperial examination
system resulted in a reform and renewal of the Confucian tradition and
outlook. It effected a restoration of Confucius’ original
concern with personal ethical cultivation, realization, and practice
from the more bureaucratic, careerist approach taken by many
Confucians of the preceding Han and Tang dynasties (206 BCE–905
CE) that had weakened the tradition spiritually. Zhu Xi’s spirit
and thought were deeply rooted in the original teachings of Confucius
and his early school, as well as in the seminal ideas of the Northern
Song masters, and exerted a profound influence in China and around
East Asia for centuries.

Roderick Chisholm,0.7388919591903687,0.4760199189186096,"


Roderick Milton Chisholm is widely regarded as one of the most
creative, productive, and influential American philosophers of the
20th Century. Chisholm worked in epistemology,
metaphysics, ethics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and
other areas. His work constitutes a grand philosophical system
somewhat in the manner of Leibniz or Descartes. Chisholm
continually refined — and sometimes utterly revised — his
views. He was a prolific writer. The bibliography of his
written work in [LLP] contains citations of 320 items, including
journal articles, reviews, and books. His work in epistemology
alone would probably guarantee his position as an outstanding figure in
American philosophy. Yet he made major contributions in several
areas of metaphysics and ethics as well. As a result, it would be
impossible to give a comprehensive account of Chisholm's system
in a brief article. Thus, in this article we attempt to present
no more than a sketch of some of Chisholm's most distinctive and
important views. We do not claim to present his “final,

The Axiom of Choice,0.9078301191329956,0.7778857350349426,"


The principle of set theory known as the Axiom of Choice has
been hailed as “probably the most interesting and, in spite of
its late appearance, the most discussed axiom of mathematics, second
only to Euclid’s axiom of parallels which was introduced more than two
thousand years ago” (Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel & Levy 1973,
§II.4). The fulsomeness of this description might lead those
unfamiliar with the axiom to expect it to be as startling as, say, the
Principle of the Constancy of the Velocity of Light or the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle. But in fact the Axiom of Choice as it is
usually stated appears humdrum, even self-evident. For it amounts to
nothing more than the claim that, given any collection of mutually
disjoint nonempty sets, it is possible to assemble a new set—a
transversal or choice set—containing exactly
one element from each member of the given collection. Nevertheless,
this seemingly innocuous principle has far-reaching mathematical
consequences—many indispensable, some startling—and
has come to figure prominently in discussions on the foundations of
mathematics. It (or its equivalents) have been employed in countless
mathematical papers, and a number of monographs have been exclusively
devoted to it.

Sometimes a series of choices do not serve one’s concerns well even
though each choice in the series seems perfectly well suited to
serving one’s concerns. In such cases, one has a dynamic choice
problem. Otherwise put, one has a problem related to the fact that
one’s choices are spread out over time. There is a growing
philosophical literature, which crosses over into psychology and
economics, on the obstacles to effective dynamic choice. This
literature examines the challenging choice situations and problematic
preference structures that can prompt dynamic choice problems. It also
proposes solutions to such problems. Increasingly, familiar but
potentially puzzling phenomena—including, for example,
self-destructive addictive behavior and dangerous environmental
destruction—have been illuminated by dynamic choice theory. This
suggests that the philosophical and practical significance of dynamic
choice theory is quite broad.

Social Choice Theory,0.6951321959495544,0.903167724609375,"


Social choice theory is the study of collective decision processes and procedures.
It is not a single theory, but a cluster of models and results
concerning the aggregation of individual inputs (e.g., votes,
preferences, judgments, welfare) into collective outputs (e.g.,
collective decisions, preferences, judgments, welfare). Central
questions are: How can a group of individuals choose a winning outcome
(e.g., policy, electoral candidate) from a given set of options? What
are the properties of different voting systems? When is a voting system
democratic? How can a collective (e.g., electorate, legislature,
collegial court, expert panel, or committee) arrive at coherent
collective preferences or judgments on some issues, on the basis of its
members' individual preferences or judgments? How can we rank
different social alternatives in an order of social welfare? Social choice
theorists study these questions not just by looking at examples, but 
by developing general models and proving theorems.


Pioneered in the 18th century by Nicolas de Condorcet and
Jean-Charles de Borda and in the 19th century by Charles Dodgson (also
known as Lewis Carroll), social choice theory took off in the 20th
century with the works of Kenneth Arrow, Amartya Sen, and Duncan Black.
Its influence extends across economics, political science, philosophy,
mathematics, and recently computer science and biology. Apart from
contributing to our understanding of collective decision procedures,
social choice theory has applications in the areas of institutional
design, welfare economics, and social epistemology.

Citizenship,0.4418610334396362,0.6718446016311646,"

A citizen is a member of a political community who enjoys the rights
and assumes the duties of membership. This broad definition is
discernible, with minor variations, in the works of contemporary
authors as well as in the entry “citoyen” in
Diderot’s and d’Alembert’s
Encyclopédie
 [1753].[1]
 Notwithstanding this common starting-point and certain shared
 references,[2]
 the differences between 18th century discussions and
contemporary debates are significant. The
encyclopédiste’s main preoccupation,
understandable for one living in a monarchy, was the relationship
between the concepts ‘citizen’ and ‘subject’.
Were they the same (as Hobbes asserted) or contradictory (as a reading
of Aristotle
 suggested)?[3]
 This issue is less central today as we tend to take for granted that
a liberal democratic regime is the appropriate starting-point for our
reflections. This does not mean, however, that the concept has become
uncontroversial. After a long period of relative calm, there has been
a dramatic upsurge in philosophical interest in citizenship since the
early
 1990s.[4]

Two broad challenges have led theorists to re-examine the concept:
first, the need to acknowledge the internal diversity of contemporary
liberal democracies; second, the pressures wrought by globalization on
the territorial, sovereign state. We will focus on each of these two
challenges, examining how they prompted new discussions and
disagreements.

The entry has four sections. The first examines the main dimensions of
citizenship (legal, political, identity) and sees how they are
instantiated in very different ways within the two dominant models:
the republican and the liberal. The feminist critique of the
private/public distinction, central to both models, serves as a bridge
to the entry’s second section. It focuses upon two important
debates about the implications of social and cultural pluralism to
conceptions of citizenship: first, should they recognize, rather than
transcend, difference and, if so, does this recognition affect
citizenship’s purported role in strengthening social cohesion?
Second, how are we to understand the relation between citizenship and
nationality under conditions of pluralism? The third section discusses
the challenges which globalisation poses to theories of citizenship.
These theories have long taken for granted the idea that
citizenship’s necessary context is the sovereign, territorial
state. This premise is being increasingly contested by those who
question the state’s right to determine who is accepted as a
member and/or claim that citizenship can be meaningful beyond the
boundaries of the nation-state. The entry’s fourth and final
section looks at how recent discussions in the fields of disability
rights and animal rights challenge a basic premise of the literature
on citizenship since Aristotle: the idea that discursive rationality
constitutes a threshold condition to citizenship.

Civic Education,0.4670716822147371,0.646074116230011,"

In its broadest definition, “civic education” means all
the processes that affect people’s beliefs, commitments,
capabilities, and actions as members or prospective members of
communities. Civic education need not be intentional or deliberate;
institutions and communities transmit values and norms without meaning
to. It may not be beneficial: sometimes people are civically educated
in ways that disempower them or impart harmful values and goals. It is
certainly not limited to schooling and the education of children and
youth. Families, governments, religions, and mass media are just some
of the institutions involved in civic education, understood as a
lifelong
 process.[1]
 A rightly famous example is Tocqueville’s often quoted
observation that local political engagement is a form of civic
education: “Town meetings are to liberty what primary schools
are to science; they bring it within the people’s reach, they
teach men how to use and how to enjoy it.”

Nevertheless, most scholarship that uses the phrase “civic
education” investigates deliberate programs of instruction
within schools or colleges, in contrast to paideia (see
below) and other forms of citizen preparation that involve a whole
culture and last a lifetime. There are several good reasons for the
emphasis on schools. First, empirical evidence shows that civic habits
and values are relatively easily to influence and change while people
are still young, so schooling can be effective when other efforts to
educate citizens would fail (Sherrod, Flanagan, and Youniss, 2002).
Another reason is that schools in many countries have an explicit
mission to educate students for citizenship. As Amy Gutmann points
out, school-based education is our most deliberate form of human
instruction (1987, 15). Defining the purposes and methods of civic
education in schools is a worthy topic of public debate. Nevertheless,
it is important not to lose sight of the fact that civic education
takes place at all stages of life and in many venues other than
schools.

Whether defined narrowly or broadly, civic education raises empirical
questions: What causes people to develop durable habits, values,
knowledge, and skills relevant to their membership in communities? Are
people affected differently if they vary by age, social or cultural
background, and starting assumptions? For example, does a high school
civics course have lasting effects on various kinds of students, and
what would make it more effective? 

From the 1960s until the 1980s, empirical questions concerning civic
education were relatively neglected, mainly because of a prevailing
assumption that intentional programs would not have significant
and durable effects, given the more powerful influences of social
class and ideology (Cook, 1985). Since then, many research studies and
program evaluations have found substantial effects, and most social
scientists who study the topic now believe that educational practices,
such as discussion of controversial issues, hands-on action, and
reflection, can influence students (Sherrod, Torney-Purta &
Flanagan, 2010).

The philosophical questions have been less explored, but they are
essential. For example:



Who has the full rights and obligations of a citizen? This question is
especially contested with regard to children, immigrant aliens, and
individuals who have been convicted of felonies. 


In what communities ought we see ourselves as citizens? The
nation-state is not the only candidate; some people see themselves as
citizens of local geographical communities, organizations, movements,
loosely-defined groups, or even the world as a whole.


What responsibilities does a citizen of each kind of community have?
Do all members of each community have the same responsibilities, or
ought there be significant differences, for example, between elders
and children, or between leaders and other members?


What is the relationship between a good regime and good citizenship?
Aristotle held that there were several acceptable types of regimes,
and each needed different kinds of citizens. That makes the question
of good citizenship relative to the regime-type. But other theorists
have argued for particular combinations of regime and citizen
competence. For example, classical liberals endorsed regimes that
would make relatively modest demands on citizens, both because they
were skeptical that people could rise to higher demands and because
they wanted to safeguard individual liberty against the state. Civic
republicans have seen a certain kind of citizenship--highly active and
deliberative--as constitutive of a good life, and therefore recommend
a republican regime because it permits good citizenship.


Who may decide what constitutes good citizenship? If we consider, for
example, students enrolled in public schools in the United States,
should the decision about what values, habits, and capabilities they
should learn belong to their parents, their teachers, the children
themselves, the local community, the local or state government, or the
nation-state? We may reach different conclusions when thinking about
5-year-olds and adult college students. As Sheldon Wolin warned:
“…[T]he inherent danger…is that the identity given
to the collectivity by those who exercise power will reflect the needs
of power rather than the political possibilities of a complex
collectivity” (1989, 13). For some regimes—fascist or
communist, for example—this is not perceived as a danger at all
but, instead, the very purpose of their forms of civic education. In
democracies, the question is more complex because public institutions
may have to teach people to be good democratic citizens, but they can
decide to do so in ways that reinforce the power of the state and
reduce freedom.


What means of civic education are ethically appropriate? It
might, for example, be effective to punish students who fail to
memorize patriotic statements, or to pay students for community
service, but the ethics of those approaches would be controversial. An
educator might engage students in open discussions of current events
because of a commitment to treating them as autonomous agents,
regardless of the consequences. As with other topics, the proper
relationship between means and ends is contested.


These questions are rarely treated together as part of comprehensive
theories of civic education; instead, they arise in passing in works
about politics or education. Some of these questions have never been
much explored by professional philosophers, but they arise frequently
in public debates about citizenship.

Civic Humanism,0.4245910346508026,0.6146483421325684,"


A variant of republicanism indicating active, participatory,
patriotic citizenship as well as the ethos and educational ideal that
goes with it. The term was coined in the context of the embattled
Weimar Republic and its genesis is deeply marked by the traditions of
German historical scholarship. It was first used by the historian Hans
Baron to describe an upsurge of patriotic republicanism as a response
to foreign aggression and despotism, informed by the revival of
classical models in Renaissance Florence. This movement is also taken
as a decisive turning point away from medieval ways and towards
liberating modernity.


The term civic humanism has gained wide circulation and influence
since its reception into English-language historical writing. Its
diffusion is closely connected with the ‘contextualist
school’ in the history of ideas. Its original, historically
circumscribed meaning was extended to indicate a political language or
discourse extending from classical origins to epochal manifestations
— ‘moments’ — in the ‘Atlantic
republican tradition’. Reinterpretation of parts of the
historical record of seventeenth century England and pre-revolutionary
America as expressions of civic humanism provided a significant
counterweight to the hitherto predominant Whig or Lockean-Liberal
paradigm of constitutional development.


No longer necessarily tied to the interpretation of particular
historical periods the term became part of the vocabulary of
communitarianism and more generally of ideological opposition to
liberalism understood as acquisitive individualism. It remained
nonetheless important for the value of civic humanism as a paradigm of
politics and civil society that it not be considered a mere
ideological abstraction but that it be believed to have roots in the
lived experience of the English-speaking polities. In the context of
the debate about the ideological sources of the American Founding the
term “civic humanism” serves to separate strands of
republican thought; it distinguishes a philosophic temper and language
and not a party political alignment such as Jeffersonian
Republicanism. Beyond this relatively circumscribed usage the concept
has entered the language and is used rather loosely and mostly with
positive connotations to refer to public-spirited citizenship with
varying degrees of exactitude.


In terms of sober historical scholarship the greatest value of the
concept has been that of a heuristic device leading to important
corrections of received ideas. As such it is itself now subject to
serious criticism.

Civil Disobedience,0.3792708218097687,0.7433108687400818,"


What makes a breach of law an act of civil disobedience? When is
civil disobedience morally justified? How should the law respond to
people who engage in civil disobedience? Discussions of civil
disobedience have tended to focus on the first two of these questions.
On the most widely accepted account of civil disobedience, famously
defended by John Rawls (1971), civil disobedience is a public,
non-violent and conscientious breach of law undertaken with the aim of
bringing about a change in laws or government policies. On this
account, people who engage in civil disobedience are willing to
accept the legal consequences of their actions, as this shows their
fidelity to the rule of law. Civil disobedience, given its place at the
boundary of fidelity to law, is said to fall between legal protest, on
the one hand, and conscientious refusal, revolutionary action, militant
protest and organised forcible resistance, on the other hand.


This picture of civil disobedience raises many questions. Why must
civil disobedience be non-violent? Why must it be public, in the sense
of forewarning authorities of the intended action, since publicity
gives authorities an opportunity to interfere with the action? Why must
people who engage in civil disobedience be willing to accept
punishment? A general challenge to Rawls's conception of civil
disobedience is that it is overly narrow, and as such it predetermines
the conclusion that most acts of civil disobedience are morally
justifiable. A further challenge is that Rawls applies his theory of
civil disobedience only to the context of a nearly just society,
leaving unclear whether a credible conception of either the nature or
the justification of civil disobedience could follow the same lines in
the context of less just societies. Some broader accounts of civil
disobedience offered in response to Rawls's view (Raz 1979;
Greenawalt 1987) will be examined in the first section of this
entry.


This entry has four main sections. The first considers some
definitional issues and contrasts civil disobedience with both ordinary
offences and other types of dissent. The second analyses two sets of
factors relevant to the justification of civil disobedience; one set
concerns the disobedient's particular choice of action, the other
concerns her motivation for so acting. The third section examines whether people have a right to engage in civil
disobedience. The fourth considers what kind of legal response to civil
disobedience is appropriate.

Civil Rights,0.44516876339912415,0.7556712031364441,"

In contemporary political thought, the term ‘civil rights’
is indissolubly linked to the struggle for equality of American blacks
during the 1950s and 60s. The aim of that struggle was to secure the
status of equal citizenship in a liberal democratic state. Civil
rights are the basic legal rights a person must possess in order to
have such a status. They are the rights that constitute free and equal
citizenship and include personal, political, and economic rights. No
contemporary thinker of significance holds that such rights can be
legitimately denied to a person on the basis of race, color, sex,

Samuel Clarke,0.5912495851516724,0.375455379486084,"

Samuel Clarke (1675–1729) was the most influential British
metaphysician and theologian in the generation between Locke and
Berkeley, and only Shaftesbury rivals him in ethics. In all three
areas he was very critical of Hobbes, Spinoza, and Toland. Deeply
influenced by Newton, Clarke was critical of Descartes’
metaphysics of space and body because of the experimental evidence for
Newtonianian doctrines of space, the vacuum, atoms, and attraction and
because he believed Descartes’ identifying body with extension
and removing final causes from nature had furthered irreligion and had
naturally developed into Spinozism.

Clarke sided with Locke and Newton against Descartes in denying that
we have knowledge of the essence of substances, even though we can be
sure that there are at least two kinds of substances (mental and
material) because their properties (thinking and divisibility) are
incompatible. He defended natural religion against the naturalist view
that nature constitutes a self-sufficient system and defended revealed
religion against deism. Clarke adopted Newton’s natural
philosophy early on. Through his association with Newton, Clarke was
the de facto spokesperson for Newtonianism in the first half
the eighteenth century, not only explaining the natural science but
also providing a metaphysical support and theological interpretation
for it.

In what follows, we use “W” as an abbreviation to cite
passages from the four-volume The Works, edited posthumously
by Benjamin Hoadly. Two recent editions of Clarke’s major works
are more widely available and thus cited here as well: “D”
for passages in A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God
and Other Writings in Vailati (1998), and “CC” for
passages in The Correspondence of Samuel Clarke and Anthony
Collins (Uzgalis (ed.) 2011). References to the Leibniz-Clarke
correspondence (available in many print and online editions) include
the letter and section number preceded by an “L” for
Leibniz and “C” for Clarke (e.g., L 1.4 refers to
Leibniz’s first letter, section four).

Doxography of Ancient Philosophy,0.6841533780097961,0.1020892783999443,"


The great majority of Greek (and Roman) philosophical writings have
been irretrievably lost. But this loss is made good to some extent not
only by quotations from lost works recorded by later writers, but also
by the varieties of ancient reportage that are extant. The modern name
for these forms of reportage is ‘doxography’, which could
be be translated ‘tenet-writing’. Broadly speaking,
doxography encompasses those writings, or parts of writings, in which
the author presents philosophical views of some or other of the
ancient philosophers or schools, in some or other areas, or on some or
other topics, of philosophy, whether with or without presentation of
the argumentation or analysis through which they offered philosophical
support or reasons in favor of their ‘tenets’, and whether
or not they also include critical evaluations and comments of the
author's own. In other words, these are works (or sections of works)
taking as their subject matter the tenets or doctrines of the
philosophers, rather than independent works of philosophy in which the
author addresses in the first instance issues or topics of philosophy,
with ancillary discussion along the way of the opinions of other
philosophers. The terms for tenets, or views, in ancient Greek
are doxai or
dogmata, in Latin opiniones; those for doctrines are, in
Greek, areskonta, translated into Latin as placita. But
note that these designations were used interchangeably.

Climate Science,0.920387089252472,0.5663609504699707,"

Climate science investigates the structure and dynamics of
earth’s climate system. It seeks to understand how global,
regional and local climates are maintained as well as the processes by
which they change over time. In doing so, it employs observations and
theory from a variety of domains, including meteorology, oceanography,
physics, chemistry and more. These resources also inform the
development of computer models of the climate system, which are a
mainstay of climate research today. This entry provides an overview of
some of the core concepts and practices of contemporary climate
science as well as philosophical work that engages with them. The
focus is primarily on epistemological and methodological issues that
arise when producing climate datasets and when constructing, using and
evaluating climate models. Some key questions and findings about
anthropogenic climate change are also discussed.

The Ethics of Clinical Research,0.5269761085510254,0.9042136669158936,"
Clinical research attempts to address a relatively straightforward,
and extremely important challenge: how do we determine whether one 
medical intervention is better than another, whether it offers greater clinical benefit and/or poses fewer risks? Clinicians may one day be
able to answer these questions by relying on computer models, thereby
avoiding reliance on clinical research and the ethical concerns it
raises. Until that day, clinical researchers begin by testing
potential new medical interventions in the laboratory, and often in
animals. While these methods can provide valuable information and, in
the case of animal research, raise important ethical issues of their
own, potential new interventions eventually must be tested in
humans. Potential new interventions which work miracles in test tubes
and in mice, often leave humans untouched, or worse off.
The human tests of a medical intervention typically pose some risks to subjects no matter how many laboratory and animal tests have preceded them. In this way, the process of collecting data to improve health and well-being exposes research subjects to risks for the benefit of future patients. These studies thus provide a clear
example of the central ethical challenge posed by clinical
research: When is it ethically permissible to expose research subjects to risks of harm for the benefit of others? The present entry focuses on this concern, and canvasses the
most prominent attempts to address it. The present entry largely
brackets the range of interesting and important ethical challenges that
arise in the course of conducting clinical research: How should it be
reviewed? Who may conduct it? What must potential subjects understand
to give valid consent? May it be conducted in countries that will not
be able to afford the intervention being tested? Do investigators have
any obligations to treat unrelated medical conditions they uncover in
the course of their research?
One might attempt to address the central ethical challenge
by limiting clinical research to the medical setting, offering
experimental interventions to patients who want to try them. This
approach, which has the virtue of evaluating interventions in the
process of trying to help individual patients, can make sense for comparisons of two or more interventions that are widely accepted and already in clinical use. In contrast, this approach poses enormous
scientific and practical problems with respect to testing new interventions. On the practical side, who would be
willing to manufacture a new intervention without knowing whether it
works? What dose should be used? How often should the new drug be
taken? More importantly, this approach might not yield reliable
information as to whether the new treatment is useful or harmful until
hundreds, perhaps thousands of people have received it. Clinical
research is designed to address these concerns by systematically
exposing a small number of individuals, including very sick ones, to
potential new treatments. Many activities, driving a car, smoking a
cigarette, flushing our waste down the drain, expose others to risks of
harm. Nonetheless, there has been surprisingly little philosophical
analysis of the conditions under which it is acceptable to do this
(Hayenhjelm and Wolff 2012). Therefore, in addition to being of value
in its own right, evaluation of the ethics of clinical research
provides an opportunity to consider one of the more fundamental
concerns in moral theory: when is it acceptable to expose some
individuals to risks of harm for the potential benefit of others?

Cloning,0.5284389257431029,0.9422199726104736,"
Dolly the sheep, the first mammal cloned from a somatic (body) cell,
came into the world innocent as a lamb. However, soon after the
announcement of her birth in February 1997 (Wilmut et al.,
1997) she caused panic and controversy. An important, and for many
people troubling question arose: if the cloning of sheep is possible,
will scientists soon start cloning humans as well; and if they did,
would this be wrong or unwise?


For most people, Dolly was really a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
She represented a first undesirable and dangerous step to applying
reproductive cloning in humans, something that many agreed should never
be done. Only a small minority thought it was permissible, or even
morally obligatory to conduct further research into human reproductive
cloning. Some had no strong objections to it, but did not see any
reason to promote it either.


Dolly is now stuffed and set up for display in the National Museum
of Scotland. Many countries or jurisdictions have legally banned human
cloning or are in the process of doing so. In some countries, including
France and Singapore, reproductive cloning of humans is a criminal
offence. In 2005, the United Nations adopted a ‘Declaration on
Human Cloning’, which calls for a universal ban on human cloning.
The debate on human reproductive cloning seems to have drawn to a
close. However, since reproductive cloning of mammals has
become routine in several countries, there is reason to believe that at
some point in the future, humans will be cloned too. Moreover, even if
reproductive cloning will not be possible in the near future,
cloning for research and therapeutic purposes is likely to be.


This entry describes the most important areas of disagreement
regarding the ethics of cloning. I will focus on human cloning (as
opposed to animal cloning), since human cloning has been the focus of
the cloning debate.

Cockburn’s philosophical reputation rests largely upon her polemical
works in defense of John Locke and Samuel Clarke. While she displays a
range of interests in these works, her primary concern is to defend a
moral epistemology that combines elements of Locke’s epistemology with
a proto-Clarkean moral fitness theory. Cockburn’s morality is best
described as a broadly rationalistic natural law theory that draws
strongly on Locke’s concept of reflection. According to Cockburn we
discover the foundations for moral rules through reflection upon human
nature and divine nature. Humans are then able to determine moral right
and wrong by assessing the fitness or unfitness of given acts with
reference to these natures.

Coercion,0.4913980066776276,0.7001897096633911,"


The concept of coercion has two different faces,
corresponding to the two parties involved in its most ordinary cases.
On one face, it picks out a technique agents (coercers) can use to get
other agents to do or not do something. On the other face, it picks out
a kind of reason for why agents (coercees) sometimes do or refrain from
doing something. Coercion is typically thought to carry with it several
important implications, including that it diminishes the targeted
agent's freedom and responsibility, and that it is a (pro
tanto) wrong and/or violation of right. Nonetheless, few believe
that it is always unjustified, since it seems that no society could
function without some authorized uses of coercion. It helps keep the
bloody minded and recalcitrant from harming others, and seems also to
be an indispensable technique in the rearing of children. A
state's legitimacy and sovereignty is sometimes thought to depend
on its ability to use coercion effectively and to monopolize its use
within its territory against competitors, both internal and
external.


Because of its usefulness and its sometimes devastating effects,
coercion is a matter of longstanding political and ethical concern.
Nonetheless, there has been little sustained scholarly attention to its
nature until recently; historically, many seem to have been willing to
accept the concept of coercion as a primitive. Since the 1970s,
however, the nature and function of coercion has come in for
significant philosophical discussion. This flourishing of interest may
have been sparked by social unrest (including efforts to suppress it)
and the success of some mass non-violent resistance movements. Also of
import were tensions between the U.S. and U.S.S.R., centered on their
arsenals of nuclear weapons, by which each aimed to deter the other
from disastrous behavior, including the launching of a nuclear
first-strike. More recently, philosophical interest in globalization
and terrorism have added to interest in coercion. The new found
interest in the topic coincides with a marked change in the way
philosophers have understood its nature. Though the pace of study has
slowed somewhat since 1990, the nature of coercion and its effects
remains a matter of dispute.


Sometimes the term “coercion” is used in popular speech
with a quite broad sense. For instance, one hears
“coercion” used to describe social pressures (e.g., the
need to conform to peer expectations or to placate one's
parents); or the constraining or manipulative effects of advertising,
one's upbringing, or the structuring of society more generally
(e.g., the necessity of participating in a capitalist economy). It is
also sometimes treated as a quite general concept encompassing almost
any sort of interpersonal infringement on one's rights. Such uses
are not wholly foreign to philosophical discussions (see, e.g.,
Ripstein 2004). Nonetheless, the following discussion will focus on a
narrower sense of the term more in line with its use by major
historical philosophical writers and contemporary theorists alike. This
usage will rule out, by stipulation, such things as mere disapproval,
emotional manipulation, or wheedling. (What is “ruled in”
is subject to dispute, as is discussed below.) This minimal setting of
boundaries still leaves considerable room for disagreement over how
best to understand coercion's workings, its preconditions, and
its effects.

Embodied Cognition,0.8147229552268982,0.4228634238243103,"


Cognition is embodied when it is deeply dependent upon features of
the physical body of an agent, that is, when aspects of the
agent's body beyond the brain play a significant causal or
physically constitutive role in cognitive processing.


In general, dominant views in the philosophy of mind and cognitive
science have considered the body as peripheral to understanding the
nature of mind and cognition. Proponents of embodied cognitive science
view this as a serious mistake. Sometimes the nature of the dependence
of cognition on the body is quite unexpected, and suggests new ways of
conceptualizing and exploring the mechanics of cognitive
processing.


Embodied cognitive science encompasses a loose-knit family of
research programs in the cognitive sciences that often share a
commitment to critiquing and even replacing traditional approaches to
cognition and cognitive processing. Empirical research on embodied
cognition has exploded in the past 10 years. As the bibliography for
this article attests, the various bodies of work that will be discussed
represent a serious alternative to the investigation of cognitive
phenomena.


Relatively recent work on the embodiment of cognition provides much
food for thought for empirically-informed philosophers of mind. This is
in part because of the rich range of phenomena that embodied cognitive
science has studied. But it is also in part because those phenomena are
often thought to challenge dominant views of the mind, such as the
computational and representational theories of mind, at the heart of
traditional cognitive science. And they have sometimes been taken to
undermine standard positions in the philosophy of mind, such as the
idea that the mind is identical to, or even realized in, the brain.

Animal Cognition,0.7264748811721802,0.4569747447967529,"

The philosophical issues that relate to research on animal cognition
can be categorized into three groups: foundational issues about
whether non-human animals are the proper subject of psychological
investigation; methodological issues about how to study animal minds;
and more specific issues that arise from within the specific research
programs. 

While the study of animal cognition is largely an empirical endeavor,
the practice of science in this area relies on theoretical arguments
and assumptions — for example, on the nature of mind,
communication, and rationality. If nonhuman animals don’t have
beliefs, and if all cognitive systems have beliefs, then animals
wouldn’t be the proper subjects of cognitive studies. If animals
aren’t agents because their behavior isn’t caused by propositional
attitudes, and if all cognitive systems are agents, we get the same
conclusion. While there are arguments against animal minds, the
cognitive scientists studying animals largely accept that animals are
minded, cognitive systems. As demonstrated by the 2012
  Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness,
 many scientists also accept
 animal consciousness.
 

Many of the research programs investigating particular cognitive
capacities in different species raise philosophical questions and have
implications for philosophical theories, insofar as they impose
additional empirical constraints for naturalistically minded
philosophers. Traditional research paradigms in animal cognition are
similar to those in human cognition, and include an examination of
perception, learning, categorization, memory, spatial cognition,
numerosity, communication, language, social cognition, theory of mind
or mindreading, causal reasoning, and metacognition.

Scientists working within any one of these areas might use very
different methods, because there is no one discipline of animal
cognition. For example, social cognition could be studied by a
biologist who documents mutual gaze in mother-infant dyads across
primate species (e.g. Matsuzawa 2006b), an ethologist interested in
free-ranging canid social play behavior (e.g. Bekoff 2001), an
experimental psychologist testing theory of mind in an adult
symbol-trained chimpanzee (e.g. Premack & Woodruff 1978), an
anthropologist observing social games in capuchin monkey communities
(e.g. Perry et al. 2003), or a cognitive neuroscientist
investigating neural basis of gaze-following in primates (e.g. Emery
2000). Finally, findings about the cognitive abilities of animals
often play a role in debates about the
 moral status of animals,
 as well as in investigations into whether animals may engage in some
sort of moral practice.

Cognitive Disability and Moral Status,0.5281305909156799,0.7077006697654724,"

Why are cognitive disability and moral status thought to be
sufficiently connected to warrant a separate entry? The reason is that
individuals with cognitive disabilities have served as test cases in
debates about the moral relevance of possessing such intellectual
attributes as self-consciousness and practical rationality. If a
significant portion of human beings lacks self-consciousness and
practical rationality, then those attributes cannot by themselves
distinguish the way we treat cognitively developed human beings from
the way we treat non-human animals and human fetuses. If we cannot
experiment on or kill human beings who lack those attributes, then the
lack of those attributes alone cannot be what justifies animal
experimentation or abortion.

For the most part, the philosophers who have considered these claims
were not primarily concerned with the treatment or moral status of
cognitively disabled human beings—they sought to challenge
existing practices toward fetuses or animals, or the rationales for
such practices. But those claims have significant practical
implications for cognitively disabled human beings. If the
justification for treating living beings in certain ways does
rest to some extent on their possession or lack of intellectual
attributes, then it may be acceptable to treat cognitively disabled
human beings in ways that it would be unacceptable to treat
cognitively nondisabled humans. This implication, a kind of
philosophical blowback from the debates on animal rights and abortion,
has become the subject of sustained controversy in applied ethics.

Philosophers who question the moral status of human beings with the
most significant cognitive disabilities often compare them to animals
claimed to have similar or greater cognitive abilities (McMahan 1996,
2002, 2009; Singer 1993, 2009; and Wilkinson 2008 in Other Internet
Resources). Some critics find these comparisons unnecessary and
offensive (e.g., Carlson 2009; Carlson and Kittay 2009). The
philosophers who make such comparisons emphasize contrasts like the
following: Vast numbers of chimpanzees and other “higher”
primates are used in painful and often lethal research for the benefit
of human beings. Although there are strong objections to specific
primate research programs and research on specific primates, there is
broad agreement that most primate research is acceptable if it has the
potential to contribute significantly to human health, and if the
harms and risks to the animal subjects are minimized. In contrast,
cognitively disabled human beings cannot be enrolled in potentially
harmful research unless they are likely to benefit, the risk of harm
is negligible, and their legal representatives consent to their
participation. They enjoy these protections even if they are no better
able than non-human primates to understand the aims of the research or
to consent to
 participation.[1]

The debate over the moral status of individuals with the most severe
cognitive disabilities also raises difficult methodological issues
concerning the reliance on intuitions, convictions, and considered
judgments in assessing moral arguments. Some philosophers would deny
that any argument should persuade us to abandon our conviction that it
would be terribly wrong to subject a human being cognitively incapable
of consent to painful and dangerous experimentation of no possible
benefit to him (e.g., Kittay 2008). Two philosophers have adapted G.E.
Moore’s “proof” of the existence of the external world (see
Entry on
 George Edward Moore)
 to claim that we are more confident of the truth of the proposition
that all human beings are morally equal, and morally superior to other
animals than of the validity of the arguments denying it (Curtis and
Vehmas, 2016a, 2016b). Other philosophers reject the application of
Moore’s argument to moral status (Lachlan, 2016; Roberts
forthcoming); more broadly, they insist that even firm convictions
about moral status cannot be immune from critical scrutiny, especially
if they appear to conflict with other deeply held convictions (McMahan
2007). Still others deny such convictions any presumptive weight or
authority (Singer 2005).

Finally, in addressing the moral status of cognitively disabled humans
in a separate entry, rather than in a general entry on disability, we
are not endorsing a controversial “exceptionalism” about
cognitive disabilities—a view that regards them as fundamentally
different from other kinds of impairment (see
 Related Entries below).
 Our reason for limiting ourselves to cognitive impairment is
dialectical: there is currently no debate about the moral status of
individuals with non-cognitive disabilities. We know of no serious
philosopher who argues that people who cannot see, hear, or use their
legs, or who experience frequent depression or hallucinations, have
lower moral status than people without such disabilities. Admittedly,
some philosophers claiming to regard humans with physical or
psychiatric disabilities as having the same moral status as
nondisabled humans also take positions that other philosophers see as
inconsistent with a commitment to equal moral status. One notable
example is Rawls’ (1971) exclusion of people with physical
disabilities from the Original Position on the assumption that they
are not fully cooperating members of society. Another example is the
defense of “quality adjustment” in allocating scarce
healthcare resources, which discounts the life-years of people with
disabilities to reflect their supposedly lower quality of life
(Williams 1987). But whether or not these positions are consistent
with the recognition of full moral status, their proponents insist
that they are; they do not attempt to argue against the equal moral
status of people with physical or (most) psychiatric disabilities. By
contrast, the moral status of human beings with cognitive disabilities
has become a subject of intense debate among philosophers, applied
ethicists, and disability scholars (for a recent discussion, see
Carlson and Kittay 2009).

We will proceed as follows. We will first characterize the human
beings who are the subject of the debate on moral status—those
with what we will call “radical cognitive disabilities.”
After discussing the ways in which humans are classified as
cognitively disabled, we will describe the narrower category of humans
whom the debate concerns. To be clear, this is a group of humans
stipulated to exist rather than classified by empirical procedures. We
will note the difficulty of separating claims about such stipulated
individuals from claims that some actual individuals satisfy that
stipulation. Next, we will characterize the concept of moral status,
describing its structure and function. We will then outline the
principal differences in how that concept is understood, particularly
its “inclusion criteria”—the criteria for ascribing
what we will call “full moral status,” the status
attributed to cognitively nondisabled adult human beings. (In calling
that moral status “full,” we do not intend to take sides
in the debates over whether there can be any higher moral status.) We
will identify one family of moral-status accounts—those basing
possession on individual attributes—as the primary, though not
the exclusive, source of the challenge addressed in this entry: the
claim that some human beings lack full moral status. After outlining
those accounts, we will review several ways of meeting the challenge:
1) basing full moral status on individual attributes shared by a
greater proportion of human beings; 2) adopting secondary grounds for
the possession of full moral status—by “courtesy” or
by “proxy”; 3) rejecting individual attribute accounts in
favor of accounts that base the full moral status of all human beings
on their species membership or their humanity.

Moral Cognitivism vs. Non-Cognitivism,0.5586944818496704,0.6702436208724976,"


Non-cognitivism is a variety of irrealism about ethics with a number
of influential variants. Non-cognitivists agree with error theorists
that there are no moral properties or moral facts. But rather than
thinking that this makes moral statements false, non-cognitivists claim
that moral statements are not in the business of predicating properties
or making statements which could be true or false in any substantial
sense. Roughly put, non-cognitivists think that moral statements have no
substantial truth conditions. Furthermore, according to non-cognitivists, when
people utter moral sentences they are not typically expressing states
of mind which are beliefs or which are cognitive in the way that
beliefs are. Rather they are expressing non-cognitive attitudes more
similar to desires, approval or disapproval.


Cognitivism is the denial of non-cognitivism. Thus it holds that
moral statements do express beliefs and that they are apt for truth and
falsity. But cognitivism need not be a species of realism since a
cognitivist can be an error theorist and think all moral statements
false. Still, moral realists are cognitivists insofar as they think
moral statements are apt for robust truth and falsity and that many of them
are in fact true.

Hermann Cohen, more than any other single figure, is responsible for
founding the orthodox neo-Kantianism that dominated academic
philosophy in Germany from the 1870s until the end of the First World
War.  Earlier German philosophers finding inspiration in Kant tended
either towards speculative, metaphysical idealism, or sought to
address philosophical questions with the resources of the empirical
sciences, especially psychology. In contrast, Cohen's seminal
interpretation of Kant offered a vision of philosophy that decisively
maintained its independence from empirical psychology, without at the
same time simply lapsing back into uncritical metaphysics. Cohen
brought these attitudes to bear on a wide range of topics, writing
systematically about epistemology, philosophy of science, ethics, law,
political theory, and aesthetics. His anti-psychologism became a
defining commitment not only of the Marburg School of neo-Kantianism,
founded by Cohen himself, but of orthodox neo-Kantianism more
generally. Indeed, that commitment ultimately defined the
philosophical context from which, in the early twentieth century, both
phenomenology and logical positivism emerged.


No less significant than his influence on academic philosophy, Cohen
was his generation's preeminent German-Jewish public intellectual and
religious philosopher. His philosophical ethics and political
theory provided the foundation for a non-Marxist, Kantian democratic
socialism that informed his more popular and topical writings. He
argued publicly for universal suffrage and for the rights of workers to
organize democratically-constituted collectives. He also saw deep
points of connection between ethics and religion, and developed a view
of Judaism as a profoundly ethical system of belief and practice.
He argued that monotheism was the historical source of the idea of
universal ethical laws, and thus that Judaism offered the world its
first model of a universalist morality. This view of Judaism's
ethical significance ultimately informed Cohen's public defense of the
Jews' place in Germany not only against anti-Semitic attacks, but also
against the arguments of early twentieth-century Zionists.
However, Cohen's influence on Jewish thought extends far beyond debates
within Imperial Germany: his late religious writings inspired a broad
renewal in twentieth-century Jewish ethics and philosophy of
religion.

Robin George Collingwood,0.6576588153839111,0.5348834991455078,"


R. G. Collingwood (1889–1943) was a British philosopher and
practising archaeologist best known for his work in aesthetics and the
philosophy of history. During the 1950s and 1960s his philosophy of
history in particular occupied centre stage in the debate concerning
the nature of explanation in the social sciences and whether or not
they are ultimately reducible to explanations in the natural sciences.
Primarily through the interpretative efforts of W. H. Dray,
Collingwood's work in the philosophy of history came to be seen as
providing a powerful antidote against Carl Hempel's claim for
methodological unity.


Collingwood is the author of one of the most important treatises in
meta-philosophy written in the first half of the twentieth century,
An Essay on Philosophical Method (1933), which is a sustained
attempt to explain why philosophy is an autonomous discipline with a
distinctive method and subject matter that differ from those of the
natural and the exact sciences.


He is often described as one of the British Idealists, although the
label fails to capture his distinctive kind of idealism, which is
conceptual rather than metaphysical. In his correspondence with Gilbert
Ryle, Collingwood himself explicitly rejected the label
“idealist” because he did not endorse the arch-rationalist
assumptions that shaped much British idealism at the end of the 19th
and the early part of the 20th century and consequently did not wish to
be identified with it.


From the mid-thirties onwards Collingwood's work increasingly
engaged in a dialogue with the newly emerging school of analytic
philosophy. In An Essay on Metaphysics (1940) he attacked the
neo-empiricist assumptions prevalent in early analytic philosophy and
advocated a logical/epistemological transformation of metaphysics from
a study of being or ontology to a study of the absolute presuppositions
or heuristic principles which govern different forms of enquiry.
Collingwood thus occupies a distinctive position in the history of
British philosophy in the first half of the 20th century. He rejects
equally the neo-empiricist assumptions that prevailed in early analytic
philosophy and the kind of metaphysics that the analytical school
sought to overthrow. His epistemological reform of metaphysics also
ensures a distinctive role and subject matter for philosophical enquiry
and is thus far from advocating a merely therapeutic conception of
philosophy or the dissolution of philosophical into linguistic analysis
in the manner of ordinary language philosophy.

  Collingwood's aesthetics.

Anthony Collins,0.5904152989387512,0.3746454119682312,"


Anthony Collins (1676–1729) was a wealthy English free-thinker,
deist and materialist who in his later years became a country squire
and local government official in Essex. Along with John Toland, Collins
was the most significant member of a close knit circle of radical free
thinkers that arose in England in the first three decades of the
eighteenth century. This group included such men as Samuel Bold,
Matthew Tindal, Thomas Woolston and William
 Wollaston.[1]
 He was a
friend of John Locke in Locke's old age and Locke was one important
formative influence on his philosophical views. In respect to his
materialism and determinism Collins was clearly influenced more by
Hobbes, Bayle and possibly Spinoza than he was by Locke. The
Latitudinarians may well have influenced his views about free-thinking
as well as Locke.  Collins' works had some influence in England and
much more on the continent during the 18th century.


Collins' central passion is the autonomy of reason particularly with
respect to religion. Collins was strongly motivated by an aversion to
religious persecution. Issues revolving around religious freedom are
the threads that run through all of his writing. It is possible to
divide Collins' works into those that are mainly philosophical and
those that are more narrowly religious, but they are clearly
connected.  His 1707–8 pamphlet controversy with Samuel Clarke over
whether “matter can think” and other topics, and his book
about free will and determinism are chiefly engaged with philosophical
topics. Even these topics, however, involve such religious issues as
the immortality of the soul and punishment and reward in the next
life. His writing about reason and free-thinking may be regarded as on
the borderline between philosophy and religion. Although it deals with
epistemological and sometimes metaphysical issues, it focuses almost
entirely on religious issues. His religious works are even more
narrowly focused. The Thirty nine Articles are the only official
confessional statement of Anglicanism. Two of Collins' books deal with
the authenticity of Article 20 of the Thirty nine Articles and whether
the church has the power to make doctrine. In large measure these
represent the doctrines of free-thinking applied to the particular
case of the Anglican Church.  Collins also wrote a book examining the
question of whether the prophecies of Christ's messiahship could be
accepted. This seems to be a rejection of Christianity as a revealed
religion. How far Collins went in the direction of atheism is still a
matter of scholarly debate.


Collins was clearly a controversial figure in his time; nor has
scholarly treatment down the years done much better at being objective.
As Ernest Campbell Mossner remarks: “The Deists were long subjected to
the odium theologicum and the historians of the movement have
almost without exception downgraded or slandered them both socially as
well as intellectually since the time of John Leland in the eighteenth
century.” (Mossner, 1967b, p. 335)

Colonialism,0.4389707446098328,0.641496479511261,"

Colonialism is a practice of domination, which involves the
subjugation of one people to another. One of the difficulties in
defining colonialism is that it is hard to distinguish it from
imperialism. Frequently the two concepts are treated as synonyms. Like
colonialism, imperialism also involves political and economic control
over a dependent territory. The etymology of the two terms, however,
provides some clues about how they differ. The term colony comes from
the Latin word colonus, meaning farmer. This root reminds us
that the practice of colonialism usually involved the transfer of
population to a new territory, where the arrivals lived as permanent
settlers while maintaining political allegiance to their country of
origin. Imperialism, on the other hand, comes from the Latin term
imperium, meaning to command. Thus, the term imperialism
draws attention to the way that one country exercises power over
another, whether through settlement, sovereignty, or indirect
mechanisms of control.

The legitimacy of colonialism has been a longstanding concern for
political and moral philosophers in the Western tradition. At least
since the Crusades and the conquest of the Americas, political
theorists have struggled with the difficulty of reconciling ideas
about justice and natural law with the practice of European
sovereignty over non-Western peoples. In the nineteenth century, the
tension between liberal thought and colonial practice became
particularly acute, as dominion of Europe over the rest of the world
reached its zenith. Ironically, in the same period when most political
philosophers began to defend the principles of universalism and
equality, the same individuals still defended the legitimacy of
colonialism and imperialism. One way of reconciling those apparently
opposed principles was the argument known as the “civilizing
mission,” which suggested that a temporary period of political
dependence or tutelage was necessary in order for
“uncivilized” societies to advance to the point where they
were capable of sustaining liberal institutions and
self-government.

The goal of this entry is to analyze the relationship between Western
political theory and the project of colonialism. After providing a
more thorough discussion of the concept of colonialism, this entry
will explain how European thinkers justified, legitimized, and
challenged political domination. The third section focuses on
liberalism and the fourth section briefly discusses the Marxist
tradition, including Marx’s own defense of British colonialism
in India and Lenin’s anti-imperialist writings. The fifth
section provides an introduction to contemporary “post-colonial
theory.” This approach has been particularly influential in
literary studies because it draws attention to the diverse ways that
postcolonial subjectivities are constituted and resisted through
discursive practices. The final section will introduce an Indigenous
critique of settler-colonialism that emerges both as a response to
colonial practices of domination and dispossession of land, customs
and traditional history and to post-colonial theories of universalism.
The goal of the entry is to provide an overview of the vast and
complex literature that explores the theoretical issues emerging out
of the experience of European colonization.

Color,0.7610239386558533,0.4153529703617096,"

Colors are of philosophical interest for a number of reasons. One of
the most important reasons is that color raises serious metaphysical
issues, concerning the nature both of physical reality and of the
mind. Among these issues are questions concerning whether color is
part of a mind-independent reality, and what account we can give of
experiences of color. These issues have been, and continue to be,
inextricably linked with important epistemological and semantic

The Common Good,0.456543892621994,0.6831195950508118,"

In ordinary political discourse, the “common good” refers
to those facilities—whether material, cultural or
institutional—that the members of a community provide to all
members in order to fulfill a relational obligation they all have to
care for certain interests that they have in common. Some canonical
examples of the common good in a modern liberal democracy include: the
road system; public parks; police protection and public safety; courts
and the judicial system; public schools; museums and cultural
institutions; public transportation; civil liberties, such as the
freedom of speech and the freedom of association; the system of
property; clean air and clean water; and national defense. The term
itself may refer either to the interests that members have in common
or to the facilities that serve common interests. For example, people
may say, “the new public library will serve the common
good” or “the public library is part of the common
good”.

As a philosophical concept, the common good is best understood as part
of an encompassing model for practical reasoning among the members of
a political community. The model takes for granted that citizens stand
in a “political” or “civic” relationship with
one another and that this relationship requires them to create and
maintain certain facilities on the grounds that these facilities serve
certain common interests. The relevant facilities and interests
together constitute the common good and serve as a shared standpoint
for political
 deliberation.[1]
 When citizens face various questions about legislation, public policy
or social responsibility, they resolve these questions by appeal to a
conception of the relevant facilities and the relevant interests. That
is, they argue about what facilities have a special claim on their
attention, how they should expand, contract or maintain existing
facilities, and what facilities they should design and build in the
future.

The common good is an important concept in political philosophy
because it plays a central role in philosophical reflection about the
public and private dimensions of social life. Let’s say that
“public life” in a political community consists of a
shared effort among members to maintain certain facilities for the
sake of common interests. “Private life” consists of each
member’s pursuit of a distinct set of personal projects. As
members of a political community, we are each involved in our
community’s public life and in our own private lives, and this
raises an array of questions about the nature and scope of each of
these enterprises. For example, when are we supposed to make decisions
based on the common good? Most of us would agree that we are required
to do so when we act as legislators or civil servants. But what about
as journalists, corporate executives or consumers? More fundamentally,
why should we care about the common good? What would be wrong with a
community whose members withdraw from public life and focus
exclusively on their own private lives? These are some of the
questions that motivate philosophical discussions of the common
good.

This article reviews the philosophical literature, covering various
points of agreement among traditional conceptions of the common good,
such as those favored by Plato, Aristotle, John Locke,
J.J. Rousseau, Adam Smith, G.W.F. Hegel, John Rawls and Michael Walzer. It also
covers some important disagreements, especially the disagreement
between “communal” and “distributive” views.
It concludes by considering three important topics in the literature:
democracy, communal sharing, and competitive markets. In order to
understand the issues, it is helpful to start by distinguishing the
common good from various notions of the good that play a prominent
role in welfare economics and welfare consequentialist accounts of
political morality.

Common Knowledge,0.7719468474388123,0.8869391083717346,"


A proposition A is mutual knowledge among a set of
agents if each agent knows that A. Mutual knowledge by itself
implies nothing about what, if any, knowledge anyone attributes to
anyone else. Suppose each student arrives for a class meeting knowing
that the instructor will be late. That the instructor will be late is
mutual knowledge, but each student might think only she knows the
instructor will be late. However, if one of the students says openly
“Peter told me he will be late again,” then each student knows that
each student knows that the instructor will be late, each student knows
that each student knows that each student knows that the instructor
will be late, and so on, ad infinitum. The announcement made
the mutually known fact common knowledge among the students. 



Common knowledge is a phenomenon which underwrites much of social
life. In order to communicate or otherwise coordinate their behavior
successfully, individuals typically require mutual or common
understandings or background knowledge. Indeed, if a particular
interaction results in “failure”, the usual explanation for this is
that the agents involved did not have the common knowledge that would
have resulted in success. If a married couple are separated in a
department store, they stand a good chance of finding one another
because their common knowledge of each others' tastes and experiences
leads them each to look for the other in a part of the store both know
that both would tend to frequent. Since the spouses both love
cappuccino, each expects the other to go to the coffee bar, and they
find one another. But in a less happy case, if a pedestrian causes a
minor traffic jam by crossing against a red light, she explains her
mistake as the result of her not noticing, and therefore not knowing,
the status of the traffic signal that all the motorists knew. The
spouses coordinate successfully given their common knowledge, while the
pedestrian and the motorists miscoordinate as the result of a breakdown
in common knowledge.


Given the importance of common knowledge in social interactions, it is
remarkable that only quite recently have philosophers and social
scientists attempted to analyze the concept. David Hume (1740) was
perhaps the first to make explicit reference to the role of mutual
knowledge in coordination. In his account of convention in A
Treatise of Human Nature, Hume argued that a necessary condition
for coordinated activity was that agents all know what behavior to
expect from one another. Without the requisite mutual knowledge, Hume
maintained, mutually beneficial social conventions would disappear.
Much later, J. E. Littlewood (1953) presented some examples of
common-knowledge-type reasoning, and Thomas Schelling (1960) and John
Harsanyi (1967–1968) argued that something like common knowledge is
needed to explain certain inferences people make about each other. The
philosopher Robert Nozick describes, but does not develop, the notion
in his doctoral dissertation (Nozick 1963), while the first
mathematical analysis and application of the notion of common
knowledge is found in the technical report by Friedell (1967), then
published as (Friedell
 1969).[1]
The first full-fledged philosophical
analysis of common knowledge was offered by David Lewis (1969) in the
monograph Convention. Stephen Schiffer (1972), Robert Aumann
(1976), and Gilbert Harman (1977) independently gave alternate
definitions of common knowledge. Jon Barwise (1988, 1989) gave a
precise formulation of Harman's intuitive account. Throughout the
1980's a number of epistemic logicians, both from philosophy and from
computer science, studied the logical structure of common knowledge,
and the interested reader should consult the relevant portions of the
two important monographs (Fagin et al. 1995) and (Meyer and Van der
Hoek 1995). Margaret Gilbert (1989) proposed a somewhat different
account of common knowledge which she argues is preferable to the
standard account. Others have developed accounts of mutual
knowledge, approximate common knowledge, and common
belief which require less stringent assumptions than the standard
account, and which serve as more plausible models of what agents know
in cases where strict common knowledge seems impossible (Brandenburger
and Dekel 1987, Stinchcombe 1988, Monderer and Samet 1989, Rubinstein
1992). The analysis and applications of common knowledge and related
multi-agent knowledge concepts has become a lively field of
research.


The purpose of this essay is to overview of some of the most
important results stemming from this contemporary research. The topics
reviewed in each section of this essay are as follows: Section 1 gives
motivating examples which illustrate a variety of ways in which the
actions of agents depend crucially upon their having, or lacking,
certain common knowledge. Section 2 discusses alternative analyses of
common knowledge. Section 3 reviews applications of multi-agent
knowledge concepts, particularly to game theory (von Neumann
and Morgenstern 1944), in which common knowledge assumptions have been
found to have great importance in justifying solution concepts
for mathematical games. Section 4 discusses skeptical doubts about the
attainability of common knowledge. Finally, Section 5 discusses the
common belief concept which result from weakening the
assumptions of Lewis' account of common knowledge.

Communitarianism,0.4479041695594788,0.6619928479194641,"


Modern-day communitarianism began in the upper reaches of
Anglo-American academia in the form of a critical reaction to John
Rawls' landmark 1971 book A Theory of Justice (Rawls 1971).
Drawing primarily upon the insights of Aristotle and Hegel, political
philosophers such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Michael Sandel, Charles
Taylor and Michael Walzer disputed Rawls' assumption that the
principal task of government is to secure and distribute fairly the
liberties and economic resources individuals need to lead freely
chosen lives. These critics of liberal theory never did identify
themselves with the communitarian movement (the communitarian label
was pinned on them by others, usually 
 critics),[1]
 much less offer a grand communitarian theory as a systematic
alternative to liberalism.  Nonetheless, certain core arguments meant
to contrast with liberalism's devaluation of community recur in the
works of the four theorists named above (Avineri & de-Shalit 1992,
Bell 1993, Berten et al. 1997, Mulhall & Swift 1996, and
Rasmussen 1990), and for purposes of clarity one can distinguish
between claims of three sorts: methodological claims about the
importance of tradition and social context for moral and political
reasoning, ontological or metaphysical claims about the social nature
of the self, and normative claims about the value of
 community.[2]


This essay is therefore divided in three parts, and for each part I
present the main communitarian claims, followed by an argument (in each
part) that philosophical concerns in the 1980s have largely given way
to the political concerns that motivated much of the communitarian
critique in the first place.

Comparative Philosophy: Chinese and Western,0.4573411345481873,0.4719118773937225,"


Comparative philosophy brings together philosophical traditions that
have developed in relative isolation from one another and that are
defined quite broadly along cultural and regional lines — Chinese
versus Western, for example. Several main issues about the
commensurability of philosophical traditions make up the subject matter
of comparative philosophy. One issue is methodological commensurability
-- whether and how comparisons between different philosophical
traditions, in this case the Chinese and Western, are to be conducted.
Views run the gamut from those holding that meaningful comparisons
cannot be conducted at all to those holding that the content of
traditions must largely be the same. Other issues concerning
commensurability concern specific subject matters of traditions. The
issue of metaphysical and epistemological commensurability involves the
comparison of traditions on their conceptions of the real and their
modes of inquiry and justification. Ethical commensurability involves
the comparison of these traditions on the matters of how people ought
to live their lives, whether both traditions have moralities and if so
how similar and dissimilar they are. The separation between these main
issues is somewhat artificial, given that a discussion of
methodological commensurability will inevitably involve the comparison
of traditions on metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical matters.
There is some heuristic value, however, in beginning with a general
discussion of views on methodological commensurability with a brief
illustration of how these views might be applied to some
Chinese/Western comparisons. Subsequent sections will address
Chinese-Western comparisons in metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics
that have assumed special prominence in the literature. 



Doing comparative philosophy well can be very difficult because of
the vast range of texts and their intellectual and historical contexts
it requires its practioners to cover. Oversimplifications, excessively
stark contrasts, and illicit assimilations count as the most frequent
sins. One benefit of comparative philosophy lies in the way that it
forces reflection on the most deeply entrenched and otherwise
unquestioned agendas and assumptions of one's own tradition. Another
benefit at which its practioners often aim is that the traditions
actually interact and enrich one another. Demands for rigor and depth
of scholarship obviously rank as some of the most important standards
applying to philosophy inquiry. The task of meeting these standards
becomes more manageable as the field of inquiry narrows. Such a result
can be legitimate but sometimes myopic and impoverishing.

Decision-Making Capacity,0.5071550011634827,0.8949123024940491,"


In many Western jurisdictions, the law presumes that adult persons,
and sometimes children that meet certain criteria, are capable of
making their own health care decisions; for example, consenting to a
particular medical treatment, or consenting to participate in a
research trial. But what exactly does it mean to say that a subject has
or lacks the requisite capacity to decide? This last question has to do
with what is commonly called “decisional capacity,” a
central concept in health care law and ethics, and increasingly an
independent topic of philosophical inquiry.


Decisional capacity can be defined as the ability of health
care subjects to make their own health care decisions. Questions of
‘capacity’ sometimes extend to other contexts, such as
capacity to stand trial in a court of law, and the ability to make
decisions that relate to personal care and finances. However, for the
purposes of this discussion, the notion of decisional capacity will be
limited to health care contexts only; most notably, those where
decisions to consent to or refuse treatment are concerned.


The combined theoretical and practical nature of decisional capacity
in the area of consent is probably one of the things that makes it so
intellectually compelling to philosophers who write about it. But this
is still largely uncultivated philosophical territory. One reason is
the highly interdisciplinary and rapidly changing nature of the field.
Clinical methods and tests to assess capacity are proliferating. The
law is also increasingly being called upon to respond to these clinical
developments. All of this makes for a very eclectic and challenging
field of inquiry. Philosophers must tread carefully if their
contributions are to be timely and relevant.

A mathematical problem is computable if it can be solved in
principle by a computing device. Some common synonyms for
“computable” are “solvable”,
“decidable”, and “recursive”. Hilbert believed
that all mathematical problems were solvable, but in the 1930’s
Gödel, Turing, and Church showed that this is not the case. There
is an extensive study and classification of which mathematical
problems are computable and which are not. In addition, there is an
extensive classification of computable problems into computational
complexity classes according to how much computation—as a
function of the size of the problem instance—is needed to
answer that instance. It is striking how clearly, elegantly, and
precisely these classifications have been drawn.

Computational Complexity Theory,0.8838514089584351,0.8702054023742676,"
Computational complexity theory is a subfield of theoretical computer science one of whose primary goals is to classify and compare the practical difficulty of solving problems about finite combinatorial objects – e.g. given two natural numbers \(n\) and \(m\), are they relatively prime? Given a propositional formula \(\phi\), does it have a satisfying assignment? If we were to play chess on a board of size \(n \times n\), does white have a winning strategy from a given initial position? These problems are equally difficult from the standpoint of classical  computability theory in the sense that they are all effectively decidable. Yet they still appear to differ significantly in practical difficulty. For having been supplied with a pair of numbers \(m \gt n \gt 0\), it is possible to determine their relative primality by a method (Euclid’s algorithm) which requires a number of steps proportional to \(\log(n)\). On the other hand, all known methods for solving the latter two problems require a ‘brute force’ search through a large class of cases which increase at least exponentially in the size of the problem instance.
Complexity theory attempts to make such distinctions precise by proposing a formal criterion for what it means for a mathematical problem to be feasibly decidable – i.e. that it can be solved by a conventional Turing machine in a number of steps which is proportional to a polynomial function of the size of its input. The class of problems with this property is known as \(\textbf{P}\) – or polynomial time – and includes the first of the three problems described above. \(\textbf{P}\) can be formally shown to be distinct from certain other classes such as \(\textbf{EXP}\) – or exponential time – which includes the third problem from above. The second problem from above belongs to a complexity class known as \(\textbf{NP}\) – or non-deterministic polynomial time – consisting of those problems which can be correctly decided by some computation of a non-deterministic Turing machine in a number of steps which is a polynomial function of the size of its input. A famous conjecture – often regarded as the most fundamental in all of theoretical computer science – states that \(\textbf{P}\) is also properly contained in \(\textbf{NP}\) – i.e. \(\textbf{P} \subsetneq \textbf{NP}\).
Demonstrating the non-coincidence of these and other complexity classes remain important open problems in complexity theory. But even in its present state of development, this subject connects many topics in logic, mathematics, and surrounding fields in a manner which bears on the nature and scope of our knowledge of these subjects. Reflection on the foundations of complexity theory is thus of potential significance not only to the philosophy of computer science, but also to philosophy of mathematics and epistemology as well.

of clouds where it seemed like there was one. And what holds for clouds
holds for anything whose boundaries look less clear the closer you look
at it. And that includes just about every kind of object we normally
think about, including humans. Although this seems to be a merely
technical puzzle, even a triviality, a surprising range of proposed
solutions has emerged, many of them mutually inconsistent. It is not
even settled whether a solution should come from metaphysics, or from
philosophy of language, or from logic. Here we survey the options, and
provide several links to the many topics related to the Problem.

Compositionality,0.7868660688400269,0.6898435354232788,"

Anything that deserves to be called a language must contain meaningful
expressions built up from other meaningful expressions. How are their
complexity and meaning related? The traditional view is that the
relationship is fairly tight: the meaning of a complex expression is
fully determined by its structure and the meanings of its
constituents—once we fix what the parts mean and how they are
put together we have no more leeway regarding the meaning of the
whole. This is the principle of compositionality, a fundamental
presupposition of most contemporary work in semantics.

Proponents of compositionality typically emphasize the productivity
and systematicity of our linguistic understanding. We can understand a
large—perhaps infinitely large—collection of complex
expressions the first time we encounter them, and if we understand
some complex expressions we tend to understand others that can be
obtained by recombining their constituents. Compositionality is
supposed to feature in the best explanation of these phenomena.
Opponents of compositionality typically point to cases when meanings
of larger expressions seem to depend on the intentions of the speaker,
on the linguistic environment, or on the setting in which the
utterance takes place without their parts displaying a similar
dependence. They try to respond to the arguments from productivity and
systematicity by insisting that the phenomena are limited, and by
suggesting alternative explanations.

Computation in Physical Systems,0.8352567553520203,0.4445525109767914,"


In our ordinary discourse, we distinguish between physical systems
that perform computations, such as computers and calculators, and
physical systems that don't, such as rocks. Among computing
devices, we distinguish between more and less powerful ones. These
distinctions affect our behavior: if a device is computationally more
powerful than another, we pay more money for it. What grounds these
distinctions? What is the principled difference, if there is one,
between a rock and a calculator, or between a calculator and a
computer? Answering these questions is more difficult than it may
seem.


In addition to our ordinary discourse, computation is central to
many sciences. Computer scientists design, build, and program
computers. But again, what counts as a computer? If a salesperson sold
you an ordinary rock as a computer, you should probably get your money
back. Again, what does the rock lack that a genuine computer has?


How powerful a computer can you build? Can you build a machine that
computes anything you wish? Although it is often said that modern
computers can compute anything (i.e., any function of natural numbers,
or equivalently, any function of strings of letters from a finite
alphabet), this is incorrect. Ordinary computers can compute only a
tiny subset of all functions. Is it physically possible to do better?
Which functions are physically computable? These questions are bound
up with the foundations of physics.


Computation is also central to psychology and neuroscience, and
perhaps other areas of biology. According to the computational theory
of cognition, cognition is a kind of computation: the behavior of
cognitive systems is causally explained by the computations they
perform. In order to test a computational theory of something, we need
to know what counts as a computation in a physical system. Once again,
the nature of computation lies at the foundation of empirical
science.

“Human knowledge is expressed in language. So computational
linguistics is very important.”

–Mark Steedman, ACL Presidential Address (2007)



Computational linguistics is the scientific and engineering
discipline concerned with understanding written and spoken language
from a computational perspective, and building artifacts that usefully
process and produce language, either in bulk or in a dialogue setting.
To the extent that language is a mirror of mind, a computational
understanding of language also provides insight into thinking and
intelligence. And since language is our most natural and most versatile
means of communication, linguistically competent computers would
greatly facilitate our interaction with machines and software of all
sorts, and put at our fingertips, in ways that truly meet our needs,
the vast textual and other resources of the internet.

The following article outlines the goals and methods of
computational linguistics (in historical perspective), and then delves
in some detail into the essential concepts of  linguistic
structure and analysis (section 2),  interpretation (sections
3–5), and language use (sections 6–7), as well as acquisition of
knowledge for language (section 8), statistical and machine learning
techniques in natural language processing (section 9), and
miscellaneous applications (section 10).

[Editor's Note: The following new entry by Michael Rescorla replaces the

Could a machine think? Could the mind itself be a thinking machine?
The computer revolution transformed discussion of these questions,
offering our best prospects yet for machines that emulate reasoning,
decision-making, problem solving, perception, linguistic
comprehension, and other characteristic mental processes. Advances in
computing raise the prospect that the mind itself is a computational
system—a position known as the computational theory of
mind (CTM). Computationalists are researchers who
endorse CTM, at least as applied to certain important mental
processes. CTM played a central role within cognitive science during
the 1960s and 1970s. For many years, it enjoyed orthodox status. More
recently, it has come under pressure from various rival paradigms. A
key task facing computationalists is to explain what one means when
one says that the mind “computes”. A second task is to
argue that the mind “computes” in the relevant sense. A
third task is to elucidate how computational description relates to
other common types of description, especially neurophysiological
description (which cites neurophysiological properties of the
organism’s brain or body) and intentional description
(which cites representational properties of mental states).

Computer and Information Ethics,0.5539227128028871,0.8686272501945496,"


In most countries of the world, the “information
revolution” has altered many aspects of life significantly:
commerce, employment, medicine, security, transportation,
entertainment, and on and on. Consequently, information and
communication technology (ICT) has affected – in both good ways
and bad ways – community life, family life, human relationships,
education, careers, freedom, and democracy (to name just a few
examples). “Computer and information ethics”, in the
present essay, is understood as that branch of applied ethics which
studies and analyzes such social and ethical impacts of ICT.


The more specific term “computer ethics” has been used, in
the past, in several different ways. For example, it has been used to
refer to applications of traditional Western ethics theories like
utilitarianism, Kantianism, or virtue ethics, to ethical cases that
significantly involve computers and computer networks. “Computer
ethics” also has been used to refer to a kind of professional
ethics in which computer professionals apply codes of ethics and
standards of good practice within their profession. In addition, names
such as “cyberethics” and “Internet ethics”
have been used to refer to computer ethics issues associated with the
Internet.


During the past several decades, the robust and rapidly growing field
of computer and information ethics has generated university
courses, research professorships, research centers, conferences,
workshops, professional organizations, curriculum materials, books and
journals.

The Philosophy of Computer Science,0.7503147125244141,0.6255164742469788,"

The philosophy of computer science is concerned with those
ontological, methodological, and ethical issues that arise from within
the academic discipline of computer science as well as from the
practice of software development. Thus, the philosophy of computer
science shares the same philosophical goals as the philosophy of
mathematics and the many subfields of the philosophy of science, such
as the philosophy of biology or the philosophy of the social sciences.
The philosophy of computer science also considers the analysis of
computational artifacts, that is, human-made
computing systems, and it focuses on methods involved in the design,
specification, programming, verification, implementation, and testing
of those systems. The abstract nature of computer programs and the
resulting complexity of implemented artifacts, coupled with the
technological ambitions of computer science, ensures that many of the
conceptual questions of the philosophy of computer science have
analogues in the
 philosophy of mathematics,
 the philosophy of empirical sciences, and the
 philosophy of technology.
 Other issues characterize the philosophy of computer science only. We
shall concentrate on three tightly related groups of topics that form
the spine of the subject. First we discuss topics related to the
ontological analysis of computational artifacts, in Sections 1–5
below. Second, we discuss topics involved in the methodology and
epistemology of software development, in Sections 6–9 below.
Third, we discuss ethical issues arising from computer science
practice, in Section 10 below. Applications of computer science are

Historically, computers were human clerks who calculated in accordance
with effective methods. These human computers did the sorts of
calculation nowadays carried out by electronic computers, and many
thousands of them were employed in commerce, government, and research
establishments. The term computing machine, used increasingly
from the 1920s, refers to any machine that does the work of a human
computer, i.e., any machine that calculates in accordance with
effective methods. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, with the
advent of electronic computing machines, the phrase ‘computing
machine’ gradually gave way simply to ‘computer’,
initially usually with the prefix ‘electronic’ or
‘digital’. This entry surveys the history of these
machines.

Computing and Moral Responsibility,0.5503636598587036,0.8612871170043945,"


Traditionally philosophical discussions on moral responsibility have
focused on the human components in moral action. Accounts of how to
ascribe moral responsibility usually describe human agents performing
actions that have well-defined, direct consequences. In today’s
increasingly technological society, however, human activity cannot be
properly understood without making reference to technological
artifacts, which complicates the ascription of moral responsibility
(Jonas 1984; Waelbers
  2009).[1]
As we interact with and through these artifacts, they affect the
decisions that we make and how we make them (Latour 1992). They
persuade, facilitate and enable particular human cognitive processes,
actions or attitudes, while constraining, discouraging and inhibiting
others. For instance, internet search engines prioritize and present
information in a particular order, thereby influencing what internet
users get to see. As Verbeek points out, such technological artifacts
are “active mediators” that “actively co-shape
people’s being in the world: their perception and actions,
experience and existence” (2006, p. 364). As active mediators,
they change the character of human action and as a result it challenges
conventional notions of moral responsibility
(Jonas 1984; Johnson 2001).


Computing presents a particular case for understanding the role of
technology in moral responsibility. As these technologies become a
more integral part of daily activities, automate more decision-making
processes and continue to transform the way people communicate and
relate to each other, they further complicate the already problematic
tasks of attributing moral responsibility. The growing pervasiveness
of computer technologies in everyday life, the growing complexities of
these technologies and the new possibilities that they provide raise
new kinds of questions: who is responsible for the information
published on the Internet? Who is responsible when a self-driving
vehicle causes an accident? Who is accountable when electronic records
are lost or when they contain errors? To what extent and for what
period of time are developers of computer technologies accountable for
untoward consequences of their products? And as computer technologies
become more complex and behave increasingly autonomous can or should
humans still be held responsible for the behavior of these
technologies?


This entry will first look at the challenges that computing poses to
conventional notions of moral responsibility. The discussion will then
review two different ways in which various authors have addressed these
challenges: 1) by reconsidering the idea of moral agency and 2) by
rethinking the concept of moral responsibility itself.

Auguste Comte,0.6403734087944031,0.7496625185012817,"

Auguste Comte (1798–1857) is the founder of positivism, a
philosophical and political movement which enjoyed a very wide
diffusion in the second half of the nineteenth century.  It sank into
an almost complete oblivion during the twentieth, when it was eclipsed
by neopositivism. However, Comte’s decision to develop successively a
philosophy of mathematics, a philosophy of physics, a philosophy of
chemistry and a philosophy of biology, makes him the first philosopher
of science in the modern sense, and his constant attention to the
social dimension of science resonates in many respects with current
points of view. His political philosophy, on the other hand, is even
less known, because it differs substantially from the classical
political philosophy we have inherited.

Comte’s most important works are (1) the Course on Positive
Philosophy (1830–1842, six volumes, translated and condensed by
Harriet Martineau as The Positive Philosophy of Auguste
Comte); (2) the System of Positive Polity, or Treatise on
Sociology, Instituting the Religion of Humanity, (1851–1854, four
volumes); and (3) the Early Writings (1820–1829), where one
can see the influence of Saint-Simon, for whom Comte served as
secretary from 1817 to 1824. The Early Writings are still the
best introduction to Comte’s thought. In the Course, Comte
said, science was transformed into philosophy; in the 
System, philosophy was transformed into religion. The second
transformation met with strong opposition; as a result, it has become
customary to distinguish, with Mill, between a “good
Comte” (the author of the Course) and a “bad
Comte” (the author of the System). Today’s common
conception of positivism corresponds mainly to what can be found in
the Course.

Concepts are the constituents of thoughts. Consequently, they are crucial
to such psychological processes as categorization, inference, memory,
learning, and decision-making.  This much is relatively
uncontroversial.  But the nature of concepts—the kind of things
concepts are—and the constraints that govern a theory of
concepts have been the subject of much debate.  This is due, at least
in part, to the fact that disputes about concepts often reflect deeply
opposing approaches to the study of the mind, to language, and even to
philosophy itself.  In this entry, we provide an overview of theories
of concepts, and outline some of the disputes that have shaped debates
surrounding the nature of concepts.  The entry is organized around
five significant issues that are focal points for many theories of
concepts. Not every theory of concepts takes a stand on each of the
five, but viewed collectively these issues show why the theory of
concepts has been such a rich and lively topic in recent years. The
five issues are: (1) the ontology of concepts, (2) the structure of
concepts, (3) empiricism and nativism about concepts, (4) concepts and
natural language, and (5) concepts and conceptual analysis.

Étienne Bonnot, Abbé de Condillac, was the chief
exponent of a radically empiricist account of the workings of the mind
that has since come to be referred to as “sensationism.”
Whereas John Locke’s empiricism followed upon a rejection of
innate principles and innate ideas, Condillac went further and
rejected innate abilities as well. On his version of empiricism,
experience not only provides us with “ideas” or the raw
materials for knowledge, it also teaches us how to focus attention,
remember, imagine, abstract, judge, and reason. It forms our desires
and teaches us what to will. Moreover, it provides us with the best
lessons in the performance of these operations, so that a study of how
we originally learn to perform them also tells us how those operations
ought to be performed. The pursuit of this tenet led Condillac to
articulate an early developmental psychology, with explicit
pedagogical and methodological implications. His concerns also led him
to focus on the theory of perception, and to advance important and
original views on our perception of spatial form. He offered a more
searching, careful, and precise account of what exactly is given to us
by each of the sense organs than any that had been offered up to his
day, and presented a highly nuanced account of how this raw data is
worked up into our beliefs about the world around us.

Indicative Conditionals,0.7811642289161682,0.7867668867111206,"


Take a sentence in the indicative mood, suitable for making a
statement: “We'll be home by ten”, “Tom cooked the
dinner”. Attach a conditional clause to it, and you have a
sentence which makes a conditional statement: “We'll be home by
ten if the train is on time”, “If Mary didn't cook the
dinner, Tom cooked it”. A conditional sentence
“If A, C” or “C
if A” thus has two contained sentences or sentence-like
clauses. A is called the antecedent, C the
consequent. If you understand A and
C, and you have mastered the conditional construction (as we
all do at an early age), you understand “If A, C”.
What does “if” mean? Consulting the dictionary yields “on condition
that; provided that; supposing that”. These are adequate synonyms. But
we want more than synonyms. A theory of conditionals aims to give an
account of the conditional construction which explains when conditional
judgements are acceptable, which inferences involving conditionals are
good inferences, and why this linguistic construction is so important.

"The History of Feminism: Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet",0.589978039264679,0.6888400912284851,"

Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet (September
17, 1743–March 28, 1794) is most often referred to as one of the
last philosophes or as an early champion of social
 science.[1]
 An inspired proponent of human rights, Condorcet moved from his first
achievements in mathematics into public service, with the aim of
applying to social and political affairs a scientific model that he
termed a “social arithmetic”. Through educational and
constitutional reforms, he hoped to create a liberal, rational and
democratic polity. He advocated for the social utility of statistics
and probability theory, and he applied mathematical calculations to
fiscal crises, the reform of hospital care, jury decision-making and
voting procedures. He is best remembered as the author of the
posthumously published final work Esquisse d'un tableau historique
de l'esprit humain [Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Human
Mind] (1794), in which he diagnosed the stages of human progress,
including what was yet to come. However, far less well known is
Condorcet's extraordinary advocacy of the rights of
 women.[2]
 In this regard, he was exceptional even for an enlightened
 thinker.[3]

What Condorcet termed, in a 1790 essay by that name, “the
admission of women to the rights of citizenship” was widely
opposed on the grounds that women possessed distinctive natures, which
perfectly suited them to the fulfillment of their domestic
 duties.[4]
 Women were deemed unqualified for the realm of public affairs because
of their alleged greater susceptibility to sensations, flawed
rationality, and weaker sense of justice. Women did not get the vote
during the French Revolution, but they did benefit from many of the
changes that occurred in matters of marriage, divorce, inheritance,
and the legal status of unwed mothers and their children. However,
they ultimately suffered setbacks as many of these reforms were
withdrawn or curtailed during Napoleon's reign. (On the revolutionary
record, see Desan 2004; Traer 1980; Heuer 2005; Fraisse 1994); Landes
1988, 1996; Hufton 1999; Hunt 1992; Scott 1996; and Verjus 2002.) A
further consequence of the Revolution is that, for the first time, sex
was introduced as a constitutional condition for the possession of
political rights, even as rights were proclaimed to be universal and
inalienable. In contrast to such hypocrisy, Condorcet affirmed woman's
equal humanity on the grounds of reason and justice. While never
entirely dismissing the influential case for women's difference,
Condorcet refused to accept this as an impediment to their equal
enjoyment of civil and political rights. He attributed women's
limitations, to the extent they existed, not to their sex but rather
to their inferior education and circumstances. Appreciating the risks
he faced in rebutting one of the age's most deeply held prejudices, he
begged for the opportunity to engage in reasoned dialogue with his
opponents: 


I hope that anyone who attacks my arguments will do so without using
ridicule or declamation, and above all, that someone will show me a
natural difference between men and women on which the exclusion could
legitimately be based. (Condorcet 1790, in McLean and Hewitt 1994,
338–339)

Confirmation,0.7759336829185486,0.8170878887176514,"


Human cognition and behavior heavily relies on the notion that
evidence (data, premises) can affect the credibility of hypotheses
(theories, conclusions). This general idea seems to underlie sound and
effective inferential practices in all sorts of domains, from everyday
reasoning up to the frontiers of science. Yet it is also clear that,
even with extensive and truthful evidence available, drawing a mistaken
conclusion is more than a mere possibility. For painfully concrete
examples, one only has to consider missed medical diagnoses (see
Winters et al. 2012) or judicial errors (see Liebman et al. 2000). The
Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) is usually credited for
having disclosed the theoretical roots of these considerations in a
particularly transparent way (although, arguably, Hume’s line of
thought cuts deeper than this: see Howson 2000; also see Lange 2011
and Varzi 2008). In most cases of interest, Hume pointed out, many
alternative candidate hypotheses remain logically compatible with all
the relevant information at one’s disposal, so that none of the
former can be singled out by the latter with full certainty. Thus,
under usual circumstances, reasoning from evidence is necessarily
fallible.


This fundamental insight has been the source of a lasting
theoretical challenge: if amenable to analysis, the role of evidence as
supporting (or infirming) hypotheses has to be grasped by more nuanced
tools than plain logical entailment. As emphasized in a joke attributed
to American philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen (1880–1947), logic texts
had to be divided in two parts: in the first part, on deductive logic,
unwarranted forms of inference (deductive fallacies) are exposed; in
the second part, on inductive logic, they are endorsed (see Meehl 1990,
110). In contemporary philosophy, confirmation theory can be
roughly described as the area where efforts have been made to take up
the challenge of defining plausible models of non-deductive reasoning.
Its central technical term—confirmation—has
often been used more or less interchangeably with “evidential
support”, “inductive strength”, and the like. Here we
will generally comply with this liberal usage, although more subtle
conceptual and terminological distinctions could be usefully drawn.


Confirmation theory has proven a rather difficult endeavour. In
principle, it would aim at providing understanding and guidance for
tasks such as diagnosis, prediction, and learning in virtually any area
of inquiry. Yet popular accounts of confirmation have often been taken
to run into troubles even when faced with toy philosophical examples.
Be that as it may, there is at least one real-world kind of activity
which has remained a prevalent target and benchmark, i.e., scientific
reasoning, and especially key episodes from the history of modern and
contemporary natural science. The motivation for this is easily figured
out. Mature sciences seem to have been uniquely effective in relying on
observed evidence to establish extremely general, powerful and
sophisticated theories. Indeed, being capable of receiving genuine
support from empirical evidence is itself a very distinctive trait of
scientific hypotheses as compared to other kinds of statements. A
philosophical characterization of what science is would then seem to
require an understanding of the logic of confirmation. And so,
traditionally, confirmation theory has come to be a central concern of
philosophers of science.


In the following, major approaches to confirmation theory are
overviewed according to a classification that is relatively standard
(see Earman and Salmon 1992; Norton 2005): confirmation by instances
(Section 1), hypothetico-deductivism and its variants (Section 2),
and probabilistic (Bayesian) approaches (Section 3).

Unlike Buddhism which ultimately hailed from India, Confucianism was first and foremost a distinctly Chinese teaching. It spread, however, from Han dynasty China, into Korea, and then later entered Japan via, for the most part, the Korean peninsula. In significant respects, then, Confucianism is the intellectual force defining much of the East Asian identity of Japan, especially in relation to philosophical thought and practice. 



While there is a religious dimension to Confucianism, its teachings—ethical, epistemological, metaphysical, political, and aesthetic—are typically understood in relation to the socio-political world of humanity, beginning with the individual and his/her pursuit of moral and intellectual perfection, the family and its pursuit of harmony and order, and the polity and its pursuit of peace and prosperity throughout all below heaven, i.e., the world at large. In this respect, Confucianism was the secular philosophy operative in the ordinary world of everyday existence, at one level or another, throughout Japanese history, well into modern times. As often as not, however, its teachings became so integrated into Japanese culture without appeal to their overall identity as “Confucian” teachings, leading many, over time, to assume naively that they were integral to the Japanese mind and its myriad expressions in history and culture.



Viewed as a religio-philosophical teaching, Confucianism brims with high-minded ideals that have always challenged humanity to realize the highest state of ethical perfection and self-realization. However, as a political doctrine appropriated by the ruling elite to provide a modicum of legitimization for coercive rule, Confucianism was often voiced in cynical if not self-serving ways, belying the very ideals to which little more than lip-service was otherwise given. However, from the beginnings of political unity in Japan as provided by the nascent imperial system and then later by various shogunal regimes, Confucian thinking informed the ethics and socio-political ideals of the polity, and not infrequently imperial names and reign names, thus defining the parameters of real world discourse about the governed, those governing, and the nature and purpose of government. In modern times, ever resilient Confucian notions have provided conceptual foundations for integrating much of western thinking about self, society, the family, and the polity, thus helping to mediate Japan’s advance, philosophically, toward a more global understanding of civilization and modernity. 



Here, rather than trace the historical vicissitudes of Confucianism in Japanese culture, or explore the thinking of individual scholars, Confucianism will be approached as a systematic conceptual discourse defining the contours, philosophically, of much that was said and thought about the everyday world of common sense reality. In particular, the focus is on Confucian thinking about language, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, the mind, political theory, education, spirituality, and the environment. In this way, the foundations of Confucianism as intellectual discourse are hopefully laid bare.

[Editor's Note: The following new entry by Paul R. Goldin replaces the

 on this topic by the previous author.]


Xunzi 荀子 (third century BCE) was a Confucian
philosopher, sometimes reckoned as the third of the three great
classical Confucians (after Confucius and Mencius). For most of
imperial Chinese history, however, Xunzi was a bête
noire who was typically cited as an example of a Confucian who
went astray by rejecting Mencian convictions. Only in the last few
decades has Xunzi been widely recognized as one of China’s
greatest thinkers.

Sentence Connectives in Formal Logic,0.8800631761550903,0.7963490486145021,"


Natural language sentence-linking words (like “and”,
“or”) have traditionally had aspects of their use
simulated by corresponding connectives in various systems of formal
logic. (In fact we use the word “connective” more
generously, so that there don’t have to be two or more sentences
linked, allowing us to consider the analogues of words like
“not” and “necessarily” as connectives too.)
Amongst the questions this enterprise has raised are the
following. (1) Which such naturally occurring sentence connectives
call for a treatment of this kind?  (Which of them should be counted
as ‘logical constants’?)  (2) Do the aspects of their use
which are simulated in that process exhaust what we might think of as
their meanings, or is there typically some mismatch here? Of
course this second question depends on the particular formal treatment
given, since different logics may disagree on the formal principles
accorded to their representatives—for example in the case of
“if”, but according to one famous line of thought
(developed by H. P. Grice) when we focus specifically on their
treatment in classical propositional logic, any such apparent
discrepancies can be explained away by appeal to pragmatic principles
regulating ordinary cooperative conversation, and do not reflect
differences of meaning (semantic differences).


Neither question (1) nor question (2) will be addressed here.
Instead, this entry focusses on the properties of—and relations
between—the formal representatives of these connectives.
Examples of such properties include truth-functionality and a
replacement property called congruentiality, and of such relations what
we call the subconnective relation—relating one
connective to another when (roughly speaking)  every logical
principle holding for the first of a pair of connectives also holds for
the second. In fact, all of these concepts are subject to a further
relativity. For instance a connective is or is not congruential
according to a given logic, with a similar relativity in the
case of whether one connective is a subconnective of another. On the
other hand, as truth-functionality is defined below, a connective is
or is not truth-functional with respect to a class of
truth-value assignments—and various interesting further
relations give rise to a corresponding logic-relative version of this
concept depending on the different ways a class of truth-value
assignments is linked to a logic (which in turn depends on how we
think of a logic—as an ordinary consequence relation, for
example, or as a ‘multiple conclusion’ consequence
relation: see further note 1 below). For some other properties, the further relativity is a bit
different. For example, whether a given connective is uniquely
characterized—in the sense of being governed by rules which
when reduplicated to govern a new connective render compounds formed
from the same component sentences using the original and the new
connective completely interchangeable—is relative not just to a
logic but to a particular proof system (set of rules systematizing the
logic).


Section 1 introduces the idea of formal sentential languages as
(absolutely free) algebras, their primitive connectives having the
status of the fundamental operations of these algebras, and explains
the notion of a consequence relation on such a language. At a more
general level, Galois connections are also introduced, and a simple
observation made concerning what we call binary relational
connections, to be applied in later sections. Section 2 introduces the
fundamental idea of a valuation for a language (a bivalent truth-value
assignment to its formulas). Truth-functionality and a generalization
thereof called pseudo-truth-functionality (of a connective with
respect to a class of valuations) are explained, as well as the idea
of sequents and sequent-to-sequent rules. We then move to a more
general conception of sequents as originally conceived, allowing a set
of formulas to play the conclusion role rather than just a single
formula, as well as to the associated idea of generalized consequence
relations, emphasizing Carnap's motivation for making this
generalization. That motivation can be summarised with reference to
one connective. We take negation as our example. Consider the
consequence relation determined by the class of all valuations on
which the usual negation truth-function connective is associated with
the negation connective. This can be regarded as the classical logic
of negation, at least if logics are identified with consequence
relations. Now, there are additional valuations consistent with this
consequence relation on which the negation truth-function
is not associated with the negation connective. (The
terminology of a valuation's being consistent with a consequence
relation is adapted from Dana Scott.  A precise definition appears in
Section 2.) But when we consider instead generalized consequence
relations, the analogous discrepancy does not arise. Section 2
includes a statement of a result of D. Gabbay which isolates precisely
the truth-functions for which such discrepancies do not arise
(roughly: generalizations of the conjunction truth-function and
various pro jection functions), as well as of a result of
W. Rautenberg showing that despite this expressive weakness in the
apparatus of consequence relations, they are sufficiently
discriminating—without the need to pass to generalized
consequence relations—to distinguish the logical properties of
any two truth-functions (of the same arity).


Section 3 picks up the theme of sequent-to-sequent rules,
concentrating on semantic analysis in the style of J. W. Garson of
such rules, and also on the existence and uniqueness of connectives
satisfying given rules (a topic introduced by H. Hiż). These last
two are seen to be connected with what we call cut-inductivity and
id-inductivity of specifically sequent-calculus rules, via, in the
former case, a proposal identifying the existence of a connective
(with prescribed logical behaviour, given the perspective provided by
a logic not explicitly providing such a connective) with conservative
extension (of the given logic by rules for the new connective
detailing that behaviour). This proposal was made by N. D. Belnap;
some problems for conservative extension as a sufficient condition for
granting the existence or intelligibility of a new connective with
such-and-such logical properties are noted. Section 4 collects several
cases of interest in which one might wonder about the existence of
connectives with various such properties. For instance (this being
Example 3 out of a total of six) one might ask if it makes sense to
have a 1-ary connective with the property that two applications of
this connective are equivalent to a single application of (classical)
negation. Section 5 assembles notes and references.

Conscience,0.5052661895751953,0.6038071513175964,"

Through our individual conscience, we become aware of our deeply held
moral principles, we are motivated to act upon them, and we assess our
character, our behavior and ultimately our self against those
principles. Different philosophical, religious and common sense
approaches to conscience have emphasized different aspects of this
broad characterization. The resulting more specific understandings of
conscience will be presented in the sections below. On any of these
accounts, conscience is defined by its inward looking and subjective
character, in the following sense: conscience is always knowledge of
ourselves, or awareness of moral principles we have committed to, or
assessment of ourselves, or motivation to act that comes from within
us (as opposed to external impositions). This inward looking and
subjective character of conscience is also reflected in the
etymological relation between the notion of “conscience”
and that of consciousness. Only after the 17th
Century did “consciousness” start to be used with a
distinct meaning referring to the psychological and phenomenal
dimension of the mind, rather than to its moral dimension (for an
account of the terminological shift, see Jorgensen 2014).

The term “conscience” translates the Latin
“conscientia”, which refers to sharing
“knowledge” (scientia) “with”
(con-), and which in turns translates the equivalent Greek
term suneidenai (see Pierce 1955 and Sorabji 2014 for an
etymological analysis of the term). The literal meaning of the term
does not specify the type of knowledge involved and whom that
knowledge is shared with. However, the concept has traditionally been
used to refer to moral knowledge (we talk indifferently of
conscience and moral conscience) that is shared with oneself.
This reference to the self does not rule out that the source of the
morality in question be external to the self. For example, it might be
God, as in the Christian tradition, or the influence of one’s
culture or of one’s upbringing, as in the Freudian theory of the
Super-Ego. Reference to the self indicates that, from a psychological
point of view, conscience involves introspection, awareness of
one’s behavior, and self-assessment. As we shall see, although
these aspects often overlap, they are psychologically and conceptually
distinct functions.

“Sharing moral knowledge with oneself” might mean and
imply different things. As for the object of knowledge, for example,
it might refer to knowledge of one’s own conduct in view of an
assessment of it against a certain moral standard, or it might refer
to knowledge of moral standards or principles themselves. As for the
“self” with whom knowledge is shared, it might mean
sharing knowledge with a part of the self, as if we were split into
two persons (Sorabji 2014: 12), but it might also mean sharing
knowledge with an imaginary witness, such as an ideal observer (for
instance a god, an imagined moral model, an impartial spectator).
Unfortunately, debates in which appeals to conscience are often
made—for example the debate about conscientious objection in
health care—are often characterized by a lack of clarity as to
what it exactly is that we are talking about when we talk about
conscience, and therefore about what exactly people are claiming when
they put forward a “conscientious objection” to, for
example, abortion. In what sense does abortion violate the conscience
of a committed Catholic doctor? And is conscience amenable to reason and public
discussion, or are appeals to conscience ultimately based on
intuitions and private morality? In what sense is a conscientious
choice different from a mere moral preference? The notion of
conscience is in need of conceptual clarification.

This entry will expound the main features of the notion of conscience
as it is used in philosophical discussion, religious teaching and in
common language alike. The perspective adopted here will theoretical,
rather than historical. The entry focuses on the Western tradition and
some examples are drawn from Christian source. The entry is structured
around four possible, but not mutually exclusive, ways of
conceptualizing conscience. These will be preceded by an introductory
section outlining the pluralistic, morally neutral and subjective
nature of the concept of conscience.  The four main aspects of
conscience that will be described are the following. Section 2
discusses conscience as a faculty for self-knowledge and
self-assessment. Section 3 presents the epistemic aspect of conscience
that allows the formation of moral beliefs, distinguishing the
different possible sources of moral principles that inform such
beliefs. In section 4, conscience will be described as a motivational
force or as the source of our sense of duty, which already presupposes
a body of moral knowledge or of moral beliefs.  Finally, section 5
will focus on conscience understood as the body of personal core and
self-identifying moral beliefs which is often taken to be the basis of
moral integrity (Fuss 1964; Wicclair 2011) and of our sense of
personal identity (Childress 1979). As discussed in section 6, this
last approach to conscience is often used with a political function to
advocate freedom of thought and action in liberal democratic
societies, for example, as explained in subsection 6.1, through
conscientious objection to practices that one would otherwise be
professionally or legally expected to perform.

Medieval Theories of Conscience,0.5042593479156494,0.6027328372001648,"


Through conscience and its related notion, synderesis, human beings
discern what is right and wrong. While there are many medieval views
about the nature of conscience, most views regard human beings as
capable of knowing in general what ought to be done and applying this
knowledge through conscience to particular decisions about action. The
ability to act on the determinations of conscience is, moreover, tied
to the development of the moral virtues, which in turn refines the
functions of conscience.

Consciousness,0.728886067867279,0.4312662184238434,"


Perhaps no aspect of mind is more familiar or more puzzling than
consciousness and our conscious experience of self and world. The
problem of consciousness is arguably the central issue in current
theorizing about the mind. Despite the lack of any agreed upon theory
of consciousness, there is a widespread, if less than universal,
consensus that an adequate account of mind requires a clear
understanding of it and its place in nature. We need to understand both
what consciousness is and how it relates to other, nonconscious, aspects
of reality.

Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness,0.7353362441062927,0.4298986196517944,"

Higher-order theories of consciousness try to explain the distinctive
properties of consciousness in terms of some relation obtaining
between the conscious state in question and a higher-order
representation of some sort (either a higher-order perception of that
state, or a higher-order thought or belief about it). The most
challenging properties to explain are those involved in
phenomenal consciousness—the sort of state that has a
subjective dimension, that has ‘feel’, or that it
is like something to undergo. These properties will
form the focus of this article.

Consciousness and Intentionality,0.7318117022514343,0.439913809299469,"

To say you are in a state that is (phenomenally) conscious is to
say—on a certain understanding of these terms—that you
have an experience, or a state there is something
it’s like for you to be in. Feeling pain or dizziness,
appearances of color or shape, and episodic thought are some widely
accepted examples. Intentionality, on the other hand, has to do with
the directedness, aboutness, or reference of mental states—the
fact that, for example, you think of or about
something. Intentionality includes, and is sometimes seen as
equivalent to, what is called “mental representation”.

Consciousness and intentionality can seem to pervade much or all of
mental life—perhaps they somehow account for what it is to have
a mind; at any rate they seem to be important, broad aspects of it.
But achieving a general understanding of either is an enormous
challenge. Part of this lies in figuring out how they are related. Are
they independent? Is one (or each) to be understood in terms of the
other? How we address the issues to which these questions give rise
can have major implications for our views about mind, knowledge, and
value.

Sections (1) and (2) offer introductory accounts of what is meant by
“consciousness” and “intentionality”
respectively, highlighting relevant difficulties of interpretation.
Then influential perspectives that have emerged in phenomenological
(Section 3) and analytic (Section 4) philosophy are sketched so as to
facilitate recognition of some common, recurrent themes. These
concern, first: the question of whether either consciousness or
intentionality is “internal to the subject” or instead
essentially tied to environment—the theme of
detachability. The second concerns the issue of how (or
whether) to distinguish basic kinds of intentionality—e.g.,
intellectual and sensory; conceptual and non-conceptual—and
where to place consciousness with respect to such divisions: this is
the theme of basic forms. Third, there are questions
about how consciousness is related to self-consciousness—the
theme of reflexivity. Section (5) describes diverse
perspectives on the consciousness-intentionality relationship engaging
with the themes of detachability and basic forms. Here separatist
views that divorce consciousness from intentionality are contrasted
with various intentionalist views that bind them together: externalist
and non-externalist; reductive and non-reductive; restrictive and
inclusive; reflexivist and non-reflexivist. This section links to two
supplementary discussions: one summarizes recent ways of arguing for
intentionalism; the other considers how intentionalism figures in
classic phenomenological writings. Section (6) focuses on the
restrictive/inclusive contrast, and on issues regarding
“cognitive phenomenology”. Section (7) returns to the
reflexivist theme, and higher-order representationalist and
self-representationalist accounts of consciousness—linking to a
supplementary discussion of consciousness of self. Section (8)
considers how one’s view of the relationship of consciousness to
intentionality might figure in one’s understanding of its place
in the mind generally. Finally, Section (9) suggests some ways in
which the issues of previous sections impinge on four broad areas of
philosophical interest: the nature and boundaries of mind and self;
the place of consciousness and intentionality in explanation; forms of
knowledge and justification; and kinds and instances of value.

Representational Theories of Consciousness,0.7565884590148926,0.4213268458843231,"


The idea of representation has been central in discussions of
intentionality for many years. But only more recently has it begun
playing a wider role in the philosophy of mind, particularly in
theories of consciousness. Indeed, there are now multiple
representational theories of consciousness, corresponding to different
uses of the term “conscious,” each attempting to explain the
corresponding phenomenon in terms of representation. More cautiously,
each theory attempts to explain its target phenomenon in terms of
intentionality, and assumes that intentionality is
representation. 



An intentional state represents an object, real or unreal (say, I’ll
Have Another or Pegasus), and typically represents a whole state of
affairs, one which may or may not actually obtain (say, that I’ll Have
Another becomes America’s 12th Triple Crown winner in the
Belmont Stakes in June, 2012). Like public, social cases of
representation such as writing or mapmaking, intentional states such
as beliefs have truth-value; they entail or imply other beliefs; they
are (it seems) composed of concepts and depend for their truth on a
match between their internal structures and the way the world is; and
so it is natural to regard their aboutness as a matter of mental
referring or designation. Sellars (1956, 1967) and Fodor (1975) argue
that intentional states are states of a subject that have semantical
properties, and the existent-or-nonexistent states of affairs that are
their objects are just representational contents.


So much is familiar and not very controversial. But problems of
consciousness are generally felt to be less tractable than matters of
intentionality. The aim of a representationalist theory of
consciousness is to extend the treatment of intentionality to that of
consciousness, showing that if intentionality is well understood in
representational terms, then so can be the phenomena of consciousness
in the relevant sense.


The notions of consciousness most commonly addressed by philosophers
are the following: (1) Conscious awareness of one’s own mental
states, and “conscious states” in the particular sense of:
states whose subjects are aware of being in them. (2) Introspection
and one’s privileged access to the internal character of
one’s experience itself.  (3) Being in a sensory state that has
a distinctive qualitative or phenomenal property, such as the color
one experiences in having a visual experience, or the timbre of a
heard sound. (4) The matter of “what it is like” for the
subject to be in a particular mental state, especially what it is like
for that subject to experience a particular phenomenal property as in
(3). Block (1995) and others have used “phenomenal
consciousness” for sense (4), without distinguishing it from
sense (3). (A further terminological complication is that some
theorists, such as Dretske (1995) and Tye (1995), have used the
expression “what it is like” to mean the qualitative
property itself, rather than the present higher-order property of that
property.)


For each of the four foregoing notions of consciousness, some
philosophers have claimed that that type of consciousness is entirely
or largely explicable as a kind of representing. This article will
deal mainly with representational theories of consciousness in senses
(3) and (4). The leading representational approaches to (1) and (2)
are “higher-order representation” theories, which divide
into “inner sense” or “higher-order
perception” views and “higher-order thought”
accounts.  For discussion of those, see the entry on
 higher-order theories of consciousness.

In the seventeenth century, “consciousness” began to take
on a uniquely modern sense. This transition was sparked by new
theories of mind and ideas, and it connected with other important
issues of debate during the seventeenth century, including debates
over the transparency of the mental, animal consciousness, and innate
ideas.  Additionally, consciousness was tied closely to moral
identity, with both French and Latin lacking even a linguistic
distinction between consciousness and conscience (i.e., a moral
sensibility). This semantic shift marked a philosophical division
between the psychological or phenomenal aspects of thought and a moral
sensibility as well. The discussions on all of these topics were rich
and varied in the seventeenth century—the article below provides

In ordinary conscious experience, consciousness of time seems to be
ubiquitous. For example, we seem to be directly aware of change,
movement, and succession across brief temporal intervals. How is
this possible? Many different models of
temporal consciousness have been proposed. Some philosophers have
argued that consciousness is confined to a momentary interval and that
we are not in fact directly aware of change. Others have argued that
although consciousness itself is momentary, we are nevertheless
conscious of change. Still others have argued that consciousness
is itself extended in time. In this entry, the motivations and
merits of these and other positions will be expounded and assessed.

The Unity of Consciousness,0.7243718504905701,0.4312712252140045,"

Human consciousness usually displays a striking unity. When one
experiences a noise and, say, a pain, one is not conscious of the
noise and then, separately, of the pain. One is conscious of the noise
and pain together, as aspects of a single conscious experience. Since
at least the time of Immanuel Kant (1781/7), this phenomenon has been
called the unity of consciousness. More generally, it is
consciousness not of A and, separately, of B and,
separately, of C, but of
A-and-B-and-C together, as the contents of
a single conscious state.

Historically, the notion of the unity of consciousness has played a
very large role in thought about the mind. Indeed, as we will see, it
figured centrally in some of the most influential arguments about the
mind from the time of Descartes to the 20th century. In the
early part of the 20th century, the notion largely
disappeared for a time, but since the 1960s, analytic philosophers and
others have begun to pay attention to it again.

Political Obligation,0.4121313393115997,0.7385637760162354,"


To have a political obligation is to have a moral duty to obey the
laws of one's country or state. On that point there is almost complete
agreement among political philosophers. But how does one acquire such
an obligation, and how many people have really done what is necessary
to acquire it? Or is political obligation more a matter of
being than of doing — that is, of simply being
a member of the country or state in question? To those questions many
answers have been given, and none now commands widespread assent.
Indeed, a number of contemporary political philosophers deny that a
satisfactory theory of political obligation either has been or can be
devised. Others, however, continue to believe that there is a solution
to what is commonly called “the problem of political
obligation,” and they are presently engaged in lively debate not
only with the skeptics but also with one another on the question of
which theory, if any, provides the solution to the problem.


Whether political obligation is the central or fundamental problem of
political philosophy, as some have maintained (e.g., McPherson), may
well be doubted. There is no doubt, however, that the history of
political thought is replete with attempts to provide a satisfactory
account of political obligation, from the time of Socrates to the
present. These attempts have become increasingly sophisticated in
recent years, but they have brought us no closer to agreement on a
solution to the problem of political obligation than the efforts of,
say, Thomas Hobbes and John Locke in the seventeenth century. Nor have
these sophisticated attempts made it unnecessary to look back to
earlier efforts to resolve the problem. On the contrary, an
appreciation of the troublesome nature of political obligation seems
to require some attention to its place in the history of political
thought.


This essay begins, therefore, with a brief history of the problem of
political obligation. It then turns, in Part II, to the conceptual
questions raised by political obligation, such as what it means for an
obligation to be political. In Part III the focus is
on the skeptics, with particular attention to the self-proclaimed
philosophical anarchists, who deny that political obligations exist
yet do not want to abolish the state. Part IV surveys the leading
contenders among the various theories of political obligation now on
offer, and Part V concludes the essay with a brief consideration of recent
proposals for pluralistic or “multiple principle”
approaches.

Medieval Theories of Consequence,0.7045509815216064,0.14669838547706604,"

Latin medieval theories of consequence are systematic analyses by
Latin medieval
 authors[1]
 of the logical relations between
 sentences[2],
 in particular the notions of entailment and valid inference. When
does a sentence B follow from a sentence A? (For example, from
‘Every human is an animal’ one may infer ‘Some
animal is a human’.) What are the grounds for the relation of
entailment/consequence? Are there different kinds of consequences?
These and other questions were extensively debated by these
authors.

Theories of consequence explicitly acquired an autonomous status only
in the 14th century, when treatises specifically on the
concept of consequence began to appear; but some earlier
investigations also deserve the general title of ‘theories of
consequence’, in view of their scope, sophistication and
systematicity. Taken as a whole, medieval theories of consequence
represent the first sustained attempt at adopting a
sentential/propositional
 perspective[3]
 since the Stoics in Greek antiquity, and — unlike Stoic logic,

Consequentialism,0.5079284906387329,0.6779733300209045,"


Consequentialism, as its name suggests, is the view that normative
properties depend only on consequences. This general approach can be
applied at different levels to different normative properties of
different kinds of things, but the most prominent example is
consequentialism about the moral rightness of acts, which holds that
whether an act is morally right depends only on the consequences of
that act or of something related to that act, such as the motive behind
the act or a general rule requiring acts of the same kind.

Rule Consequentialism,0.5090213418006897,0.6833688020706177,"
The theory of morality we can call full rule-consequentialism
selects rules solely in terms of the goodness of their consequences
and then claims that these rules determine which kinds of acts are
morally wrong. George Berkeley was arguably the first
rule-consequentialist. He wrote, “In framing the general laws of
nature, it is granted we must be entirely guided by the public good of
mankind, but not in the ordinary moral actions of our lives. …
The rule is framed with respect to the good of mankind; but our
practice must be always shaped immediately by the rule.”
(Berkeley 1712: section 31) Writers often classified as
rule-consequentialists include Austin 1832; Harrod 1936; Toulmin 1950;
Urmson 1953; Harrison 1953; Mabbott 1953; M. Singer 1955, 1961; and

Conservatism,0.3922399878501892,0.6013915538787842,"
Conservatism and its modernising, anti-traditionalist rivals,
liberalism and socialism, are the dominant political philosophies and
ideologies of the post-Enlightenment era. Conservatives criticise
their rivals for making a utopian exaggeration of the power of
theoretical reason, and of human perfectibility. Conservative
prescriptions are based on what they regard as experience rather than
reason; for them, the ideal and the practical are inseparable.  Most
commentators regard conservatism as a modern political philosophy,
even though it exhibits the standpoint of paternalism or authority,
rather than freedom. As John Gray writes, while liberalism is the
dominant political theory of the modern age, conservatism, despite
appealing to tradition, is also a response to the challenges of
modernity. The roots of all three standpoints “may be traced
back to the crises of seventeenth-century England, but [they]
crystallised into definite traditions of thought and practice only
[after] the French Revolution” (Gray 1995: 78).
It is contested both what conservatism is, and what it could or
ought to be—both among the public and politicians, and among the
philosophers and political theorists that this article inevitably
focuses on. Popularly, “conservative” is often a generic
term for “right-wing viewpoint occupying the political spectrum
between liberalism and fascism”. Philosophical commentators
offer a more distinctive characterisation. Many treat it as a
standpoint that is sceptical of abstract reasoning in politics, and
that appeals instead to living tradition, allowing for the possibility
of limited political reform. On this view, conservatism is neither
dogmatic reaction, nor the right-wing radicalism of Margaret Thatcher
or contemporary American “neo-conservatives”. Other
commentators, however, contrast this “pragmatic
conservatism” with a universalist “rational
conservatism” that is not sceptical of reason, and that regards
a community with a hierarchy of authority as most conducive to human
well-being (Skorupski 2015).
Compared to liberalism and socialism, however, conservatism has
suffered philosophical neglect (Broad 1913: 396–7). Many deny
that it is an ideology, or even a political philosophy, regarding it
instead as a disposition that resists theoretical expression—a
“non-ideology” that attempts to avoid the errors of
ideologies (Graham 1986: 172; in contrast, Nisbet 1986). Is it an
ancient attitude, or one that developed only in response to
Enlightenment rationality and its political products, liberalism and
socialism? How is it related to contemporary
“neo-conservatism”? Is it a coherent position, or does it,
as many have argued, fail to distinguish what is worth conserving from
what is not? These are some of the questions commonly raised about
conservatism, and that are explored here.

Constitutionalism,0.4120234549045563,0.65403813123703,"

Constitutionalism is the idea, often associated with the political
theories of John Locke and the founders of the American republic, that
government can and should be legally limited in its powers, and that
its authority or legitimacy depends on its observing these
limitations. This idea brings with it a host of vexing questions of
interest not only to legal scholars, but to anyone keen to explore the
legal and philosophical foundations of the state. How can a government
be legally limited if law is the creation of government? Does this
mean that a government can be ‘self-limiting’? Is this
even possible? If not, then is there some way of avoiding this
implication? If meaningful limitation is indeed to be possible,
perhaps constitutional constraints must somehow be
‘entrenched’, that is, resistant to change or removal by
those whose powers are constrained? Perhaps they must not only be
entrenched, but enshrined in written rules. If so, how are these rules
to be interpreted? In terms of their original, public meaning or the
intentions of their authors, or in terms of the, possibly
ever-developing, values and principles they express? How, in the end,
one answers these questions depends crucially on how one conceives the
nature, identity and authority of constitutions. Must a constitution
establish a stable framework for the exercise of public power which is
in some way fixed by factors like original public meaning or
authorial intentions? Or can it be a living entity which
grows and develops in tandem with changing political values and
principles? These and other such questions are explored below.

Constructive empiricism is the version of scientific anti-realism
promulgated by Bas van Fraassen in his famous book The Scientific
Image (1980). Van Fraassen defines the view as follows:


Science aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and
acceptance of a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically
adequate. (1980, 12)


With his doctrine of constructive empiricism, van Fraassen is widely
credited with rehabilitating scientific anti-realism. There has been a
contentious debate within the philosophy of science community over
whether constructive empiricism is true or false. There is also some
unclarity regarding what van Fraassen’s arguments for the doctrine
actually are. In addition, there are controversies about what the
doctrine actually amounts to. While constructive empiricism has not
gained a wide number of adherents, it continues to be a highly
influential doctrine in philosophy of science.

Constructivism in Metaethics,0.5460551977157593,0.6297271251678467,"

Metaethical constructivism is the view that insofar as there are
normative truths, they are not fixed by normative facts that are
independent of what rational agents would agree to under some
specified conditions of choice. The appeal of this view lies in the
promise to explain how normative truths are objective and independent
of our actual judgments, while also binding and authoritative for
us.

Constructivism comes in several varieties, some of which claim a place
within metaethics while others claim no place within it at all. In
fact, constructivism is sometimes defended as a normative
theory about the justification of moral principles. Normative
constructivism is the view that the moral principles we ought to
accept are the ones that agents would agree to or endorse were they to
engage in a hypothetical or idealized process of rational
deliberation.

Metaethical constructivist theories aim to account for the nature of
normative truths and practical reasons. They bear a problematic
relation to traditional classifications of metaethical theories. In
particular, there are disagreements about how to situate
constructivism in the realism/antirealism debate. These disagreements
are rooted in further differences about the definition of metaethics,
the relation between normative and metaethical claims, and the
purported methods pertinent and specific to metaethical inquiry. The
question of how to classify metaethical constructivism will be
addressed in what follows by focusing on the distinctive questions
that constructivist theories have been designed to answer. Section 1
explains the origin and motivation of constructivism. Sections
2–4 examine the main varieties of metaethical constructivism.
Section 5 illustrates related constructivist views, some of which are
not proposed as metaethical accounts of all normative truths, but only
of moral truths. Sections 6 and 7 review several debates about the
problems, promise and prospects of metaethical constructivism.

Epistemic Contextualism,0.7339154481887817,0.7129341959953308,"

Epistemic contextualism (EC) is a recent and hotly debated position.
EC is roughly the view that what is expressed by a knowledge
attribution — a claim to the effect that S
‘knows’ that p — depends partly on
something in the context of ‘the attributor’, and hence
the view is often called ‘attributor contextualism’.
Because what such an utterance expresses is context-dependent, so too
is whether the knowledge attribution is true. The typical EC view
identifies the pivotal contextual features as the attributor’s
practical stake in the truth of p, or the prominence in the
attributor’s situation of skeptical doubts about knowledge. The
typical EC view has it that as the stakes rise or the skeptical doubts
become more serious, the contextual standard gets more demanding. It
requires S to be in a better position if the attributor's
claim, ‘S knows that p’, is to express a
truth. In contrast, ‘invariantists’ about knowledge hold
that such factors in the attributor’s context do not affect the
standards that must be met by a true ‘knowledge’
attribution.

In addition to marking an important departure from traditional
epistemological assumptions, EC is claimed to provide a novel
resolution to certain puzzles about knowledge—not least,
skeptical ones—as well as to best comport with our everyday
knowledge-attributing practices. What follows describes the leading
forms of EC, so understood, as well as the principal arguments for and
major objections to EC. Along the way, EC is situated with respect to
certain other views, both kindred and competing.

Continental Rationalism,0.6402369737625122,0.3410155177116394,"


The expression “continental rationalism” refers to a set
of views more or less shared by a number of philosophers active on the
European continent during the latter two thirds of the seventeenth
century and the beginning of the eighteenth. Rationalism is most often
characterized as an epistemological position. On this view, to be a
rationalist requires at least one of the following: (1) a privileging
of reason and intuition over sensation and experience, (2) regarding
all or most ideas as innate rather than adventitious, (3) an emphasis
on certain rather than merely probable knowledge as the goal of
enquiry. While all of the continental rationalists meet one or more of
these criteria, this is arguably the consequence of a deeper tie that
binds them together—that is, a metaphysical commitment to the
reality of substance, and, in particular, to substance as an
underlying principle of unity.

Continuity and Infinitesimals,0.9219321012496948,0.7115224599838257,"


The usual meaning of the word continuous is
“unbroken” or “uninterrupted”: thus a
continuous entity—a continuum—has no
“gaps.” We commonly suppose that space and time are
continuous, and certain philosophers have maintained that all natural
processes occur continuously: witness, for example, Leibniz's famous
apothegm natura non facit saltus—“nature makes no
jump.” In mathematics the word is used in the same general sense,
but has had to be furnished with increasingly precise definitions. So,
for instance, in the later 18th century continuity of a function was
taken to mean that infinitesimal changes in the value of the argument
induced infinitesimal changes in the value of the function. With the
abandonment of infinitesimals in the 19th century this definition came
to be replaced by one employing the more precise concept of
limit.


Traditionally, an infinitesimal quantity is one
which, while not necessarily coinciding with zero, is in some sense
smaller than any finite quantity. For engineers, an infinitesimal is a
quantity so small that its square and all higher powers can be
neglected. In the theory of limits the term “infinitesimal”
is sometimes applied to any sequence whose limit is zero. An
infinitesimal magnitude may be regarded as what remains after
a continuum has been subjected to an exhaustive analysis, in other
words, as a continuum “viewed in the small.” It is in this
sense that continuous curves have sometimes been held to be
“composed” of infinitesimal straight lines.


Infinitesimals have a long and colourful history. They make an early
appearance in the mathematics of the Greek atomist philosopher
Democritus (c. 450 B.C.E.), only to be banished by the mathematician
Eudoxus (c. 350 B.C.E.) in what was to become official
“Euclidean” mathematics. Taking the somewhat obscure form
of “indivisibles,” they reappear in the mathematics of the
late middle ages and later played an important role in the development
of the calculus. Their doubtful logical status led in the nineteenth
century to their abandonment and replacement by the limit concept. In
recent years, however, the concept of infinitesimal has been refounded
on a rigorous basis.

The Continuum Hypothesis,0.9326431751251221,0.7448158264160156,"
The continuum hypotheses (CH) is one of the most central open
problems in set theory, one that is important for both mathematical
and philosophical reasons. 
 The problem actually arose with the birth of set theory; indeed,
in many respects it stimulated the birth of set theory. In 1874 Cantor
had shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
natural numbers and the algebraic numbers. More surprisingly, he
showed that there is no one-to-one correspondence between the natural
numbers and the real numbers. Taking the existence of a one-to-one
correspondence as a criterion for when two sets have the same size
(something he certainly did by 1878), this result shows that there is
more than one level of infinity and thus gave birth to the higher
infinite in mathematics. Cantor immediately tried to determine whether
there were any infinite sets of real numbers that were
of intermediate size, that is, whether there was an infinite
set of real numbers that could not be put into one-to-one
correspondence with the natural numbers and could not be put into
one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers. The continuum
hypothesis (under one formulation) is simply the statement that
there is no such set of real numbers. It was through his attempt to
prove this hypothesis that led Cantor do develop set theory into a
sophisticated branch of 
mathematics.[1]
 Despite his efforts Cantor could not resolve CH. The problem
persisted and was considered so important by Hilbert that he placed it
first on his famous list of open problems to be faced by the
20th century. Hilbert also struggled to resolve CH,
again without success. Ultimately, this lack of progress was explained
by the combined results of Gödel and Cohen, which together showed
that CH cannot be resolved on the basis of the axioms that
mathematicians were employing; in modern terms, CH is independent of
ZFC. 
 This independence result was quickly followed by many others. The
independence techniques were so powerful that set theorists soon found
themselves preoccupied with the meta-theoretic enterprise of proving
that certain fundamental statements could not be proved or
refuted within ZFC. The question then arose as to whether there were
ways to settle the independent statements. The community of
mathematicians and philosophers of mathematics was largely divided on
this question. The pluralists (like Cohen) maintained that
the independence results effectively settled the question by showing
that it had no answer. On this view, one could adopt a
system in which, say CH was an axiom and one could adopt a system in
which ¬CH was an axiom and that was the end of the
matter—there was no question as to which of two incompatible
extensions was the “correct”
one. The non-pluralists (like Gödel) held that the
independence results merely indicated the paucity of our means for
circumscribing mathematical truth. On this view, what was needed were
new axioms, axioms that are both justified and sufficient for the
task. Gödel actually went further in proposing candidates for new
axioms—large cardinal axioms—and he conjectured that they
would settle CH. 
 Gödel's program for large cardinal axioms proved to be
remarkably successful. Over the course of the next 30 years it was
shown that large cardinal axioms settle many of the questions that
were shown to be independent during the era of independence. However,
CH was left untouched. The situation turned out to be rather ironic
since in the end it was shown (in a sense that can be made precise)
that although the standard large cardinal axioms effectively settle
all question of complexity strictly below that of CH, they cannot (by
results of Levy and Solovay and others) settle CH itself. Thus, in
choosing CH as a test case for his program, Gödel put his finger
precisely on the point where it fails. It is for this reason that CH
continues to play a central role in the search for new axioms. 
 In this entry we shall give an overview of the major approaches to
settling CH and we shall discuss some of the major foundational
frameworks which maintain that CH does not have an answer. The subject
is a large one and we have had to sacrifice full comprehensiveness in
two dimensions. First, we have not been able to discuss the major
philosophical issues that are lying in the background. For this the
reader is directed to the entry 
 “Large Cardinals and Determinacy”, 
which contains a general discussion of the
independence results, the nature of axioms, the nature of
justification, and the successes of large cardinal axioms in the realm
“below CH”. Second, we have not been able to discuss every
approach to CH that is in the literature. Instead we have restricted
ourselves to those approaches that appear most promising from a
philosophical point of view and where the mathematics has been
developed to a sufficiently advanced state. In the approaches we shall
discuss—forcing axioms, inner model theory, quasi-large
cardinals—the mathematics has been pressed to a very advanced
stage over the course of 40 years. And this has made our task somewhat
difficult. We have tried to keep the discussion as accessible as
possible and we have placed the more technical items in the
endnotes. But the reader should bear in mind that we are presenting a
bird's eye view and that for a higher resolution at any point
the reader should dip into the suggested readings that appear at the
end of each section.[2] 
 There are really two kinds of approaches to new
axioms—the local approach and the global
approach. On the local approach one seeks axioms that answer questions
concerning a specifiable fragment of the universe, such
as Vω+1 or Vω+2, where
CH lies. On the global approach one seeks axioms that attempt to
illuminate the entire structure of the universe of sets. The
global approach is clearly much more challenging. In this entry we
shall start with the local approach and toward the end we shall
briefly touch upon the global approach. 
 Here is an overview of the entry: Section 1 surveys the
independence results in cardinal arithmetic, covering both the case of
regular cardinals (where CH lies) and singular cardinals. Section 2
considers approaches to CH where one successively verifies a hierarchy
of approximations to CH, each of which is an “effective”
version of CH. This approach led to the remarkable discovery of Woodin
that it is possible (in the presence of large cardinals) to have an
effective failure of CH, thereby showing, that the effective failure
of CH is as intractable (with respect to large cardinal axioms) as CH
itself. Section 3 continues with the developments that stemmed from
this discovery. The centerpiece of the discussion is the discovery of
a “canonical” model in which CH fails. This formed the
basis of a network of results that was collectively presented by
Woodin as a case for the failure of CH. To present this case in the
most streamlined form we introduce the strong logic
Ω-logic. Section 4 takes up the competing foundational view that
there is no solution to CH. This view is sharpened in terms of
the generic multiverse conception of truth and that view is
then scrutinized. Section 5 continues the assessment of the case for
¬CH by investigating a parallel case for CH. In the remaining two
sections we turn to the global approach to new axioms and here we
shall be much briefer. Section 6 discusses the approach through inner
model theory. Section 7 discusses the approach through quasi-large
cardinal axioms.

Contractarianism,0.4045654833316803,0.7983186841011047,"

“Contractarianism” names both a political theory of the
legitimacy of political authority and a moral theory about the origin
or legitimate content of moral norms. The political theory of
authority claims that legitimate authority of government must derive
from the consent of the governed, where the form and content of this
consent derives from the idea of contract or mutual agreement. The
moral theory of contractarianism claims that moral norms derive their
normative force from the idea of contract or mutual agreement.
Contractarians are skeptical of the possibility of grounding morality
or political authority in either divine will or some perfectionist
ideal of the nature of humanity. Social contract theorists from the
history of political thought include Hobbes, Locke, Kant, and
Rousseau. The most important contemporary political social contract
theorist is John Rawls, who effectively resurrected social contract
theory in the second half of the 20th century, along with David
Gauthier, who is primarily a moral contractarian. There is no
necessity for a contractarian about political theory to be a
contractarian about moral theory, although most contemporary
contractarians are both. It has been more recently recognized that
there are two distinct strains of social contract thought, which now
typically go by the names contractarianism and
 contractualism.

Contractarianism, which stems from the Hobbesian line of social
contract thought, holds that persons are primarily self-interested,
and that a rational assessment of the best strategy for attaining the
maximization of their self-interest will lead them to act morally
(where the moral norms are determined by the maximization of joint
interest) and to consent to governmental authority. Contractarianism
argues that we each are motivated to accept morality “first
because we are vulnerable to the depredations of others, and second
because we can all benefit from cooperation with others”
(Narveson 1988, 148). Contractualism, which stems from the Kantian
line of social contract thought, holds that rationality requires that
we respect persons, which in turn requires that moral principles be
such that they can be justified to each person. Thus, individuals are
not taken to be motivated by self-interest but rather by a commitment
to publicly justify the standards of morality to which each will be
held. Where Gauthier, Narveson, or economist James Buchanan are the
paradigm Hobbesian contractarians, Rawls or Thomas Scanlon would be
the paradigm Kantian contractualists. The rest of this entry will
specifically pertain to the contractarian strain wherever the two
diverge.

Contract is a branch of private law. It thus concerns private
obligations that arise in respect of symmetrical relations among
natural and artificial persons rather than public obligations that
arise in respect of hierarchical relations between persons and the
state. Contract, at least in its orthodox expression, is distinctive
for concerning chosen, or voluntary, obligations—that is,
obligations constituted by the intentions of the contracting
parties. This entry describes doctrinal and theoretical accounts of
contract law with a special emphasis on the relationship between
contract law and two near-neighbors—tort law and fiduciary
law.
Section 1 briefly outlines the doctrinal structure of orthodox
contract law, with an emphasis on contract’s character as chosen
obligation. At the same time, contract law concerns obligations that
might also be associated with adjacent bodies of doctrine that
elaborate un-chosen obligations—in particular tort law and
fiduciary law—and the norms—concerning due care and
loyalty—that underlie these involuntary obligations.  Section 2
describes encroachments by these bodies of law into contract and the
doctrinal, economic, and moral ideas that each employs.  Section 3
asks whether contract might remain doctrinally and theoretically
separate from tort and fiduciary law and retain its distinctive
character as chosen, private obligation.

sense—to indicate the view that morality is based on contract or
agreement—or in a narrow sense—to refer to a particular

This essay takes ‘contractualism’ in the narrower sense.
We begin with a brief summary of Scanlon’s contractualism, and
then situate his view in relation both to other social contract
theories and to its main rival among impartial accounts of
morality—namely, utilitarianism. Our discussion is then
organised around a series of challenges to the contractualist
account.

This entry outlines the role of the law of non-contradiction (LNC) as
the foremost among the first (indemonstrable) principles of
Aristotelian philosophy and its heirs, and depicts the relation
between LNC and LEM (the law of excluded middle) in establishing the
nature of contradictory and contrary opposition. §1 presents the
classical treatment of LNC as an axiom in Aristotle's “First
Philosophy” and reviews the status of contradictory and contrary
opposition as schematized on the Square of Opposition. §2
explores in further detail the possible characterizations of LNC and
LEM, including the relevance of future contingent statements in which
LEM (but not LNC) is sometimes held to fail. §3 addresses the
mismatch between the logical status of contradictory negation as a
propositional operator and the diverse realizations of contradictory
negation within natural language. §4 deals with several
challenges to LNC within Western philosophy, including the paradoxes,
and the relation between systems with truth-value gaps (violating LEM)
and those with truth-value gluts (violating LNC).  In §5, the
tetralemma of Buddhist logic is discussed within the context of gaps
and gluts; it is suggested that apparent violations of LNC in this
tradition (and others) can be attributed to either differing
viewpoints of evaluation, as foreseen by Aristotle, or to intervening
modal and epistemic operators.  §6 focuses on the problem of
“borderline contradictions”: the range of acceptability
judgments for apparently contradictory sentences with vague predicates
as surveyed in empirical studies, and the theoretical implications of
these studies. Finally, §7 surveys the ways of contradiction and
its exploitation in literature and popular culture from Shakespeare to

Convention,0.7636972069740295,0.8919816017150879,"


The central philosophical task posed by conventions is to analyze what
they are and how they differ from mere regularities of action and
cognition. Subsidiary questions include: How do conventions arise? How
are they sustained? How do we select between alternative conventions?
Why should one conform to convention? What social good, if any, do
conventions serve? How does convention relate to such notions as rule,
norm, custom, practice, institution, and social contract? Apart from
its intrinsic interest, convention is important because philosophers
frequently invoke it when discussing other topics. A favorite
philosophical gambit is to argue that, perhaps despite appearances to
the contrary, some phenomenon ultimately results from convention.
Notable candidates include: property, government, justice, law,
morality, linguistic meaning, necessity, ontology, mathematics, and
logic.

Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy, was published
posthumously and anonymously in 1690. This propounds an ontology of
spirit, derived from the attributes of God, which she sets out in
opposition to More, Descartes, Hobbes and Spinoza. Her concept of the
monad, which is indebted to the Kabbalism, anticipates Leibniz.

This entry takes as its focal point the philosophical contributions of
Anna Julia Cooper with an emphasis on her scholarship and some
attention to her commitments as an educator and activist. Authoring
one of the earliest book-length analyses of the unique situation of
Black women in the United States, Cooper offers clearly articulated
insights about racialized sexism and sexualized racism without
ignoring the significance of class and labor, education and
intellectual development, and conceptions of democracy and
citizenship.[1]
  With an academic training deeply rooted in the history
of Western philosophy and the classics, Cooper’s philosophical
significance also lies in her foundational contributions to feminist
philosophy, standpoint theory, and epistemology, as well as critical
philosophy of race and African-American philosophy (including African
American political philosophy). The first two sections of this entry
situate Cooper by providing some context for her two best known
writings and then exploring the historical and contemporary reception
of Cooper’s philosophy. From here, the main topics covered include an
in-depth analysis of her scholarship with special attention given to A
Voice from the South By a Black Woman of the South, her dissertation
(L’attitude de la France à l’égard de
l’esclavage pendant la revolution), and other select essays
beyond these two texts. The entry  concludes with a biographical
sketch of Cooper in order to prioritize her scholarship and critically
engage her theories (rather than commencing by recounting her life

Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) was a mathematician and astronomer
who proposed that the sun was stationary in the center of the universe
and the earth revolved around it. Disturbed by the failure of
Ptolemy's geocentric model of the universe to follow Aristotle's
requirement for the uniform circular motion of all celestial bodies
and determined to eliminate Ptolemy's equant, an imaginary point
around which the bodies seemed to follow that requirement, Copernicus
decided that he could achieve his goal only through a heliocentric
model. He thereby created a concept of a universe in which the
distances of the planets from the sun bore a direct relationship to
the size of their orbits. At the time Copernicus's heliocentric idea
was very controversial; nevertheless, it was the start of a change in
the way the world was viewed, and Copernicus came to be seen as the
initiator of the Scientific Revolution.

Corruption,0.45922374725341797,0.7923452854156494,"


The causes and effects of corruption, and how to combat corruption,
are issues that are increasingly on the national and international
agendas of politicians and other policymakers. For example, the World
Bank has relatively recently come around to the view that economic
development is closely linked to corruption reduction (World Bank
1997) and there have been numerous anti-corruption initiatives in
multiple jurisdictions (Heidenheimer and Johnston 2002; Preston and
Sampford 2002). Moreover, the very recent Global Financial Crisis has
revealed financial corruption, and spurred regulators to consider
various anti-corruption measures by way of response. By contrast,
the concept of corruption has not received much
attention.[1]
Existing conceptual work on corruption consists in little more than
the presentation of brief definitions of corruption as a preliminary
to extended accounts of the causes and effects of corruption and the
ways to combat it.[2] Moreover, most of these definitions of
corruption are unsatisfactory in fairly obvious
ways.[3]

Cosmological Argument,0.7164182662963867,0.5543138980865479,"

The cosmological argument is less a particular argument than an
argument type. It uses a general pattern of argumentation
(logos) that makes an inference from particular alleged facts
about the universe (cosmos) to the existence of a unique
being, generally identified with or referred to as God. Among these
initial facts are that particular beings or events in the universe are
causally dependent or contingent, that the universe (as the totality
of contingent things) is contingent in that it could have been other
than it is, that the Big Conjunctive Contingent Fact possibly has an
explanation, or that the universe came into being. From these facts
philosophers infer deductively, inductively, or abductively by
inference to the best explanation that a first or sustaining cause, a
necessary being, an unmoved mover, or a personal being (God) exists
that caused and/or sustains the universe. The cosmological argument is
part of classical natural theology, whose goal is to provide evidence
for the claim that God exists.

On the one hand, the argument arises from human curiosity as to why
there is something rather than nothing or than something else. It
invokes a concern for some full, complete, ultimate, or best
explanation of what exists contingently. On the other hand, it raises
intrinsically important philosophical questions about contingency and
necessity, causation and explanation, part/whole relationships
(mereology), infinity, sets, the nature of time, and the nature and
origin of the universe. In what follows we will first sketch out a
very brief history of the argument, note the two basic types of
deductive cosmological arguments, and then provide a careful analysis
of examples of each: first, two arguments from contingency, one based
on a relatively strong version of the principle of sufficient reason
and one based on a weak version of that principle; and second, an
argument from the alleged fact that the universe had a beginning and
the impossibility of an infinite temporal regress of causes. In the
end we will consider an inductive version of the cosmological argument
and what it is to be a necessary being.

Cosmology and Theology,0.906165897846222,0.4133358001708984,"
As long as humans have been trying to make sense of the universe,
they have been proposing cosmological theories. Furthermore, the
notion of a deity often plays a central role in these cosmological
theories. According to most monotheistic religions, God is the sole
creator and sustainer of the universe.
But the last one hundred years have seen a different sort of
cosmology: a scientific cosmology. Without running afoul of the
demarcation problem, the notable characteristics of scientific
cosmology are that it uses the tools of mathematical physics (it is
formalizable) and that it makes precise and testable predictions. What
has this new scientific cosmology to do with traditional (often
theistic) cosmologies?  Has the new cosmology replaced the older
cosmologies? Does the new cosmology inform or interpret the older
cosmologies?
Our subsequent discussion will be restricted almost completely to
the case of western monotheism—Judaism, Christianity, and
Islam—and even more specifically to variants of
Christianity. Even so, we note a wide range of diversity among
Christian beliefs and Christian attitudes towards science in general,
and towards scientific cosmology in particular. At one extreme, we
find ultra-traditional versions of Christianity that emphasize literal
interpretation of Scripture, and that often interpret theological
doctrines in terms of ancient Greek philosophical categories (e.g., God
as eternal, unchangeable, etc.). Even within this more traditional
camp, we find differences in terms of amount of literalism, and amount
of flexibility with regard to traditional theological
doctrines. (e.g., there are ongoing debates among traditional
theologians about the relation of God to time.) At another extreme, we
find more recent incarnations of Christianity that draw heavily on
ideas from German idealism and/or process philosophy. There are also
subtle, but not negligible, differences in attitude among Protestant,
Roman Catholic, and Orthodox Christian theists. Thus, we should not
think of theism as one fixed set of doctrines that is simply
consistent or inconsistent with scientific cosmology.
Furthermore, even though most theological interactions with
cosmology have taken place within the Christian tradition, it has
rarely—if ever—been the case that the defining feature
of Christianity (viz. the unique role of Christ) has played any
explicit role in these interactions.

Philosophy of Cosmology,0.9081671833992004,0.41510871052742,"

Cosmology (the study of the physical universe) is a science that, due
to both theoretical and observational developments, has made enormous
strides in the past 100 years. It began as a branch of theoretical
physics through Einstein’s 1917 static model of the universe
(Einstein 1917) and was developed in its early days particularly
through the work of Lemaître
 (1927).[1]
 As recently as 1960, cosmology was widely regarded as a branch of
philosophy. It has transitioned to an extremely active area of
mainstream physics and astronomy, particularly due to the application
to the early universe of atomic and nuclear physics, on the one hand,
and to a flood of data coming in from telescopes operating across the
entire electromagnetic spectrum on the other. However, there are two
main issues that make the philosophy of cosmology unlike that of any
other science. The first is,

The uniqueness of the Universe: there exists only one universe, so
there is nothing else similar to compare it with, and the idea of
“Laws of the universe” hardly makes sense.

This means it is the historical science par excellence: it
deals with only one unique object that is the only member of its class
that exists physically; indeed there is no non-trivial class of such
objects (except in theoreticians’ minds) precisely for this
reason. This issue will recur throughout this discussion. The second
is

Cosmology deals with the physical situation that is the context in the
large for human existence: the universe has such a nature that our
life is possible.

This means that although it is a physical science, it is of particular
importance in terms of its implications for human life. This leads to
important issues about the explanatory scope of cosmology, which we
return to at the end.

Cosmopolitanism,0.431191235780716,0.6735934615135193,"


The word ‘cosmopolitan’, which derives from the Greek
word kosmopolitês (‘citizen of the world’),
has been used to describe a wide variety of important views in moral
and socio-political philosophy. The nebulous core shared by all
cosmopolitan views is the idea that all human beings, regardless of
their political affiliation, are (or can and should be) citizens in a
single community. Different versions of cosmopolitanism envision this
community in different ways, some focusing on political institutions,
others on moral norms or relationships, and still others focusing on
shared markets or forms of cultural expression. In most versions of
cosmopolitanism, the universal community of world citizens functions
as a positive ideal to be cultivated, but a few versions exist in
which it serves primarily as a ground for denying the existence of
special obligations to local forms of political
organizations. Versions of cosmopolitanism also vary depending on the
notion of citizenship they employ, including whether they use the
notion of 'world citizenship' literally or metaphorically. The
philosophical interest in cosmopolitanism lies in its challenge to
commonly recognized attachments to fellow-citizens, the local state,
parochially shared cultures, and the like.

Possible Objects,0.7962386012077332,0.5778318047523499,"

Deep theorizing about possibility requires theorizing about possible
objects. One popular approach regards the notion of a possible object
as intertwined with the notion of a possible world. There are two
widely discussed types of theory concerning the nature of possible
worlds: actualist representationism and possibilist realism. They
support two opposing views about possible objects. Examination of the
ways in which they do so reveals difficulties on both sides. There is
another popular approach, which has been influenced by the philosophy
of Alexius Meinong. The Meinongian approach is relevant to theorizing
about possible objects because it attempts to construct a general
theory of objects other than ordinary concrete existing objects.
Independently of the debate about the nature of possible worlds or
about Meinongianism, it is not always as straightforward as it may at
first appear to determine whether putative possible objects are indeed
possible. Another category of object similar to that of a possible
object is the category of a fictional object. Although initially
attractive, the idea that fictional objects are possible objects
should not be accepted blindly. An important instance of theoretical
usefulness of possible objects is their central role in the validation
of two controversial theorems of a simple quantified modal logic.

Creation and Conservation,0.6343860626220703,0.2951861321926117,"

In the philosophy of religion, creation is the action by
which God brings an object into existence, while conservation
is the action by which God maintains the existence of an object over
time. The major monotheisms unambiguously affirm that God both created
the world and conserves it. It is less clear, however, whether
creation and conservation are to be conceived as distinct kinds of
actions. The question has its roots in medieval and early modern
characterizations of divine action, and it has received renewed
attention in recent decades.

On the predominant traditional view, conservation is continuous
creation. Adherents of this view typically say with Francisco
Suárez that God’s creation and conservation of things are
“only conceptually distinct” (Suárez 1597,
120). Jonathan Edwards, for example, says, “God’s
upholding created substance, or causing its existence in each
successive moment, is altogether equivalent to an immediate production
out of nothing, at each moment…. So that this effect differs
not at all from the first creation, but only
circumstantially…” (Edwards 1758, 402; emphasis in the
original). In other words, there is no real difference between the act
of creation and the act of conservation, though different words may be
used for them. Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Berkeley all
express similar views. More recently, Philip Quinn likewise treats
both God’s creating and God’s conserving as species of
bringing about a thing’s existence. We call the act
‘creation’ if it occurs at the first time at which the
creature exists, and we call it ‘conservation’ if it
occurs at a later time, but the action is the same (e.g., Quinn 1988,
54). 

The alternative to this view is that the act of conserving beings that
already exist differs from calling beings into existence from nothing.
Some argue that each persisting creature plays a causal role in its
ongoing existence, so that God is not the sole agent as in an ex
nihilo creation. Some also argue that conservation must be an
ongoing act, whereas creation occurs at an instant. 

A large part of what is at stake in the debate is the relationship
between divine action and creaturely action. Continuous creation
theorists may reject a distinction between creation and conservation
as an attempt to attribute a divine prerogative to created things. On
the other hand, those who endorse a distinction may regard continuous
creation theory as (to borrow a phrase) “one of those
high-minded philosophical depreciations of God’s works that come
disguised as compliments to God’s person” (van Inwagen
1988, 46 n4). The debate also raises a number of interesting questions
about causation, time, and their relations.

Creationism,0.6774581074714661,0.5622144937515259,"


At a broad level, a Creationist is someone who believes in a god who
is absolute creator of heaven and earth, out of nothing, by an act of
free will. Such a deity is generally thought to be constantly involved
(‘immanent’) in the creation, ready to intervene as
necessary, and without whose constant concern the creation would cease
or disappear.  Christians, Jews, and Muslims are all Creationists in
this sense. Generally they are known as ‘theists,’
distinguishing them from ‘deists,’ that is people who
believe that there is a designer who might or might not have created
the material on which he (or she or it) is working and who does not
interfere once the designing act is finishing.  The focus of this
discussion is on a narrower sense of Creationism, the sense that one
usually finds in popular writings (especially in America today). Here,
Creationism means the taking of the Bible, particularly the early
chapters of Genesis, as literally true guides to the history of the
universe and to the history of life, including us humans, down here on
earth (Numbers 1992). 

                       
Creationism in this more restricted sense entails a number of beliefs.
These include a short time since the beginning of everything —
‘Young Earth Creationists’ think that Archbishop Ussher's
sixteenth-century calculation of about 6000 years is a good estimate;
that there are six days of creation — there is debate on the
meaning of ‘day’ in this context, with some insisting on a
literal twenty-four hours, and others more flexible; that there was a
miraculous creation of all life including Homo sapiens
— with scope for debate about whether Adam and Eve came together
or if Eve came afterwards to keep Adam company; that there was a
world-wide flood some time after the initial creation, through which
only a limited number of humans and animals survived; and other events
such as the Tower of Babel and the turning of Lot's wife into a pillar
of salt. Creationists (in this narrow sense) have variously been known
as Fundamentalists or biblical literalists, and sometimes —
especially when they are pushing the scientific grounds for their
beliefs — as Scientific Creationists. Today's Creationists are
often marked by enthusiasm for something that is known as Intelligent
Design. Because the relationship between Creationism in the sense of
literalism and Intelligent Design is somewhat complex, examination of
this relationship will be left until later and, until stated
otherwise, the following discussion focusses on literalists.

                 
With signficant provisos to be noted below, Creationists are strongly
opposed to to a world brought on by evolution, particularly to a world
as described by Charles Darwin in his Origin of
Species. Creationists (certainly traditional Creationists) oppose
the fact of evolution, namely that all organisms living and dead are
the end products of a natural process of development from a few forms,
perhaps ultimately from inorganic materials (""common
descent""). Creationists also oppose claims about the total adequacy of
the Darwinian theory of evolution, namely that population pressures
lead to a struggle for existence; that organisms differ in random ways
brought on by errors in the material of heredity
(‘mutations’ in the ‘genes’); that the
struggle and variation leads to a natural form of selection, with some
surviving and reproducing and others failing; and that the end
consequence of all of this is evolution, in the direction of
well-adapted organisms.

Rabbi Hasdai Crescas (ca. 1340–1410/11) was the head of the Jewish

of its most critical periods. Crescas was one of the leading rabbinic
authorities of his
 time,[1]
the political leader of the Jews of Aragon, and a philosophical polemicist

Crescas critiques the radical Aristotelian philosophy of Maimonides and
some of his philosophical heirs. He denounces the different
Aristotelian opinions as contradicting not only the Jewish tradition,
but also the true empirical and rational understanding of the world.
Crescas assembles traditional Jewish opinion, the diverse Aristotelian
sources, the neo-platonic thought of the apostate Abner of Burgos and
the new science of scholastics of the 14th century to create
an original philosophical opinion and critique of Aristotelianism known
to the medieval period. His philosophical book Or Hashem was
an important oeuvre of both Judaic thought and of the criticism of
Aristotelian science which spurred the growth of the new science of the
modern period, which arguably started in the 14th century.

Critical Theory,0.6291265487670898,0.7784459590911865,"


Critical Theory has a narrow and a broad meaning in philosophy and in
the history of the social sciences. “Critical Theory” in
the narrow sense designates several generations of German philosophers
and social theorists in the Western European Marxist tradition known
as the Frankfurt School. According to these theorists, a
“critical” theory may be distinguished from a
“traditional” theory according to a specific practical
purpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human
“emancipation from slavery”, acts as a “liberating
… influence”, and works “to create a world which
satisfies the needs and powers” of human beings (Horkheimer
1972, 246).  Because such theories aim to explain and
transform all the circumstances that enslave human beings,
many “critical theories” in the broader sense have been
developed. They have emerged in connection with the many social
movements that identify varied dimensions of the domination of human
beings in modern societies. In both the broad and the narrow senses,
however, a critical theory provides the descriptive and normative
bases for social inquiry aimed at decreasing domination and increasing
freedom in all their forms.


Critical Theory in the narrow sense has had many different aspects and
quite distinct historical phases that cross several generations, from
the effective start of the Institute for Social Research in the years
1929–1930, which saw the arrival of the Frankfurt School
philosophers and an inaugural lecture by Horkheimer, to the
present. Its distinctiveness as a philosophical approach that extends
to ethics, political philosophy, and the philosophy of history is most
apparent when considered in light of the history of the philosophy of
the social sciences. Critical Theorists have long sought to
distinguish their aims, methods, theories, and forms of explanation
from standard understandings in both the natural and the social
sciences. Instead, they have claimed that social inquiry ought to
combine rather than separate the poles of philosophy and the social
sciences: explanation and understanding, structure and agency,
regularity and normativity.  Such an approach, Critical Theorists
argue, permits their enterprise to be practical in a
distinctively moral (rather than instrumental) sense. They do not
merely seek to provide the means to achieve some independent goal, but
rather (as in Horkheimer's famous definition mentioned above) seek
“human emancipation” in circumstances of domination and
oppression. This normative task cannot be accomplished apart from the
interplay between philosophy and social science through
interdisciplinary empirical social research (Horkheimer 1993). While
Critical Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to the
Frankfurt School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretches
to Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similar
practical aims could be called a “critical theory,”
including feminism, critical race theory, and some forms of
post-colonial criticism. In the following, Critical Theory when
capitalized refers only to the Frankfurt School. All other uses of the
term are meant in the broader sense and thus not capitalized. When
used in the singular, “a critical theory” is not
capitalized, even when the theory is developed by members of the
Frankfurt School in the context of their overall project of Critical
Theory.


It follows from Horkheimer's definition that a critical theory is
adequate only if it meets three criteria: it must be explanatory,
practical, and normative, all at the same time. That is, it must
explain what is wrong with current social reality, identify the actors
to change it, and provide both clear norms for criticism and
achievable practical goals for social transformation. Any truly
critical theory of society, as Horkheimer further defined it in his
writings as Director of the Frankfurt School's Institute for Social
Research, “has as its object human beings as producers of their
own historical form of life” (Horkeimer 1993, 21). In light of
the practical goal of identifying and overcoming all the circumstances
that limit human freedom, the explanatory goal could be furthered only
through interdisciplinary research that includes psychological,
cultural, and social dimensions, as well as institutional forms of
domination. Given the emphasis among the first generation of Critical
Theory on human beings as the self-creating producers of their own
history, a unique practical aim of social inquiry suggests itself: to
transform contemporary capitalism into a consensual form of social
life. For Horkheimer a capitalist society could be transformed only by
becoming more democratic, to make it such that “all conditions
of social life that are controllable by human beings depend on real
consensus” in a rational society (Horkheimer 1972, 249–250). The
normative orientation of Critical Theory, at least in its form of
critical social inquiry, is therefore towards the transformation of
capitalism into a “real democracy” in which such control
could be exercised (Horkheimer 1972, 250). In such formulations, there
are striking similarities between Critical Theory and American
pragmatism.


The focus on democracy as the location for cooperative, practical and
transformative activity continues today in the work of Jürgen
Habermas, as does the attempt to determine the nature and limits of
“real democracy” in complex, pluralistic, and globalizing
societies.


As might be expected from such an ambitious philosophical project and
form of inquiry, Critical Theory is rife with tensions. In what
follows I will develop the arguments within Critical Theory that
surround its overall philosophical project. First, I explore its basic
philosophical orientation or metaphilosophy. In its efforts to combine
empirical social inquiry and normative philosophical argumentation,
Critical Theory presents a viable alternative for social and political
philosophy today. Second, I will consider its core normative
theory—its relation to its transformation of a Kantian ethics of
autonomy into a conception of freedom and justice in which democracy
and democratic ideals play a central role (Horkheimer 1993, 22;
Horkheimer 1972, 203). As a member of the second generation of
Critical Theory, Habermas in particular has developed this dimension
of normative political theory into a competitor to Rawlsian
constructivism, which attempts to bring our pretheoretical intuitions
into reflective equilibrium. In the third section, I will consider its
empirical orientation in practical social theory and practical social
inquiry that aims at promoting democratic norms. A fundamental tension
emerges between a comprehensive social theory that provides a
theoretical basis for social criticism and a more pluralist and
practical orientation that does not see any particular theory or
methodology as distinctive of Critical Theory as such. In this way,
the unresolved tension between the empirical and normative aspects of
the project of a critical theory oriented to the realization of human
freedom is manifest in each of its main contributions to philosophy
informed by social science. Finally, I examine the contribution of
Critical Theory to debates about globalization, in which the potential
transformation of both democratic ideals and institutions is at
stake.

Critical Thinking,0.6068723201751709,0.7928337454795837,"

Critical thinking is a widely accepted educational goal. Its
definition is contested, but the competing definitions can be
understood as differing conceptions of the same basic concept: careful
thinking directed to a goal. Conceptions differ with respect to the
scope of such thinking, the type of goal, the criteria and norms for
thinking carefully, and the thinking components on which they focus.
Its adoption as an educational goal has been recommended on the basis
of respect for students’ autonomy and preparing students for
success in life and for democratic citizenship. “Critical
thinkers” have the dispositions and abilities that lead them to
think critically when appropriate. The abilities can be identified
directly; the dispositions indirectly, by considering what factors
contribute to or impede exercise of the abilities. Standardized tests
have been developed to assess the degree to which a person possesses
such dispositions and abilities. Educational intervention has been
shown experimentally to improve them, particularly when it includes
dialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring. Controversies have
arisen over the generalizability of critical thinking across domains,
over alleged bias in critical thinking theories and instruction, and
over the relationship of critical thinking to other types of
thinking.

Alexander Crummell,0.4863560795783997,0.6622432470321655,"


Alexander Crummell (1819–1898) was the most prominent rationalist of
the black American enlightenment thinkers in the nineteenth-century. He

Cooper, Booker T. Washington, most notably—for his robust defense of
the central place of reason in moral agency. His attempts to work out
the consequences of that view for the nature of language and history
lends his philosophy a breadth and depth not matched by other
enlightenment thinkers. The prominence of his protégé, W.
E. B. Du Bois, helped ensure Crummell's continuing influence during the
rise of pragmatism, but he eventually fell out of favor as such
relativistic thinkers as Alain LeRoy Locke and Zora Neale Hurston

Cultural Evolution,0.6671173572540283,0.6571673750877379,"

In the broadest terms, theories of evolution seek to explain why
species are the ways they are. For many evolutionists, this means
explaining the possession by species of characteristic adaptations. It
also means explaining diversity within species. The general mark of
modern theories of cultural evolution is their insistence on the
significance of cultural inheritance—particularly various forms
of learning from others—for both of these questions. The
prima-facie case for cultural evolutionary theories is irresistible.
Members of our own species are able to survive and reproduce in part
because of habits, know-how and technology that are not only
maintained by learning from others, they are initially generated as
part of a cumulative project that builds on discoveries made by
others. And our own species also contains sub-groups with different
habits, know-how and technologies, which are once again generated and
maintained through social learning. Social learning is also an
important agent of adaptation, and perhaps of speciation, in animals.
The question is not so much whether cultural evolution is important,
but how theories of cultural evolution should be fashioned, and how
they should be related to more traditional understandings of organic
evolution.

The Ethics of Cultural Heritage ,0.6645649075508118,0.6560718417167664,"

Do members of cultural groups have special claims to own or control
the products of the cultures to which they belong? Is there something
morally wrong with employing artistic styles that are distinctive of a
culture to which you do not belong? What is the relationship between
cultural heritage and group identity? Is there a coherent and morally
acceptable sense of cultural group membership in the first place? Is
there a universal human heritage to which everyone has a claim?
Questions such as these concern the ethics of cultural heritage (or
heritage ethics, for short). This entry seeks to provide an overview
of the philosophical work on topics in heritage ethics, as well as
introduce readers to some of the most philosophically relevant
literature from other disciplines.

Running through the specific topics discussed below is a set of common
themes. One theme concerns a tension between universalism and cultural
specificity. On the one hand, there is a pull towards conceiving of
cultural heritage as universally valuable, grounding consequent rights
or permissions for all concerning its use and ownership. On the other
hand, there is a push for culturally specific rights and restrictions
that recognize the special claims of particular cultural groups. A
related theme concerns the distribution of power among cultural groups
and the role that colonial dynamics have played in establishing
current patterns of access to, and control over, cultural heritage. A
third theme concerns how we understand the composition and boundaries
of cultural groups, and whether any such account can avoid charges of
essentialism (the idea that there is a necessary “essence”
to cultural group membership). As we will see, specific controversies
over cultural property, repatriation, cultural appropriation, and
heritage preservation, are each shaped by these recurrent themes.

On the one hand, cultural heritage is about the past, as suggested by
the ubiquitous framing of heritage ethics topics in terms of the
question “Who owns the past?” But on the other hand,
cultural heritage is just as much about the present and the future:
about how culture is embroiled in contemporary moral controversies,
and about what our cultural legacy will be.

Within Western analytic philosophy, culture has not been a major topic
of discussion. It sometimes appears as a topic in the philosophy of
social science, and in continental philosophy, there is a long
tradition of “Philosophical Anthropology,” which deals
with culture to some degree. Within core areas of analytic philosophy,
culture has most frequently appeared in discussions of moral
relativism, radical translation, and discussions of perceptual
plasticity, though little effort has been made to seriously
investigate the impact of culture on these domains. Cognitive science
has also neglected culture, but in recent years, that has started to
change. There has been a sizable intensification of efforts to
empirically test the impact of culture on mental processes. This entry
surveys ways in which the emerging cognitive science of culture has
been informing philosophical debates.

Curry's Paradox,0.873600423336029,0.8603077530860901,"

“Curry’s paradox”, as the term is used by
philosophers today, refers to a wide variety of paradoxes of
 self-reference or circularity
 that trace their modern
ancestry to Curry (1942b) and Löb
 (1955).[1]
 The common characteristic of these so-called Curry paradoxes is the
way they exploit a notion of implication, entailment or consequence,
either in the form of a connective or in the form of a predicate.
Curry’s paradox arises in a number of different domains. Like
 Russell’s paradox, it can take
 the form of a paradox of
set theory or the theory of properties. But it can also take the form
of a semantic paradox, closely akin to the 
  Liar paradox.
Curry’s paradox differs from both Russell’s paradox and
the Liar paradox in that it doesn’t essentially involve the
notion of negation. Common truth-theoretic versions involve a sentence
that says of itself that if it is true then an arbitrarily chosen
claim is true, or—to use a more sinister instance—says of
itself that if it is true then every falsity is true. The paradox is
that the existence of such a sentence appears to imply the truth of
the arbitrarily chosen claim, or—in the more sinister
instance—of every falsity. In this entry, we show how the
various Curry paradoxes can be constructed, examine the space of
available solutions, and explain some ways Curry’s paradox is
significant and poses distinctive challenges.

"Cusanus, Nicolaus [Nicolas of Cusa]",0.6180931925773621,0.2571593225002289,"


Arguably the most important German thinker of fifteenth century,
Nicholas of Cusa (1401–1464) was also an ecclesiastical
reformer, administrator and cardinal. His life-long effort was to
reform and unite the universal and Roman Church, whether as canon law
expert at the Council of Basel and after, as legate to Constantinople
and later to German dioceses and houses of religion, as bishop in his
own diocese of Brixen, and as advisor in the papal curia. His active
life as a Church administrator and bishop found written expression in
several hundred Latin sermons and more theoretical background in his
writings on ecclesiology, ecumenism, mathematics, philosophy and
theology. Cusanus had an open and curious mind. He was learned and
steeped in the Neoplatonic tradition, well aware of both humanist and
scholastic learning, yet mostly self-taught in philosophy and
theology. Nicholas anticipated many later ideas in mathematics,
cosmology, astronomy and experimental science while constructing his
own original version of systematic Neoplatonism. A whole range of
earlier medieval writers, such as Thierry of Chartre, Ramon Llull and
Albert the Great, influenced Nicholas, but his important intellectual
roots are in Proclus and Dionysius the Areopagite. In spite of his
significance few later thinkers, apart from Giordano Bruno, understood

has lost it, and, can God change the past? Damian has often been
depicted as a thinker who, in his defense of divine omnipotence, went
as far as denying the universal validity of the principle of
non-contradiction. For the most part, this depiction of Damian is
unfounded. Nevertheless, De divina omnipotentia is an
interesting document related to the early developments of medieval
discussion concerning modalities and divine omnipotence.

The Philosophy of Dance,0.6622833609580994,0.5102002024650574,"


Dance is practiced in many forms and for many reasons, including
social, educative, political and therapeutic reasons. This article will
consider the philosophy of dance as a Western theater or concert art,
by which I mean the sort of art that is practiced in a performance
space and that is offered for some sort of audience or spectator
appreciation. Further, this entry will focus on the philosophy of dance
that has developed as a subset of philosophical aesthetics, considering
philosophical questions such as “what is the nature
of a dance?” and “how are dance performances appreciated,
experienced and perceived?”


Of course, seeking to answer traditional questions important to
philosophical aesthetics is just one of many ways to approach dance in
order to better understand what it is and why it matters to us. There
are theories and insights offered by dance studies scholars,
historians, educators, anthropologists, practitioners, dance critics
and others, for example, that are relevant to the questions asked by
philosophical aestheticians. Philosophy students and others who are
interested in dance philosophy are strongly advised to consider sources
from outside of the academy of philosophy and to conduct their own
research in a way that makes use of the rich and enlightening work that
comes from these other fields of inquiry. In addition the dance
philosopher must take care to identify which methodology is being used
to discuss which question and for what purposes. While analytic
philosophers of aesthetics might want to know what the
“work” of dance as art is, for example, this may not be a
question of relevance to the continental, pragmatic or process
philosopher (and even less relevant to the dance studies scholar).
Similarly, accounts of dance that focus heavily on the lived experience
of dance as art for both the performer and the audience that answers to
the truth of that experience for dance practitioners may be of interest
to pragmatists and phenomenological philosophers but may not be
accepted as relevant by some analytic philosophers. (For an
anthropological and semiotic approach to dance see Hanna 1987.
For a phenomenological approach to dance see Albright 2011. For a
phenomenological approach to dance, movement and thought that makes
recourse to evolutionary biology see Sheets-Johnstone, 1981 and 1984.
For a process philosophy approach to dance see Manning 2013. For more
on the relation between philosophy and dance see Foster, Rothfield and
Dunagan 2005, Sparshott 2004, and Van Camp 2009.)

Dante Alighieri,0.6275514364242554,0.22486449778079987,"

Dante’s engagement with philosophy cannot be studied apart from
his vocation as a writer, in which he sought to raise the level of
public discourse by educating his countrymen and inspiring them to
pursue happiness in the contemplative life. He was one of the most
learned Italian laymen of his day, intimately familiar with
Aristotelian logic and natural philosophy, theology, and classical
literature. He is, of course, most famous for having written the
Divine Comedy, but in his poetry as well as his philosophical
treatises and other writings, he freely mingles and synthesizes
philosophical and theological language as well extensive references
and allusions to scripture and classical and contemporary poetry.
While his contributions to world literature and other artistic genres are universally
acknowledged, his theological imagination has also remained
influential from his own time to the present day. His philosophical
legacy, by comparison, remains more difficult to assess, though his
writings provide, at the very least, a powerful tool for the study of
the landscape of late medieval and Renaissance philosophy.

Religious Daoism,0.4686017334461212,0.4242188632488251,"
It has become a sinological dogma to
distinguish between the so-called Taoist school (Daojia),
said to have produced the classical mystical texts …, and the
so-called Taoist religion (Daojiao), often said to have begun
in the Later Han period [i.e., the 1st–2nd
centuries CE]. The successive
Daozang [Daoist Canons] never made this distinction. When we
look at the way the terms Daojia and Daojiao occur
in the texts preserved in the Ming Canon [published in 1445], we see
that they are practically synonymous and interchangeable. 
 —Kristofer Schipper (Schipper and Verellen 2004: 6)


There could be no better introduction to the present article than the
passage quoted above from one of the main Western scholarly works on
Daoism (or Taoism), even though it calls into question not only the
relevance of this entry, but also the actual existence of its subject.
Daoist texts do not speak of “philosophy” or
“religion”, two words that do not even exist in the
premodern Chinese language. They speak, instead, of what they call the
“house”, “family” or “lineage of the
Dao” (daojia; also translatable in the plural), and of
what they call the “teachings of the Dao” or
“teachings on the Dao” (daojiao). Daoists, who
obviously have understood these terms in their literal senses, have
seen them as defining the same entity: there cannot be
“teaching” without “lineage”, and vice
versa.

Even if the term “religious Daoism” is accepted, it is not
clear which entity it should define: different scholars might explain
its meaning in different ways. Should “religion” include
all of Daoism except for its “philosophy”? This would
probably exclude the views of the Daode jing (Book of the Way
and Its Virtue;
 §1.1
 below), which Daoists have seen as an integral part—in fact, as
the source—of their tradition. Omitting these views would be
something like writing a survey of Christianity that intentionally
neglects to consider the thought of the theologians. Should
“religion” only include communal ritual with the related
pantheons of gods, on the one hand, and the priestly and monastic
institutions, on the other? If so, an article on “religious
Daoism” would exclude meditation, alchemy, and other individual
practices that Daoists—including those who did not practice
them—have seen as major components of their tradition.

Daoism is a tradition as complex and heterogeneous as Buddhism, Islam,
Judaism, or Christianity. The modern categories of philosophy and
religion can help to comprehend its “otherness” (Seidel
1997: 39) by interpreting its different manifestations according to a
supposedly understood framework. Yet, the use of these categories can
also lead an observer to look only at the aspects of the tradition
that fit the chosen framework, and only within the terms of that
framework. This may result in creating distinctions and boundaries
that do not exist within the tradition itself. Even worse, the whole
issue might simply consist of imposing one cultural model over a
different one.

The present article attempts to take into account the Western
scholarly views on Daoism as well as the Daoists’ views of their
own tradition. As a consequence, it is based on a broad definition of
what we might call Daoist religion (a term that should replace the more
widely-used “religious Daoism”), and also includes views that pertain
to what we might call Daoist philosophy (or Daoist thought, a term
more appropriate than “philosophical
Daoism”).

Darwinism,0.9561157822608948,0.5728325247764587,"


Darwinism designates a distinctive form of evolutionary explanation
for the history and diversity of life on earth. Its original
formulation is provided in the first edition of On the Origin of
Species in 1859.  This entry first formulates ‘Darwin's
Darwinism’ in terms of five philosophically distinctive themes:
(i) probability and chance, (ii) the nature, power and scope of
selection, (iii) adaptation and teleology, (iv) nominalism
vs. essentialism about species and (v) the tempo and mode of
evolutionary change.  Both Darwin and his critics recognized that his
approach to evolution was distinctive on each of these topics, and it
remains true that, though Darwinism has developed in many ways
unforeseen by Darwin, its proponents and critics continue to
differentiate it from other approaches in evolutionary biology by
focusing on these themes.  This point is illustrated in the second
half of the entry by looking at current debates in the philosophy of
evolutionary biology on these five themes.

However, only a few decades later Moses Maimonides, the medieval Jewish

Donald Davidson,0.7940914630889893,0.4830349981784821,"


Donald Davidson was one of the most important philosophers of the
latter half of the twentieth century and with a reception and
influence that, of American philosophers, is perhaps matched only by
that of W. V. O. Quine. Davidson's ideas, presented in a series of
essays (and one posthumous monograph) from the 1960s onwards, have had
an impact in a range of areas from semantic theory through to
epistemology and ethics.  His work exhibits a breadth of approach, as
well as a unitary and systematic character, that is unusual within
twentieth century analytic philosophy. Thus, although he acknowledged
an important debt to Quine, Davidson's thought amalgamates influences
(though these are not always explicit) from a variety of sources,
including Quine, C. I. Lewis, Frank Ramsey, Immanuel Kant and the
later Wittgenstein. And while often developed separately, Davidson's
ideas nevertheless combine in such a way as to provide a single
integrated approach to the problems of knowledge, action, language and
mind. The breadth and unity of his thought, in combination with the
sometimes-terse character of his prose, means that Davidson is not an
easy writer to approach. Given the demanding nature of his work, it is
perhaps only to be expected that it would receive a range of
interpretations and assessments, and this is especially true of much
of the engagement with Davidson's thought that has developed in recent
years. In a number of publications, Ernest Lepore and Kirk Ludwig, in
particular, have advanced a critical interpretation of Davidson's
philosophy that focuses on his earlier work, especially his
contributions to the theory of meaning and philosophy of action, but
that is largely negative in its assessment of the cogency of
Davidson's arguments, and the philosophical viability of the positions
he advances (see, for instance, Lepore and Ludwig 2005). At the same
time, the re-publication of Davidson's later essays has disseminated
them to a wider, and often newly-appreciative, audience, while the
work, not only of Richard Rorty, but also of Robert Brandom, and, to
some extent, John McDowell, is suggestive of a broader and more
positive engagement with Davidson's thinking. In addition, Davidson's
work has also been an important, if sometimes contentious, point of
focus for philosophical interaction between analytic and so-called
‘continental’ thought (particularly in relation to
hermeneutic and literary theory — see, for instance, Malpas
1992, and Dasenbrock 1993). Regardless of divergence in
interpretation, then, Davidson's work still attracts considerable
philosophical attention, and seems likely to have a continuing
influence and significance.

Death,0.5310947895050049,0.8328609466552734,"

This article considers several questions concerning death and its
ramifications.

First, what constitutes death? It is clear enough that people
die when their lives end, but less clear what constitutes the ending
of a person’s life.

Second, in what sense might death or posthumous events harm
us? To answer this question, we will need to know what it is for
something to be in our interests.

Third, what is the case for and the case against the harm
thesis, the claim that death can harm the individual who dies,
and the posthumous harm thesis, according to which events
that occur after an individual dies can still harm that individual?


Fourth, how might we solve the timing puzzle? This puzzle is
the problem of locating the time during which we incur harm for which
death and posthumous events are responsible.

A fifth controversy concerns whether all deaths are
misfortunes or only some. Of particular interest here is a dispute
between Thomas Nagel, who says that death is always an evil, since
continued life always makes good things accessible, and Bernard
Williams, who argues that, while premature death is a misfortune, it
is a good thing that we are not immortal, since we cannot continue to
be who we are now and remain meaningfully attached to life
forever.

A final controversy concerns whether or not the harmfulness
of death can be reduced. It may be that, by adjusting our conception
of our well-being, and by altering our attitudes, we can reduce or
eliminate the threat death poses us. But there is a case to be made
that such efforts backfire if taken to extremes.

The Definition of Lying and Deception,0.7455142140388489,0.7520703673362732,"


Questions central to the philosophical discussion of lying to others
and other-deception (interpersonal deceiving) may be divided into two
kinds. Questions of the first kind are definitional or conceptual.
They include the questions of how lying is to be defined, how
deceiving is to be defined, and whether lying is always a form of
deceiving.  Questions of the second kind are normative — more
particularly, moral.  They include the questions of whether lying and
deceiving are either defeasibly or non-defeasibly morally wrong,
whether lying is morally worse than deceiving, and whether, if lying
and deception are defeasibly morally wrong, they are merely morally
optional on certain occasions, or are sometimes morally obligatory. In

Self-Deception,0.7248502373695374,0.7628447413444519,"

Virtually every aspect of self-deception, including its definition and
paradigmatic cases, is a matter of controversy among philosophers.
Minimally, self-deception involves a person who seems to acquire and
maintain some false belief in the teeth of evidence to the contrary as
a consequence of some motivation, and who may display behavior
suggesting some awareness of the truth. Beyond this, philosophers
divide over whether self-deception is intentional, involves belief or
some other sub-or-non-doxastic attitude, whether self-deceivers are
morally responsible for their self-deception, and whether
self-deception is morally problematic (and if it is in what ways and
under what circumstances), whether self-deception is beneficial or
harmful, whether and in what sense collectives can be self-deceived,
how this might affect individuals within such collectives, whether our
penchant for self-deception was selected for or merely an accidental
byproduct of our evolutionary history, and if it was selected,
why?

The discussion of self-deception and its associated puzzles sheds
light on the ways motivation affects belief acquisition and retention
and other belief-like cognitive attitudes; it also prompts us to
scrutinize the notion of belief and the limits of such folk
psychological concepts to adequately explain phenomena of this sort.
And yet insofar as self-deception represents an obstacle to
self-knowledge, both individually and collectively, it is more than
just another interesting philosophical puzzle. It is a problem of
existential concern, since it suggests that there is a distinct
possibility that we live with distorted views of our selves, others
and the world that may make us strangers to ourselves and blind to the
nature of our significant moral engagements.

Decision Theory,0.7207659482955933,0.8802329897880554,"
Decision theory is concerned with the reasoning underlying an
agent’s choices, whether this is a mundane choice between taking
the bus or getting a taxi, or a more far-reaching choice about whether
to pursue a demanding political career. (Note that “agent”
here stands for an entity, usually an individual person, that is
capable of deliberation and action.) Standard thinking is that what an
agent does on any given occasion is completely determined by her
beliefs and desires/values, but this is not uncontroversial, as will
be noted below. In any case, decision theory is as much a theory of
beliefs, desires and other relevant attitudes as it is a theory of
choice; what matters is how these various attitudes (call them
“preference attitudes”) cohere together.
The focus of this entry is normative decision theory. That is, the
main question of interest is what criteria an agent’s preference
attitudes should satisfy in any generic
circumstances. This amounts to a minimal account
of rationality, one that sets aside more substantial
questions about appropriate values and preferences, and reasonable
beliefs, given the situation at hand. The key issue in this regard is
the treatment of uncertainty. The orthodox normative decision
theory, expected utility (EU) theory, essentially says that,
in situations of uncertainty, one should prefer the option with
greatest expected desirability or value. This simple maxim
will be the focus of much of our discussion.
The structure of this entry is as follows: Section 1 discusses the
basic notion of “preferences over prospects”, which lies
at the heart of decision theory. Section 2 describes the development
of normative decision theory in terms of ever more powerful and
flexible measures of preferences. Section 3 discusses the two
best-known versions of EU theory. Section 4 considers the broader
significance of EU theory for practical action, inference, and
valuing. Section 5 turns to prominent challenges to EU theory, while
Section 6 addresses sequential decisions, and how this richer setting
bears on debates about rational preferences.

Causal Decision Theory,0.7282597422599792,0.8725919127464294,"

Causal decision theory adopts principles of rational choice that
attend to an act’s consequences. It maintains that an account of
rational choice must use causality to identify the considerations that
make a choice rational.

Given a set of options constituting a decision problem, decision
theory recommends an option that maximizes utility, that is, an option
whose utility equals or exceeds the utility of every other option. It
evaluates an option’s utility by calculating the option’s
expected utility. It uses probabilities and utilities of an
option’s possible outcomes to define an option’s expected
utility. The probabilities depend on the option. Causal decision
theory takes the dependence to be causal rather than merely
evidential.

This essay explains causal decision theory, reviews its history,
describes current research in causal decision theory, and surveys the
theory’s philosophical foundations. The literature on causal
decision theory is vast, and this essay covers only a portion of
it.

Descriptive Decision Theory,0.7213863730430603,0.8843598961830139,"

Descriptive decision theory is concerned with characterising and
explaining regularities in the choices that people are disposed to
make. It is standardly distinguished from a parallel enterprise,
normative decision theory, which seeks to provide an account of the
choices that people ought to be disposed to make. Much of the
work in this area has been devoted to the building and testing of
formal models that aim to improve on the descriptive adequacy of a
framework known as “Subjective Expected Utility” (SEU).
This adequacy was first called into question in the middle of the last
century and further challenged by a slew of experimental work in
psychology and economics from the mid 1960s onwards.

This entry first sketches out the basic commitments of SEU, before
moving on to some of its best-known empirical shortcomings and a small
selection of those models that have been proposed to supersede it. The
relation between descriptive decision theory and its normative
counterpart is then discussed, drawing some connections with a number
of related topics in the philosophical
 literature.[1]

Normative Theories of Rational Choice: Expected Utility,0.7260444760322571,0.8757372498512268,"


We must often make decisions under conditions of uncertainty.
Pursuing a degree in biology may lead to lucrative employment, or to
unemployment and crushing debt. A doctor's appointment may result in
the early detection and treatment of a disease, or it may be a waste
of money. Expected utility theory is an account of how to choose
rationally when you are not sure which outcome will result from your
acts. Its basic slogan is: choose the act with the highest expected
utility.


This article discusses expected utility theory as a normative
theory—that is, a theory of how people should make
decisions. In classical economics, expected utility theory is often
used as a descriptive theory—that is, a theory of how
people do make decisions—or as a predictive
theory—that is, a theory that, while it may not accurately model
the psychological mechanisms of decision-making, correctly predicts
people's choices. Expected utility theory makes faulty predictions
about people's decisions in many real-life choice situations (see
Kahneman & Tversky 1982); however, this does not settle whether
people should make decisions on the basis of expected utility
considerations.


The expected utility of an act is a weighted average of the
utilities of each of its possible outcomes, where the utility
of an outcome measures the extent to which that outcome is preferred,
or preferable, to the alternatives. The utility of each outcome is
weighted according to the probability that the act will lead to that
outcome. Section 1 fleshes out this basic definition of expected
utility in more rigorous terms, and discusses its relationship to
choice. Section 2 discusses two types of arguments for expected
utility theory: representation theorems, and long-run statistical
arguments. Section 3 considers counterexamples to expected utility
theory; section 4 discusses its applications in philosophy of
religion, economics, ethics, and epistemology.

Dedekind's Contributions to the Foundations of Mathematics,0.9162121415138244,0.7311211824417114,"

Richard Dedekind (1831–1916) was one of the greatest
mathematicians of the nineteenth-century, as well as one of the most
important contributors to algebra and number theory of all time. Any
comprehensive history of mathematics will mention him for his
investigation of the notions of algebraic number, field, ring, group,
module, lattice, etc., and especially, for the invention of his theory
of ideals (see, e.g., Dieudonné 1985, Boyer & Merzbach
1991, Stillwell 2000, Kolmogorov & Yushkevich 2001, Wussing 2012).
Dedekind's more foundational work in mathematics is also widely known,
at least in parts. Often acknowledged in that connection are: his
analysis of the notion of continuity, his introduction of the real
numbers by means of Dedekind cuts, his formulation of the
Dedekind-Peano axioms for the natural numbers, his proof of the
categoricity of these axioms, and his contributions to the early
development of set theory (Grattan-Guinness 1980, Ferreirós
1996, 1999, 2016b, Jahnke 2003).

While many of Dedekind's contributions to mathematics and its
foundations are thus common knowledge, they are seldom discussed
together. In particular, his foundational writings are often treated
separately from his other mathematical ones. This entry provides a
broader and more integrative survey. The main focus will be on his
foundational writings, but they will be related to his work as a
whole. Indeed, it will be argued that foundational concerns are at
play throughout, so that any attempt to distinguish sharply between
his “mathematical” and his “foundational” work
is artificial and misleading. Another goal of the entry is to
establish the continuing relevance of his contributions to the
philosophy of mathematics, whose full significance has only started to
be recognized. This is especially so with respect to methodological
and epistemological aspects of Dedekind's approach, which ground the
logical and metaphysical views that emerge in his writings.

Defaults in Semantics and Pragmatics,0.7998391389846802,0.8021267652511597,"

The sense and role of defaults in the semantics/pragmatics landscape
is changing swiftly and dynamically. First, it is changing due to the
progression in the debates concerning the delimitation of explicit
content (Jaszczolt 2009a, 2016a). Second, it is propelled by the
debates concerning the literal/nonliteral vis-à-vis salient/nonsalient
distinction (Giora & Givoni 2015; Ariel 2016).  Next, it is
influenced by computational linguistics that develops statistical
models for learning compositional meaning using ‘big data’
(Jurafsky & Martin 2017 [Other Internet Resources]; Liang &
Potts 2015). In what follows I focus on two main aspects of
defaultness in semantics and pragmatics: (i) different
conceptualisations of defaultness, their provenance and their relative
merits, as well as (ii) defaultness vis-à-vis the semantics/pragmatics
boundary disputes.

The term ‘default meaning’ is used in a variety of ways in
the literature, including statistically common interpretation,
predictable meaning, salient meaning, or automatically retrieved
meaning. To begin with a common-sense definition, default
interpretation of the speaker’s utterance is normally understood to
mean salient meaning intended by the speaker, or presumed by the
addressee to have been intended, and recovered (a) without the help of
inference from the speaker’s intentions or (b) without conscious
inferential process altogether.

In post-Gricean pragmatics it has been accepted that communicators
convey more information than is contained in the expressions they
utter. For example, sentences (1a)–(2a) normally convey
(1b)–(2b).

(1a) Tom finished writing a paper and went skating.

(1b) Tom finished writing a paper and then went skating.

(2a) Picasso’s painting is of a crying woman.

(2b) The painting executed by Picasso is of a crying woman.


Such additions to the content of the uttered sentence were called by
Grice (1975) generalized conversational implicatures (GCIs),
that is, instances of context-independent pragmatic inference.
Subsequently, the status of such context-independent additions has
become the subject of heated debates. Some post-Griceans stay close to
Grice’s spirit and propose that there are salient, unmarked, presumed
meanings that occur independently of context (Horn, e.g., 2004, 2012;
Levinson 1995, 2000; Recanati 2004). Some identify default meanings as
those arising automatically in a given situation of discourse
(Jaszczolt, e.g., 2005, 2010, 2016b; Elder & Jaszczolt 2016).
Others reject defaults tout court and subsume such salient
meanings under an unnaturally widened category of context-dependent
pragmatic inference (Sperber & Wilson 1986; Carston 2002).

Next, some, following Grice, consider such pragmatic contributions to
utterance meaning to be generalized conversational implicatures
(Levinson), others classify them as pragmatic input to what is said,
albeit using a variety of theory-specific labels (Recanati, Carston),
reserving the term ‘implicature’ for meanings that can be
represented by a separate logical form and that function independently
from the content of the main utterance in reasoning. Others define
them as contributions to primary meanings where the latter cut across
the explicit/implicit divide (Jaszczolt). Yet another possibility is
to regard them as a separate level of what is implicit in what is said
(Bach 1994, 2007; Horn 2006). In short, the status of such
‘default’ meanings is still far from clear. However, at
least in general terms, there is a reason for drawing a distinction
between salient, automatic enrichments and costly pragmatic inference
since some of these pragmatic contributions go through
normally, as a matter of course. As Horn (2004: 4–5)
puts it,

Whatever the theoretical status of the distinction, it is apparent
that some implicatures are induced only in a special context
(…), while others go through unless a special context
is present (…).


In the above, the differences in using the term ‘default’
consist of the acceptance or rejection of at least the following
properties:

cancellability (also known as defeasibility) of preferred
interpretations;
availability of preferred interpretations without making use of
conscious inference;
shorter time required for their formation by the speaker and
recognition by the addressee as compared with that required for the
meanings induced through inference;
the availability of preferred interpretations prior to the
completion of the processing of the entire proposition (local,
pre-propositional defaults).


Defaults are also relevant in the discussions of the conventional
import of lexical items such as expressives in that their standard
expressive (often offensive) meaning does not arise in certain types
of context. The view on their truth-evaluability (or at least on what
aspects of their meaning are truth-evaluable) is then closely related
to the value one attaches to this context-dependence (Potts 2005;
Richard 2008; Sileo 2017). A separate tradition of the use of defaults
in default inheritance lexical, including computational, semantics
will be briefly touched upon in Section 1.5.

The overview of the major perspectives presented in Section 1 makes it
clear that there is no consensus in the literature as to the unique
set of properties that default interpretations should exhibit, opening
up the discussion as to whether the term has only an intra-theoretic
utility.

Definitions,0.8620473146438599,0.7320452928543091,"


Definitions have interested philosophers since ancient times.
Plato’s early dialogues portray Socrates raising questions about
definitions (e.g., in the Euthyphro, “What is
piety?”)—questions that seem at once profound and elusive.
The key step in Anselm’s “Ontological Proof” for the
existence of God is the definition of “God,” and the same
holds of Descartes’s version of the argument in his
Meditation V. More recently, the Frege-Russell definition of
number and Tarski’s definition of truth have exercised a
formative influence on a wide range of contemporary philosophical
debates. In all these cases—and many others can be
cited—not only have particular definitions been debated; the
nature of, and demands on, definitions have also been debated. Some of
these debates can be settled by making requisite distinctions, for
definitions are not all of one kind: definitions serve a variety of
functions, and their general character varies with function. Some other
debates, however, are not so easily settled, as they involve
contentious philosophical ideas such as essence, concept, and
meaning.

Gilles Deleuze,0.5072058439254761,0.4702976644039154,"


Gilles Deleuze (January 18, 1925–November 4, 1995) was one of
the most influential and prolific French philosophers of the second
half of the twentieth century. Deleuze conceived of philosophy as the
production of concepts, and he characterized himself as a “pure
metaphysician.” In his magnum opus Difference and
Repetition, he tries to develop a metaphysics adequate to
contemporary mathematics and science—a metaphysics in which the
concept of multiplicity replaces that of substance, event replaces
essence and virtuality replaces possibility. Deleuze also produced
studies in the history of philosophy (on Hume, Nietzsche, Kant,
Bergson, Spinoza, Foucault, and Leibniz), and on the arts (a two-
volume study of the cinema, books on Proust and Sacher-Masoch, a work
on the painter Francis Bacon, and a collection of essays on
literature.) Deleuze considered these latter works as pure philosophy,
and not criticism, since he sought to create the concepts that
correspond to the artistic practices of painters, filmmakers, and
writers. In 1968, he met Félix Guattari, a political activist
and radical psychoanalyst, with whom he wrote several works, among
them the two-volume Capitalism and Schizophrenia, comprised
of Anti-Oedipus (1972) and
A Thousand Plateaus (1980).  Their final collaboration was
What is Philosophy? (1991).


Deleuze is noteworthy for his rejection of the Heideggerian notion of
the “end of metaphysics.” In an interview, he once offered
this self-assessment: “I feel myself to be a pure
metaphysician.... Bergson says that modern science hasn’t found its
metaphysics, the metaphysics it would need. It is this metaphysics
that interests me.” [Villani 1999: 130.]) We should also point
to the extent of his non-philosophical references (inter
alia, differential calculus, thermodynamics, geology, molecular
biology, population genetics, ethology, embryology, anthropology,
psychoanalysis, economics, linguistics, and even esoteric thought);
his colleague Jean-François Lyotard spoke of him as a
“library of Babel.” Although it remains to be seen whether
the 20th century will be “Deleuzean,” as his friend Michel
Foucault once quipped, Deleuze’s influence reaches beyond philosophy;
his work is approvingly cited by, and his concepts put to use by,
researchers in architecture, urban studies, geography, film studies,
musicology, anthropology, gender studies, literary studies and other
fields.


One of the barriers to Deleuze’s being better read among mainstream
philosophers is the difficulty of his writing style in his original
works (as opposed to his historical works, which are often models of
clarity and concision). Deleuze’s prose can be highly allusive, as
well as peppered with neologisms; to make matters even more complex,
these terminological innovations shift from one work to the
other. While claims of intentional obscurantism are not warranted,
Deleuze did mean for his style to keep readers on their toes, or even
to “force” them to rethink their philosophical
assumptions. (We will discuss this notion of being
“forced” to think below in 3.1.) As befits an encyclopedia
entry, we will concentrate on the conceptual architecture of his
thought, though readers should be aware that, perhaps more than with
most philosophers, such a treatment of Deleuze’s work removes much of
the performative effect of reading the original.

This entry focuses on the phenomenon of clinical delusions. Although
the nature of delusions is controversial, as we shall see, delusions
are often characterised as strange beliefs that appear in the context
of mental distress. Indeed, clinical delusions are a symptom of
psychiatric disorders such as dementia and schizophrenia, and they
also characterize delusional disorders.  The following case
descriptions include one instance of erotomania, the delusion that
one is loved by someone else, often of higher status, and one instance
of Cotard delusion, the delusion that one is dead or disembodied.
She realized he was empty without her and was pursuing
her, but enemies were preventing them from uniting. The enemies
included a number of people: people in her family, her classmates,
neighbours and many other persons who were plotting to keep them
apart. She knew that her conclusions were accurate because he would
send messages to her proving his love. These messages would often
present themselves as the license plates on cars of a certain state,
the color purple and other indications that she received from the
environment that proved to her that he loved her. (Jordan et
al. 2006, p. 787) 

She repeatedly stated that she was dead and was adamant that she had
died two weeks prior to the assessment (i.e. around the time of her
admission on 19/11/2004). She was extremely distressed and tearful as
she related these beliefs, and was very anxious to learn whether or not
the hospital she was in, was ‘heaven’. When asked how she
thought she had died, LU replied ‘I don’t know how. Now I
know that I had a flu and came here on 19th November. Maybe I died of
the flu.’ Interestingly, LU also reported that she felt ‘a
bit strange towards my boyfriend. I cannot kiss him, it feels
strange—although I know that he loves me.’ (McKay and
Cipolotti 2007, p. 353)



The category of delusions is not homogeneous, and we find that
different delusions have different features. Some delusions have
implausible content (as we saw in the case of Cotard). Other
so-called bizarre delusions include mirrored self
misidentification (the delusion that the person in the mirror is not
one’s reflection but a stranger), and the Capgras delusion (the
delusion that the spouse or a relative has been replaced by an
impostor). The content of other delusions can be plausible and even
true (as in erotomania). One can have the delusion that one is an
uncomprehended genius, that one’s spouse is unfaithful, or that one’s
neighbor is a terrorist, and these may be true beliefs.  What makes
all the above examples instances of delusions is that they
are rigid to some extent, that is, they are not easily given
up in the face of challenges and they tend to resist
counterevidence. Moreover, delusions are reported sincerely and with
conviction, although the behavior of people with delusions is not
always perfectly consistent with the content of their delusions and
their conviction in the delusional content can fluctuate. Another
common feature is that, for people experiencing delusions, the
delusion is often source of distress, and it is found to compromise
good functioning. For instance, people who have delusions of
persecution and believe that they are followed by malevolent others
live in a state of great anxiety and can give up their jobs, stop
communicating with their families, and move cities as a result.

The following first-personal account of delusions illustrates the
pervasive effects of delusions on people’s lives:
I increasingly heard voices (which I’d always called
“loud thoughts” or “impulses with words”)
commanding me to take destructive action. I concluded that other
people were putting these “loud thoughts” in my head and controlling
my behavior in an effort to ruin my life. I smelled blood and decaying
matter where no blood or decaying matter could be found (for example,
in the classrooms at school). I had difficulty concentrating, I
fantasized excessively, and I had trouble sleeping and eating. (Bockes
1985, p. 488)

issues surrounding the controversial definition of delusions, and some
of the common distinctions between types of delusions are

self-deception. The examination of the issues above often culminates

pathological and non-pathological beliefs.

Normative democratic theory deals with the moral foundations of
democracy and democratic institutions. It is distinct from descriptive
and explanatory democratic theory. It does not offer in the first
instance a scientific study of those societies that are called
democratic. It aims to provide an account of when and why democracy is
morally desirable as well as moral principles for guiding the design of
democratic institutions. Of course, normative democratic theory is
inherently interdisciplinary and must call on the results of political
science, sociology and economics in order to give this kind of concrete
guidance.


This brief outline of normative democratic theory focuses attention
on four distinct issues in recent work. First, it outlines some
different approaches to the question of why democracy is morally
desirable at all. Second, it explores the question of what it is
reasonable to expect from citizens in large democratic societies. 
This issue is central to the evaluation of normative democratic
theories as we will see. A large body of opinion has it that most
classical normative democratic theory is incompatible with what we can
reasonably expect from citizens. It also discusses blueprints of
democratic institutions for dealing with issues that arise from a
conception of citizenship. Third, it surveys different accounts of the
proper characterization of equality in the processes of representation.
These last two parts display the interdisciplinary nature of normative
democratic theory. Fourth, it discusses the issue of whether and when
democratic institutions have authority and it discusses different
conceptions of the limits of democratic authority.

Global Democracy,0.4280917942523956,0.688084602355957,"


Global democracy is a field of academic study and political activism
concerned with making the global political system more
democratic. This topic has become a central area of inquiry for
established literatures including political philosophy, international
relations (IR), international law, and sociology. Along with global
justice, global democracy has also been critical to the emergence of
international political theory as a discrete literature in recent
decades. Whereas global justice scholars tend to focus on how burdens
and benefits should be distributed by international institutions,
global democrats probe how political power can be legitimated beyond
the nation-state. Global democracy is therefore concerned with how
transnational decision-making can be justified and who should be
entitled to participate in the formation of global rules, laws, and
regulations.


This short entry contains four sections which elaborate upon the
possibility and problems for global democracy. The first discusses how
globalization impacts upon the nation-state and what this means for
traditional conceptions of democracy. The notion of a global
democratic deficit—in which individuals are removed from
transnational decision-making in problematic ways—is introduced,
and reasons to pursue global democracy are fleshed out. The second
section outlines some prominent normative proposals for global
democracy. Specifically, five ‘models of global democracy’
are presented and some general criticisms are formulated. The third
section then highlights the recent turn toward pursuing ‘values
of democratization’. This new direction for the literature has
both methodological and substantive implications. The final section
highlights persistent criticisms that should be addressed in future

everything else is composed, and that these move about in an infinite
void.  Of the ancient materialist accounts of the natural

Elaborated largely in commentaries and discussions of the Posterior
Analytics itself, but also sometimes in independent opuscula on

of cognition, how mathematical knowledge differs from other sorts of
scientific knowledge, and why mathematical knowledge is more certain,
are explored in this literature. Although the discussion followed
Aristotle's views closely, each interpreter read his views in a way
that would square them with his own metaphysical system, so that the
most important Aristotelian writers of the thirteenth century, Albert
the Great, Thomas Aquinas, and Giles of Rome, revised the initial,
Augustinian, reading of Robert Grosseteste's commentary. Aristotle
himself was obscure on a number of points, and so radical Aristotelian
authors fell into disputes among themselves over the exact character of
the “highest sort of demonstration” (demonstratio
potissima), and the nature of the scientific knowledge resulting
from it. These disputes were rooted in part in earlier disputes among
the Arabic commentators, as reported in Averroes's commentaries. Ockham
and his followers developed yet another reading of the science of
demonstration to fit their nominalist metaphysics in the fourteenth
century, and in the later Middle Ages their views and those of Aquinas
dominated the scene. In later Terminist commentaries, such as that of
Antony Coronel in 1510, it is assumed that scientific knowledge is a
natural form caused in the mind by knowledge of the premisses of a
demonstration, and it is treated as a subject of puzzles concerning
beginning and ceasing, and the like, typical of the sophismata
discussed in that school. In the sixteenth century other controversies
moved to the fore, over the application of the “Science of
Demonstration” to mathematics, and concerning the manner of
discovery of a demonstration through “analysis and
synthesis.” In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with the
new Platonisms, the anti-Aristotelian bias of the new science, and
developing empiricism, the theory of demonstration came to be ignored
in mainstream philosophy, although it persists as an element of
Thomism.

Indexicals,0.7874043583869934,0.6645717024803162,"


An indexical is, roughly speaking, a linguistic expression whose
reference can shift from context to context. For example, the
indexical ‘you’ may refer to one person in one context and
to another person in another context. Other paradigmatic examples of
indexicals are ‘I’, ‘here’,
‘today’, ‘yesterday’, ‘he’,
‘she’, and ‘that’. Two speakers who utter a
single sentence that contains an indexical may say different
things. For instance, when both John and Mary utter ‘I am
hungry’, Mary says that she is hungry, whereas John says that he
is hungry. Many philosophers hold that indexicals have two sorts of
meaning. The first sort of meaning is often called ‘linguistic
meaning’ or ‘character’ (the latter term is due to
David Kaplan, 1989a). The second sort of meaning is often called
‘content’. Using this terminology, we can say that every
indexical has a single unvarying character, but may vary in content
from context to context.


Philosophers have several reasons for being interested in
indexicals. First, some wish to describe their meanings and fit them
into a general semantic theory. Second, some wish to understand the
logic of arguments containing indexicals, such as Descartes’s
Cogito argument. Third, some think that reflection on
indexicals may give them some insight into the nature of belief,
self-knowledge, first-person perspective, consciousness, and other
important philosophical matters.

Reference,0.7844780087471008,0.6597271561622621,"


Reference is a relation that obtains between certain sorts of 
representational tokens (e.g., names, mental states, pictures)
and objects. For instance, when I assert that 
“George W. Bush is a Republican,” I use 
a particular sort of representational token — i.e. the name
‘George W. Bush’— to refer to a particular individual 
— namely, George W. Bush.  While names and other referential
terms are hardly the only type of representational token capable of
referring, linguistic tokens like these have long stood at the center 
of philosophical inquiries into the nature of reference.  Accordingly,
this entry will focus almost entirely on linguistic reference.  
For more on the reference of mental states, see the entries on
causal theories of mental content, 
externalism about mental content, and
teleological theories of mental content. 
For more on the reference of pictures,
see the entry on
Goodman's aesthetics.



Proper names are standardly considered a paradigm example of linguistic
reference — or, more specifically, a relation that obtains between 
certain sorts of linguistic expressions and what speakers use those 
expressions to talk about.  Other expressions which are generally considered
to be of the referring sort include indexicals like ‘I’, 
‘here’, ‘now’, and ‘that’. While it is highly
questionable that all words refer, most philosophers of language assume
that at least certain sorts of terms (e.g. proper names and indexicals) regularly
and reliably do so. It is these sorts of terms that will serve as our primary
focus below. Assuming that at least certain sorts of terms do in fact refer, 
the central question regarding linguistic reference becomes: how do such terms 
refer? What, in other words, is the ‘mechanism’ of 
reference? Subsidiary questions concern the relation 
between reference and meaning, reference and truth, and reference
and knowledge. Some philosophers 
have thought that the nature of reference is able to shed light on 
important metaphysical or epistemological issues. Other philosophers, 
however, are less sanguine. Indeed, certain philosophers have gone so far as
to deny that reference is a substantive relation, one deserving of serious 
philosophical scrutiny.

The word deontology derives from the Greek words for duty

contemporary moral philosophy, deontology is one of those kinds of
normative theories regarding which choices are morally required,
forbidden, or permitted. In other words, deontology falls within the
domain of moral theories that guide and assess our choices of what we
ought to do (deontic theories), in contrast to those that guide and
assess what kind of person we are and should be (aretaic [virtue]
theories). And within the domain of moral theories that assess our
choices, deontologists—those who subscribe to deontological
theories of morality—stand in opposition to

Ontological dependence is a relation—or, more accurately,
a family of relations—between entities
or beings (onta in Greek,
whence ontological). For there are various ways in which one
being may be said to depend upon one or more other beings, in
a sense of “depend” that is
distinctly metaphysical in character and that may be
contrasted, thus, with various causal senses of this word.
More specifically, a being may be said to depend, in such a sense,
upon one or more other beings for its existence or for
its identity. Some varieties of ontological dependence may be
analyzed in modal terms—that is, in terms of distinctly
metaphysical notions of possibility and necessity—while
others seem to demand an analysis in terms of the notion
of essence. The latter varieties of ontological dependence
may accordingly be called species of essential
dependence. Notions of ontological dependence are frequently called
upon by metaphysicians in their proposed analyses of other
metaphysically important notions, such as the notion
of substance.

Depiction,0.7499955892562866,0.4988051652908325,"

Depiction or pictorial representation was studied less intensively by
philosophers than linguistic meaning until the 1960s. The traditional
doctrine that pictures represent objects by copying their appearance
had been challenged by art theorists since the first quarter of the
twentieth century, when what were thought of as illusionistic styles
of painting lost favour, due to the growing prestige of so-called
“primitive” artistic styles, and the fauvist and cubist
experiments of artists at that time. But it took several decades
before philosophers became interested in these debates. When they did
so, it was largely due to the impact of two books: Ernst
Gombrich’s Art and Illusion (1960), and Nelson
Goodman’s Languages of Art (1968). Gombrich explored a
variety of problems about the nature of depiction, the evolution of
style, and the nature of realism, drawing extensively on theories of
visual perception advanced since Helmholtz, and on Karl Popper’s
falsificationist theory of science. Goodman, by contrast defended a
purely conventionalist theory of depiction in general and realistic
depiction in particular, which was rooted in the nominalist philosophy
he had developed in collaboration with W.V.O. Quine. A large part of
the philosophical work on this topic during the past fifty years
consists in attempts to develop theories of depiction in general, and
realistic depiction in particular, which overcome the objections to
their views, while avoiding the simplifications and alleged cultural
bias of the traditional ideas they rejected.

Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) was the founder of
“deconstruction,” a way of criticizing not only both
literary and philosophical texts but also political institutions.
Although Derrida at times expressed regret concerning the fate of the
word “deconstruction,” its popularity indicates the
wide-ranging influence of his thought, in philosophy, in literary
criticism and theory, in art and, in particular, architectural theory,
and in political theory. Indeed, Derrida’s fame nearly reached
the status of a media star, with hundreds of people filling
auditoriums to hear him speak, with films and televisions programs
devoted to him, with countless books and articles devoted to his
thinking. Beside critique, Derridean deconstruction consists in an
attempt to re-conceive the difference that divides self-reflection (or
self-consciousness). But even more than the re-conception of
difference, and perhaps more importantly, deconstruction works towards
preventing the worst violence. It attempts to render justice. Indeed,
deconstruction is relentless in this pursuit since justice is
impossible to achieve.

René Descartes,0.6653550267219543,0.3322004973888397,"


René Descartes (1596–1650) was a creative mathematician
of the first order, an important scientific thinker, and an original
metaphysician. During the course of his life, he was a mathematician
first, a natural scientist or “natural philosopher” second, and a
metaphysician third. In mathematics, he developed the techniques that
made possible algebraic (or “analytic”) geometry. In natural
philosophy, he can be credited with several specific achievements:
co-framer of the sine law of refraction, developer of an important
empirical account of the rainbow, and proposer of a naturalistic
account of the formation of the earth and planets (a precursor to the
nebular hypothesis). More importantly, he offered a new vision of the
natural world that continues to shape our thought today: a world of
matter possessing a few fundamental properties and interacting
according to a few universal laws. This natural world included an
immaterial mind that, in human beings, was directly related to the
brain; in this way, Descartes formulated the modern version of the
mind–body problem. In metaphysics, he provided arguments for the
existence of God, to show that the essence of matter is extension, and
that the essence of mind is thought. Descartes claimed early on to
possess a special method, which was variously exhibited in mathematics,
natural philosophy, and metaphysics, and which, in the latter part of
his life, included, or was supplemented by, a method of doubt.


Descartes presented his results in major works published during his
lifetime: the Discourse on the Method (in French, 1637), with
its essays, the Dioptrics, Meteorology, and
Geometry; the Meditations on First Philosophy (i.e.,
on metaphysics), with its Objections and Replies (in Latin,
1641, 2nd edn. 1642); the Principles of Philosophy, covering his metaphysics
and much of his natural philosophy (in Latin, 1644); and the
Passions of the Soul, on the emotions (in French, 1649).
Important works published posthumously included his Letters
(in Latin and French, 1657–67); World, or Treatise on
Light, containing the core of his natural philosophy (in French,
1664); Treatise on Man (in French, 1664), containing his
physiology and mechanistic psychology; and the Rules for the
Direction of the Mind (in Latin, 1701), an early, unfinished work
attempting to set out his method.


Descartes was known among the learned in his day as a top
mathematician, as the developer of a new and comprehensive physics or
theory of nature (including living things), and as the proposer of a
new metaphysics. In the years following his death, his natural
philosophy was widely taught and discussed. In the eighteenth century
aspects of his science remained influential, especially his
physiology, as did his project of investigating the knower in
assessing the possibility and extent of human knowledge; he was also
remembered for his failed metaphysics and his use of skeptical
arguments for doubting. In the nineteenth century he was revered for
his mechanistic physiology and theory that animal bodies are machines
(that is, are constituted by material mechanisms, governed by the laws
of matter alone). The twentieth century variously celebrated his
famous “cogito” starting point, reviled the sense data
that some alleged to be the legacy of his skeptical starting point,
and looked to him as a model of the culturally engaged philosopher. He
has been seen, at various times, as a hero and as a villain; as a
brilliant theorist who set new directions in thought, and as the
harbinger of a cold, rationalistic, and calculative conception of
human beings. Those new to the study of Descartes should engage his
own works in some detail prior to developing a view of his legacy.

Descartes is not well known for his contributions to ethics. Some have
charged that it is a weakness of his philosophy that it
focuses exclusively on metaphysics and epistemology to the exclusion
of moral and political philosophy. Such criticisms rest on a
misunderstanding of the broader framework of Descartes’ philosophy.
Evidence of Descartes’ concern for the practical import of philosophy
can be traced to his earliest writings. In agreement with the
ancients, he identifies the goal of philosophy with the attainment of
a wisdom that is sufficient for happiness. The details of this
position are developed most fully in writings from the latter part of
Descartes’ career: his correspondence with Princess Elisabeth, The
Passions of the Soul, and the preface to the French translation
of the Principles of Philosophy, where he presents his famous
image of the tree of philosophy, whose uppermost branch is “the
highest and most perfect moral system, which presupposes a complete
knowledge of the other sciences and is the ultimate level of wisdom.”

phenomena by way of mechanical explanations. However, he is most famous

Descartes' Mathematics,0.676582932472229,0.3355022072792053,"


To speak of René Descartes' contributions to the
history of mathematics is to speak of his La
Géométrie (1637), a short tract included with the
anonymously published Discourse on Method. In La
Géométrie, Descartes details a groundbreaking
program for geometrical problem-solving—what he refers to as a
“geometrical calculus” (calcul
géométrique)—that rests on a distinctive
approach to the relationship between algebra and geometry.
Specifically, Descartes offers innovative algebraic techniques for
analyzing geometrical problems, a novel way of understanding the
connection between a curve's construction and its algebraic
equation, and an algebraic classification of curves that is based on
the degree of the equations used to represent these curves.



The problem-solving techniques and mathematical results that Descartes
presents in La Géométrie were both novel and
incredibly influential on the practice of early modern
mathematics. However, we can also locate in La
Géométrie a philosophical significance: The
blending of algebra and geometry and the peculiar approach to the
“geometrical” status of curves which characterize
Descartes' mathematical program stand as notable contributions to the
on-going philosophical debates that surrounded early modern
mathematical practice. By drawing on the context in which Descartes'
mathematical researches took place, and examining the main questions
and issues that shaped Descartes' early mathematical researches, both
the historical and philosophical significance of Books One and Two
of La Géométrie will be highlighted in what

Descartes sometimes speaks of things that have possible existence, in
addition to speaking of things as having actual existence. He also
speaks of eternal and necessary truths that are the product of
God’s free and wholly unconstrained activity. One of the
interpretive projects that is inspired by Descartes’ sometimes
provocative claims about possibility and necessity is the construction
of a general Cartesian theory of modality. Any such theory would of
course need to be sensitive to all of the claims that Descartes makes
that bear on possibility and necessity, but it would also need to
understand and interpret those claims in the light of the terminology
and commitments of his larger metaphysical system.

Descartes' Ontological Argument,0.6660374999046326,0.3448472917079925,"


Descartes' ontological (or a priori) argument is both one of
the most fascinating and poorly understood aspects of his
philosophy. Fascination with the argument stems from the effort to
prove God's existence from simple but powerful premises. Existence is
derived immediately from the clear and distinct idea of a supremely
perfect being. Ironically, the simplicity of the argument has also
produced several misreadings, exacerbated in part by Descartes'
tendency to formulate it in different ways.


The main statement of the argument appears in the Fifth Meditation.
This comes on the heels of an earlier causal argument for God's
existence in the Third Meditation, raising questions about the order
and relation between these two distinct proofs. Descartes repeats the
ontological argument in a few other central texts including the
Principles of Philosophy. He also defends it in the First,
Second, and Fifth Replies against scathing objections by some of the
leading intellectuals of his day.


Descartes was not the first philosopher to formulate an ontological
argument. An earlier version of the argument had been vigorously
defended by St. Anselm in the eleventh century, and then criticized by
a monk named Gaunilo (Anselm's contemporary) and later by St. Thomas
Aquinas (though his remarks were directed against yet another version
of the argument). Aquinas' critique was regarded as so devastating that
the ontological argument died out for several centuries. It thus came
as a surprise to Descartes' contemporaries that he should attempt to
resurrect it. Although he claims not to be familiar with Anselm's
version of the proof, Descartes appears to craft his own argument so as
to block traditional objections.


Despite similarities, Descartes' version of the argument differs from
Anselm's in important ways. The latter's version is thought to proceed
from the meaning of the word “God,” by definition, God is
a being a greater than which cannot be conceived. Descartes' argument,
in contrast, is grounded in two central tenets of his philosophy
— the theory of innate ideas and the doctrine of clear and
distinct perception. He purports not to rely on an arbitrary
definition of God but rather on an innate idea whose content is
“given.” Descartes' version is also extremely
simple. God's existence is inferred directly from the fact that
necessary existence is contained in the clear and distinct idea of a
supremely perfect being. Indeed, on some occasions he suggests that
the so-called ontological “argument” is not a formal proof
at all but a self-evident axiom grasped intuitively by a mind free of
philosophical prejudice.


Descartes often compares the ontological argument to a geometric
demonstration, arguing that necessary existence cannot be excluded
from idea of God anymore than the fact that its angles equal two right
angles, for example, can be excluded from the idea of a triangle. The
analogy underscores once again the argument's supreme
simplicity. God's existence is purported to be as obvious and
self-evident as the most basic mathematical truth. It also attempts to
show how the “logic” of the demonstration is rooted in our
ordinary reasoning practices.


In the same context, Descartes also characterizes the ontological
argument as a proof from the “essence” or
“nature” of God, arguing that necessary existence cannot
be separated from the essence of a supremely perfect being without
contradiction. In casting the argument in these terms, he is
implicitly relying on a traditional medieval distinction between a
thing's essence and its existence. According to this tradition, one
can determine what something is (i.e. its essence), independently of
knowing whether it exists. This distinction appears useful to
Descartes' aims, some have thought, because it allows him to specify
God's essence without begging the question of his existence.

While René Descartes (1596–1650) is well-known as one of the
founders of modern philosophy, his influential role in the development
of modern physics has been, until the later half of the twentieth
century, generally under-appreciated and under-investigated by both
historians and philosophers of science. Not only did Descartes provide
the first distinctly modern formulation of laws of nature and a
conservation principle of motion, but he also constructed what would
become the most popular theory of planetary motion of the late
seventeenth century. As the renowned historian of science Clifford
Truesdell has observed, “[Descartes’ physics] is the beginning
of theory in the modern sense” (Truesdell 1984, 6). Yet, for all
of the forward-looking, seemingly modern, aspects of Descartes’
physics, many of Descartes’ physical hypotheses bear a close kinship
with the Aristotelian-influenced science of late-Medieval and
Renaissance Scholasticism. It is this unique amalgam of both old and
new concepts of the physical world that may account for the current
revival of scholarly interest in Descartes’ physics.

Early modern philosophy in Europe and Great Britain is awash with
discussions of the emotions: they figure not only in philosophical
psychology and related fields, but also in theories of
epistemic method, metaphysics, ethics, political theory and practical
reasoning in general. Moreover, interest in the emotions links
philosophy with work in other, sometimes unexpected areas, such as
medicine, art, literature, and practical guides on everything from
child-rearing to the treatment of subordinates. Because of the breadth
of the topic, this article can offer only an overview, but perhaps it
will be enough to give some idea how philosophically rich and
challenging the conception of the emotions was in this period. Most
attention will be devoted to the familiar figures of early modern
philosophy and how they conceived of the emotions as valuable, even
indispensable aspects of embodied human life, which were largely
constitutive of the self and identity that matter to us

Ideas are among the most important items in Descartes’
philosophy. They serve to unify his ontology and epistemology. As he

January 1642, “I am certain that I can have no knowledge of what
is outside me except by means of the ideas I have within
 me.”[1]
 Descartes never published anything that specifically worked out a
theory of ideas. Even so, he said enough in published and unpublished
work, as well as in correspondence, that allows for a basic
reconstruction of a theory. This entry will focus principally on the
theory of ideas and how it relates to Descartes’ ontology,

Descriptions,0.780064582824707,0.6514400243759155,"


Russell (1919), writing in prison, made the following now famous
declaration of the importance of definite descriptions, and in
particular the definite determiner ‘the’:

… in this chapter we shall consider the word the in
the singular, and in the next chapter we shall consider the word
the in the plural. It may be thought excessive to devote two
chapters to one word, but to the philosophical mathematician it is a
word of very great importance: like Browning’s grammarian with the
enclitic δε, I would give the doctrine of this
word if I were “dead from the waist down” and not merely
in prison.



Russell has not been alone in thinking that descriptions and definite
determiners are important. The discussion of definite and indefinite
descriptions (in English, phrases of the form
‘the F’ and ‘an
F’) has been at the center of analytic philosophy for over a
century now. The reason that philosophers find these apparently simple
expressions so intriguing is that choices made about their proper
logical analysis have repercussions that extend far beyond the
philosophy of language and philosophy of logic. In Bertrand
Russell’s hands, for example, the analysis of descriptions
became a powerful tool for executing important epistemological and
metaphysical projects.


Despite the surface simplicity of determiners and of definite and
indefinite descriptions, the past 100+ years have seen heated debates
about their proper analysis. Some philosophers and linguists treat
descriptions as referential expressions, others have treated them as
quantificational expressions, and some have treated them as
predicational expressions. Other analyses of descriptions have held
that the determiners ‘the’ and ‘a’ do not make
a semantical contribution, but rather a pragmatic contribution to what
is communicated.  Some recent work in linguistics has even called into
question the idea that definite and indefinite determiners correspond
to logical elements in the analysis of the logical form of natural
language. Indeed, there is some reason to think that they are merely

As we will see, none of this undermines the idea that some expressions
of natural language are referential and others quantificational, or
that the analysis of these questions isn’t relevant to Russell’s
epistemological and metaphysical projects, but it is to suggest that
the role of the English words ‘the’ and ‘a’
(and their counterparts in other languages) may be less clear than
philosophers in the one hundred years since Russell have imagined.

Desert,0.3638685345649719,0.7606169581413269,"


Claims about desert are familiar and frequent in ordinary
non-philosophical conversation. We say that a hard-working and
productive student deserves a high grade; that a vicious criminal
deserves a harsh penalty; that someone who has suffered a series of
misfortunes deserves some good luck for a change.  


Philosophers have made use of the concept of desert in several
contexts.  In discussions of the nature of justice, several
philosophers have advocated versions of the idea that justice obtains
when goods and evils are distributed according to desert. In
discussions of the concept of intrinsic value, some philosophers have
suggested that happiness may be the greatest good but it has
outstanding value only when enjoyed by someone who deserves it.  In
theories about moral obligation, some consequentialists have defended
the idea that right acts lead to outcomes in which higher welfare is
preferentially distributed to people who deserve it.  In social and
political philosophy (or philosophy of law) a number of philosophers
have appealed to the concept of desert when discussing the
justification of penalties for violations of law. 


So appeals to desert appear frequently in many contexts, in philosophy
as well as in ordinary non-philosophical talk.  Yet many questions
remain about desert: how can it be distinguished from mere
entitlement?  What is its conceptual structure?  What kinds of things
can be deserving?  What kinds of things can be deserved?  What kinds
of properties can serve as bases on which a deserver deserves a
desert?  How can claims about desert be justified?

Dom Robert Desgabets (1610–1678) was an early defender and
teacher of the Cartesian philosophy at St. Maur in the region of
Lorraine, France.  He was born in Ancemont and in 1636 became a monk
in the Benedictine order. He taught theology at Saint-Evre at Toul
between 1635–1655, and served as Procurer General of Mihiel to Paris
during 1648–49. Although he is little-known today, he played an
important role in the development and transmission of the Cartesian
philosophy, especially in Paris and Toulouse. He is best known for his
role in the theological controversy over the Cartesian explication of
the Eucharist (Desgabets, 1671), and for his defense of Nicolas
Malebranche against the skeptic Simon Foucher (Desgabets, 1675). His
major philosophical writings were not published until
 1983.[1] His
contributions in natural philosophy include pioneering work in the
study of blood transfusion and mechanics. His unusual marriage of
Cartesianism and empiricism challenges many standard views of
Descartes and the Cartesian philosophy.

Teleological Arguments for God's Existence,0.6834056973457336,0.557599663734436,"


Some phenomena within nature exhibit such exquisiteness of structure,
function or interconnectedness that many people have found it
natural—if not inescapable—to see a deliberative and
directive mind behind those phenomena.  The mind in question, being
prior to nature itself, is typically taken to be supernatural.
Philosophically inclined thinkers have both historically and at
present labored to shape the relevant intuition into a more formal,
logically rigorous inference.  The resultant theistic arguments, in
their various logical forms, share a focus on plan, purpose, intention
and design, and are thus classified as teleological arguments (or,
frequently, as arguments from or to design).


Although enjoying some prominent defenders over the centuries, such
arguments have also attracted serious criticisms from a number of
major historical and contemporary thinkers.  Both critics and
advocates are found not only among philosophers, but come from
scientific and other disciplines as well.  In the following
discussion, major variant forms of teleological arguments will be
distinguished and explored, traditional philosophical and other
criticisms will be discussed, and the most prominent contemporary
turns (cosmic fine tuning arguments, many-worlds theories, and the
present Intelligent Design debate) will be tracked.  Discussion will
conclude with a brief look at one historically important
non-inferential approach to the issue.

Desire,0.5797320008277893,0.6355709433555603,"


To desire is to be in a particular state of mind. It is a state of
mind familiar to everyone who has ever wanted to drink water or desired
to know what has happened to an old friend, but its familiarity does
not make it easy to give a theory of desire. Controversy immediately
breaks out when asking whether wanting water and desiring knowledge
are, at bottom, the same state of mind as others that seem somewhat
similar: wishing never to have been born, preferring mangoes to
peaches, craving gin, having world conquest as one's goal, having
a purpose in sneaking out to the shed, or being inclined to provoke
just for the sake of provocation. These varied states of mind have all
been grouped together under the heading of ‘pro attitudes’,
but whether the pro attitudes are fundamentally one mental state or
many is disputed.


In spite of the disputes, it is nonetheless possible to get a fix on
desire itself. Desiring is a state of mind that is commonly associated
with a number of different effects: a person with a desire tends to act
in certain ways, feel in certain ways, and think in certain ways. If
Nora desires tea, for example, then Nora will typically make herself a
cup of tea; if she does not get herself some tea right away she will
nonetheless typically feel the urge to do so; she will find the thought
of tea pleasant and will find her current lack of tea unpleasant; she
will find her thoughts repeatedly turning to the idea of tea; she will
judge that tea seems like a good idea; and so on. These various effects
have been the focus of efforts to develop theories that are theories of
desire.


Understanding desires requires at least two things: first, to have a
theory of desire itself, and second, to have some familiarity with the
varieties of desires that there are. Once acquired, an understanding of
desire can illuminate a number of controversies surrounding desire.

Determinables and Determinates,0.7947051525115967,0.5291190147399902,"

Determinables and determinates are in the first instance type-level
properties that stand in a distinctive specification relation: the
‘determinable-determinate’ relation (for short,
‘determination’). For example, color is a
determinable having red, blue, and other specific
shades of color as determinates; shape is a determinable
having rectangular, oval, and other specific
(including many irregular) shapes as determinates; mass is a
determinable having specific mass values as determinates. Reflecting
that determinables admit of different degrees or levels of
specification, characterization of a property as determinable or
determinate is typically relative; for example, red is a
determinate of color and a determinable of
scarlet.

The determination relation appears to differ from other specification
relations. In contrast with the genus-species and conjunct-conjunction
relations, where the more specific property can be understood as a
conjunction of the less specific property and some independent
property or properties, a determinate is not naturally treated in
conjunctive terms (red is not a conjunctive property
having color and some other property or properties as
conjuncts); and in contrast with the disjunction-disjunct relation,
where disjuncts may be dissimilar and compatible (as with
red or round), determinates of a determinable (at a given
level of specificity) are both similar and incompatible (red
and blue are similar in both being colors; nothing can be
simultaneously and uniformly both red and blue).
Supporting this latter contrast is that our thoughts about
determinables do not appear to be about (potentially infinite)
disjunctions of determinates, and our perceptions of properties such
as color and shape do not appear to be of maximal
determinates, as would be the case if determinables were disjunctions
of determinates (since every instance of a disjunction is an instance
of a disjunct).

Of course, appearances can be deceiving, and there are strategies for
treating determinables and their mode of
specification in deflationary terms. Whether these strategies succeed
or fail is no small issue. For the seemingly distinctive character of
determinables and determination may enter into the best case for the
claim that there are genuine features of reality that are less than
maximally specific—a claim which, if true, has profound
implications for a wide range of philosophical issues.

What follows is organized into five sections. In §1, we trace key
points of the historical trajectory whereby determination came to be
seen as a distinctive form of specification. In §2, we present the
commonly advanced features of determinables, determinates, and their
relation; here also we discuss extensions of the (realistically
construed) relation to ontological categories beyond properties. In
§3, we sketch the main anti-realist, reductionist, and
non-reductionist accounts of determinables and determinates, saying
how these aim to accommodate the seeming features of determinables and
determinates, and flagging key concerns and responses; here also we
discuss certain accounts of the structure or logic of determination.
In §4 we consider reasons for and against thinking that
determinates are metaphysically prior to determinables. In §5 we
present three applications of these notions, on which the distinctive
features of determinables and/or determinates are seen as key to
understanding physical laws of nature, mental/higher-level causation,
and metaphysical indeterminacy.

Epigenesis and Preformation are two persistent ways of describing
and seeking to explain the development of individual organic form. Does
every individual start from material that is unformed, and the form
emerges only gradually, over time? Or does the individual start in some
already preformed, or predelineated, or predetermined way? The
questions are part metaphysical: what is it that exists — form or
also the unformed that becomes the formed? And they are partly
epistemological: how do we know — through observation or
inference? The debate has persisted since ancient times, and today
plays out as genetic determinists appeal to the already
“formed” through genetic inheritance, while others insist
on the efficacy of environmental plasticity. Nature or nurture,
epigenesis or preformation, genetic determinism or developmental free
will, or is some version of a middle ground possible? These are the
terms of this perennial discussion, and the underlying assumptions

Dewey's Moral Philosophy,0.6045640110969543,0.7773517370223999,"

John Dewey (1859–1952) lived from the Civil War to the Cold War,
a period of extraordinary social, economic, demographic, political and
technological change. During his lifetime the United States changed
from a rural to an urban society, from an agricultural to an
industrial economy, from a regional to a world power. It absorbed
millions of immigrants from Europe and Asia, but faced wrenching
conflicts between capital and labor as they were integrated into the
urban industrial economy. As the face-to-face communal life of small
villages and towns waned, it confronted the need to create new forms
of community life capable of sustaining democracy on urban and
national scales. Dewey believed that neither traditional moral norms
nor traditional philosophical ethics were able to cope with the
problems raised by these dramatic transformations. Traditional
morality was adapted to conditions that no longer existed. Hidebound
and unreflective, it was incapable of changing to address the problems
raised by new circumstances. Traditional philosophical ethics sought
to discover and justify fixed moral goals and principles by dogmatic
methods. Its preoccupation with reducing the diverse sources of moral
insight to a single fixed principle subordinated practical service to
ordinary people to the futile search for certainty, stability, and
simplicity. In practice, both traditional morality and philosophical
ethics served the interests of elites at the expense of most
people. To address the problems raised by social change, moral
practice needed to acquire the disposition to respond intelligently to
new circumstances. Dewey saw his reconstruction of philosophical
ethics as a means to effect this practical reconstruction.

Dewey’s ethics replaces the goal of identifying an ultimate end
or supreme ethical principle with the goal of identifying a method for
improving our value judgments. Dewey argued that ethical inquiry is
the use of reflective intelligence to revise our judgments in light of
the consequences of acting on them. Value judgments are tools for
satisfactorily redirecting conduct when habits fail. As tools, they
can be evaluated instrumentally. We test our value judgments by
putting them into practice and seeing whether the results are
satisfactory — whether they solve our problems with acceptable
side-effects, whether they enable successful responses to novel
problems, whether living in accordance with alternative value
judgments yields more satisfactory results. We make moral progress by
adopting habits of reflectively revising our value judgments in
response to the widest consequences for everyone of following them.
The conditions of warrant for value judgments lie in human conduct,
not in any a priori fixed reference point outside of conduct,
such as God’s commands, Platonic Forms, pure reason, or
nature. Dewey offers a naturalistic metaethic of value judgments,
grounded in developmental and social psychology.

Dewey's Political Philosophy,0.6088670492172241,0.7748878598213196,"


John Dewey (1859-1952) was an American philosopher, associated with
pragmatism.  His immense philosophical and other written output
encompasses most areas of philosophy as well as a host of other
educational, social and political concerns. Although much of Dewey’s
political writing is prompted by specific issues, his overall
orientation is deeply shaped by his pragmatism or (as he preferred)
“experimentalism”. At the core of his political thinking are the
beliefs that science and democracy are mutually supportive and
interdependent enterprises, that they are egalitarian, progressive and
rest on habits of open social communication, and that powerful
interpretations of liberal individualism and democracy have become
ossified and self-defeating. 


Dewey’s earliest philosophical work was deeply influenced by the
Idealism imbibed from his teacher and colleague George
S. Morris. Through the 1890s, and particularly after a move to the
newly founded University of Chicago in 1894, Dewey began a steady
drift away from Idealist metaphysics, a process that he describes in
an autobiographical essay “From Absolutism to
Experimentalism”. Influenced notably by William James’s Principles
of Psychology (1890), Dewey came to repudiate both the Idealist’s
claim that the study of empirical phenomena leads to the conclusion
that the world is mind, and the belief that the only alternative to
this is an atomistic empiricism. Yet he retained the Idealist ambition
of articulating a unified account of human progress.  While at Chicago
Dewey’s interest in educational theory and conception of the school as
a central institution for a democratic society came to fruition, in
the foundation of the University Elementary School (the “Lab School”),
and in books such as The School and Society (1899), The
Child and the Curriculum (1902), and later in the culminating
statement Democracy and Education (1916). After a dispute
with the university president, Dewey left Chicago in 1904 for Columbia
University, where he remained until his retirement.


The period between the wars also saw an imposing series of books
articulating and developing his philosophical beliefs. This includes
Reconstruction in Philosophy (1920), Human Nature and
Conduct (1922), Experience and Nature (1925), The
Quest for Certainty (1929), Art as Experience (1934),
A Common Faith (1934), Logic: The Theory of Inquiry
(1938), and Theory of Valuation (1939).  The Public and
Its Problems (1927) contained a defence of participatory
democratic ideals against sceptics such as Walter Lippmann, who argued
that there was only space for a minimally democratic politics in
complex modern societies. Dewey was a critic of laissez-faire
liberalism and its accompanying individualistic view of society from
his early writings. This criticism was amplified during the
Depression, where he expressed a form of liberal and democratic
socialism in writings such as Individualism, Old and New
(1930), Liberalism and Social Action (1935), and Freedom
and Culture (1939).


As a public intellectual, Dewey was a supporter of such causes as
women’s suffrage and the Settlement House movement (he was a frequent
visitor to the philosopher Jane Addams’s and Ellen Gates Starr’s
famous Hull House in Chicago). He lectured to international audiences
and his educational writing in particular was influential in a wide
range of settings, including notably China. His immense range of
public and political activities included presidency of the teachers’
union, sponsorship of the American Civil Liberties Union and NAACP,
support for the Outlawry of War movement in the interwar years,
chairing the People’s Lobby, and (persuaded by his student Sidney
Hook) participation in the “trial” of Leon Trotsky in Mexico in
1938. After his move to New York, and particularly after the onset of
the First World War, a substantial part of his published output
consisted of commentary on current domestic and international
politics, and public statements on behalf of many causes, both
domestic and international. (He is probably the only philosopher in
this Encyclopaedia to have published both on the Treaty of Versailles
and on the value of displaying art in post offices.) He was a
prominent critic from the left of Roosevelt’s New Deal while at the
same time opposing Soviet communism and its western apologists. By the
time of his death he was lionized as a national sage (as with Bertrand
Russell, this status was compatible with his promotion of
controversial and often radical public positions). Both his
philosophical reputation and public status dimmed somewhat in
subsequent years. However, his work has remained an important
reference point and resource for democratic theory.

Dharmakīrti,0.7353139519691467,0.3258943259716034,"

The life of Dharmakīrti, a profound and rigorous philosopher of
Indian Buddhism, is a subject of hagiography with little solid data
upon which we can confidently
 rely.[1]
 If we go by Tibetan sources, he seems to have been born in South
India and then to have moved to the great monastic university of
Nālandā (in present day Bihar state) where he was supposedly
in contact with other Buddhist luminaries, such as Dharmapāla
(530–561 C.E.). Tibetan sources describe his life in very
colorful terms. Indeed some make him out as initially a
Mīmāṃsaka who then broke with that non-Buddhist
school; others depict him as extraordinarily skilled in debate and
hint at a difficult and arrogant personality. Judging by the opening
verses in his most famous (and by far his longest) work, the
Pramāṇavārttika (Commentary on
Epistemology), Dharmakīrti himself thought that his
philosophy would not be understood by his contemporaries because of
their small-minded vanity. At the end of the
Pramāṇavārttika, he went further and
prophesied that his work of unrivalled depth would never receive its
proper recognition, but would age in obscurity locked away in
 itself.[2]

He was wrong about that, fortunately for us. His philosophy certainly
did find recognition, at least it did in many parts of Asia. He, and
his predecessor Dignāga (c. 480–c. 540 C.E.), were
responsible for a school of Buddhist thought that actually had no name
in Sanskrit, although in Tibetan it was known as “those who
follow reasoning” (rigs pa rjes su ‘brang ba); in
modern literature it is sometimes known by the convenient Sanskrit
misnomer pramāṇavāda, or more simply,
“the Epistemological School.” In any case, it is the
Buddhist school that provoked the most sophisticated and most
important philosophical debates with non-Buddhist rivals. It
represented Buddhism in the pan-Indian debates on problems of
universals, philosophies of logic and language, and issues of
justification, and had an enormous influence on Mahāyāna
Buddhism in Central Asia, especially in Tibet. Finally, although its
influence was relatively limited in medieval China (only a few of the
works of Dignāga were translated into Chinese, none of the works
of Dharmakīrti were translated), it has nonetheless become
increasingly important in modern Japan in supplying the epistemology
for Buddhist thought.

It is still debated in the modern community of researchers on
Dharmakīrti whether one should place this philosopher in the
seventh century C.E. or in the sixth. Part of the reason for this
indecision is that a significant time seems to have elapsed before
Dharmakīrti achieved notoriety in India, although it is unclear
how much. Erich Frauwallner came out strongly for 600–660 C.E.
as Dharmakīrti's dates, using an argumentum ex silentio
that is short of conclusive—hardly more than one piece in the
 puzzle.[3]
 One problem is that there may indeed be some counterevidence that
would place Dharmakīrti a half-century earlier, inter
alia his possible connections with Dharmapāla, a
sixth-century idealist philosopher who, according to Tibetan
historians, was the monk that ordained Dharmakīrti. Some have
thought that there is even a reference to Dharmakīrti in
Dharmapāla's commentary to Dignāga's
Ālambanaparīkṣā (“Analysis of the
object [of perception]”). However, because this commentary is
only available to us at this time in Chinese in an unreliable
translation by Yijing, it is not clear that the passage in question
does in fact refer to Dharmakīrti. Caution or even agnosticism on
the matter of Dharmakīrti's dates still seems to be warranted,
although the scales seem to be tipping towards an earlier date.
Krasser (2012) relies heavily on connections between Dharmakīrti,
Bhāviveka and Kumārila to push the dates of
Dharmakīrti's activity back to the mid sixth century C.E.
 [4]

Leaving aside the question of dates, Frauwallner (1954) did most
likely pin down the order in which Dharmakīrti composed five of
his seven works, namely, and in this order, the
Pramāṇavārttika,
Pramāṇaviniścaya (“Ascertainment of
Epistemology”), Nyāyabindu (“Drop of
Reasoning”), Hetubindu (“Drop of Logical
Reasons”), and Vādanyāya (“Logic of
Argumentation”). The two minor works, the
Sambandhaparīkṣā (“Analysis of
Relations”) and Saṃtānāntarasiddhi
(“Proof of Other Minds”), are more difficult to place in
the sequence. There is also an autocommentary to the
Pramāṇavārttika, the
Pramāṇavārttikasvavṛtti. However, the
hypothesis of Frauwallner that there was a proto-text that later
became the Pramāṇavārttikasvavṛtti is
still speculative.

In what follows, most of our discussion will center around the
Pramāṇavārttika, as it is by far the largest
and most important of Dharmakīrti's works. It is an unfinished,
highly philosophical, commentary on the
Pramāṇasamuccaya (“Compendium of
Epistemology”) of Dignāga. At various key places in the
text we see that Dharmakīrti seems to have formulated some basic
ideas as a reaction to now lost commentaries by Dignāga's
students, the most important being the commentary on the
Pramāṇasamuccaya by Īśvarasena. A
notable reaction to Īśvarasena is Dharmakīrti's
emphasis on certainty (niścaya) (see sections
 1.4
 and
 3.1).
 There are also innovations that, as far as we know, were not provoked
by earlier commentators. Whether in metaphysics, epistemology or
philosophy of language, causal theories carry considerable
philosophical weight. These theories are probably to quite a degree
original, not found in Dignāga's own writings. In what follows,
we will examine what we consider to be the most salient features of
Dharmakīrti's philosophy, bringing out inter alia the
importance of this causal stance. It is however impossible to discuss
all the major themes that were traditionally commented upon by
Buddhist scholastic writers on Dharmakīrti. Choices and
exclusions had to be made. For readers who seek a comprehensive
treatment of the historical development of Dharmakīrti's
positions in his seven works, the best reference to date is

Hegel's Dialectics,0.6155530214309692,0.5045338273048401,"

“Dialectics” is a term used to describe a method of
philosophical argument that involves some sort of contradictory
process between opposing sides. In
what is perhaps the most classic version of “dialectics”,
the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato (see entry on
 Plato),
 for instance, presented his philosophical argument as a
back-and-forth dialogue or debate, generally between the character of
Socrates, on one side, and some person or group of people to whom
Socrates was talking (his interlocutors), on the other. In the course
of the dialogues, Socrates’ interlocutors propose definitions of
philosophical concepts or express views that Socrates challenges or
opposes. The back-and-forth debate between opposing sides produces a
kind of linear progression or evolution in philosophical views or
positions: as the dialogues go along, Socrates’ interlocutors
change or refine their views in response to Socrates’ challenges
and come to adopt more sophisticated views. The back-and-forth
dialectic between Socrates and his interlocutors thus becomes
Plato’s way of arguing against the earlier, less sophisticated
views or positions and for the more sophisticated ones
later.

“Hegel’s dialectics” refers to the particular
dialectical method of argument employed by the 19th Century German
philosopher, G.W.F. Hegel (see entry on
 Hegel),
 which, like other “dialectical” methods, relies on a
contradictory process between opposing sides. Whereas Plato’s
“opposing sides” were people (Socrates and his
interlocutors), however, what the “opposing sides” are in
Hegel’s work depends on the subject matter he discusses. In his
work on logic, for instance, the “opposing sides” are
different definitions of logical concepts that are opposed to one
another. In the Phenomenology of Spirit, which presents
Hegel’s epistemology or philosophy of knowledge, the
“opposing sides” are different definitions of
consciousness and of the object that consciousness is aware of or
claims to know. As in Plato’s dialogues, a contradictory process
between “opposing sides” in Hegel’s dialectics leads
to a linear evolution or development from less sophisticated
definitions or views to more sophisticated ones later. The dialectical
process thus constitutes Hegel’s method for arguing against the
earlier, less sophisticated definitions or views and for the more
sophisticated ones later. Hegel regarded this dialectical
method or “speculative mode of cognition” (PR §10) as
the hallmark of his philosophy, and used the same method in the
Phenomenology of Spirit [PhG], as well as in all of the
mature works he published later—the entire Encyclopaedia of
Philosophical Sciences (including, as its first part, the
“Lesser Logic” or the Encyclopaedia Logic [EL]),
the Science of Logic [SL], and the Philosophy of
Right [PR].

Note that, although Hegel acknowledged that his dialectical method was
part of a philosophical tradition stretching back to Plato, he
criticized Plato’s version of dialectics. He argued that
Plato’s dialectics deals only with limited philosophical claims
and is unable to get beyond skepticism or nothingness (SL-M
55–6; SL-dG 34–5; PR, Remark to §31). According to
the logic of a traditional reductio ad absurdum argument, if
the premises of an argument lead to a contradiction, we must conclude
that the premises are false—which leaves us with no premises or
with nothing. We must then wait around for new premises to spring up
arbitrarily from somewhere else, and then see whether those new
premises put us back into nothingness or emptiness once again, if
they, too, lead to a contradiction. Because Hegel believed that reason
necessarily generates contradictions, as we will see, he thought new premises
will indeed produce further contradictions. As he puts the argument,
then, 


the scepticism that ends up with the bare abstraction of nothingness
or emptiness cannot get any further from there, but must wait to see
whether something new comes along and what it is, in order to throw it
too into the same empty abyss. (PhG §79) 


Hegel argues that, because Plato’s dialectics cannot get beyond
arbitrariness and skepticism, it generates only approximate truths,
and falls short of being a genuine science (SL-M 55–6; SL-dG
34–5; PR, Remark to §31; cf. EL Remark to §81).

Dialetheism,0.8269346952438354,0.7532238960266113,"


A dialetheia is a sentence, \(A\), such that both it
and its negation, \(\neg A\), are true.
If falsity is assumed to be the truth of negation, a dialetheia is a sentence which is both true and false. Such a sentence is, or has, what is called a truth value glut, in distinction to a gap, a sentence that is neither true nor false. (We shall talk of sentences throughout this entry; but one could run the definition in terms of propositions, statements, or whatever one takes as one’s favourite
truth-bearer: this would make little difference in the context.)

Dialetheism is the view that there are dialetheias. If we
define a contradiction as a couple of sentences, one of which is the
negation of the other, or as a conjunction of such sentences, then dialetheism amounts to the claim that there are true
contradictions. As such, dialetheism opposes—contradicts—the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC), sometimes also called the Law of
Contradiction. The Law can be expressed in various ways; fixing the precise formulation is itself a topic of debate (Priest et al 2004, Part II). Thomas Reid put the LNC
in the form ‘No proposition is both true and false’. 
A strong (modal) statement of the LNC is: for any \(A\), 
it is impossible that both \(A\) and
\(\neg A\) be true. 


In Book \(\Gamma\) of the Metaphysics, Aristotle introduced
(what was later to be called) the LNC as “the most certain of all
principles” (1005b24)—firmissimum omnium
principiorum, as the Medieval theologians said. Since Aristotle, there have been few sustained attempts to defend the law. The LNC has been an (often unstated) assumption, felt to be so fundamental to rationality that some claim it cannot be defended, e.g. David Lewis 1999.
As a challenge to the LNC, therefore, dialetheism assails what most philosophers take to be unassailable common sense, calling into question the rules for what can be called into question (cf. Woods 2003, 2005; Dutilh Novaes 2008). 



Since the advent of
paraconsistent logic in the second half of the twentieth century,
dialetheism has been developed as a view in philosophical logic, with precise formal language. 
Dialetheism has been most famously advanced as a response to logical paradoxes, in tandem with a paraconsistent logic. The view has been gaining, if not acceptance, the respect of other parties in the debate; one critic writes that dialetheists have shown,

as clearly as anything like this can be shown, that it is coherent to maintain that some sentences can be true and false at the same time. … [A]nd that perhaps is a radical conclusion, and a major advance in our understanding of the issues (Parsons 1990).



In this article, 1) we will start by explaining the connection between
dialetheism and other important related concepts, such as the ones of
trivialism and paraconsistency. Next, we will describe 2) the history
of dialetheism and 3) the motivations for contemporary dialetheism, 
among which the logical (semantic and set-theoretic)
paradoxes figure prominently, though not exclusively. We will then 4)
indicate and discuss some of the objections to dialetheism, and 5) its
connections with the notion of rationality. Finally, 6) we will point
at some possible themes for further inquiry concerning the connections
between dialetheism, realism and antirealism in metaphysics.

The extraordinary long life and active teaching career of Albert the
Great (c.1193–1280) produced many benefits for the inception of
philosophy in medieval Germany. Besides the vast corpus of his
writings that fostered a generation of Dominican scholars in the
German-speaking province, Albert lived long enough to impart
continuity to this generation, which included Ulrich of
Straßburg (c.1225–1277), Dietrich of Freiberg

of these men made extraordinary contributions to medieval philosophy,
theology, and in the case of Dietrich of Freiberg, natural
science. However, of all those who were formed in the shadow of
Albert, Dietrich showed the most marked tendency to Albert's

The Philosophy of Digital Art,0.8488653898239136,0.4153177738189697,"
First and foremost, the philosophy of digital art is the study of
the nature and appreciative grounds of all those kinds of art whose
production and presentation crucially involves computer processing.
This first-order inquiry cannot proceed without acknowledgment of
claims made by media and cultural theorists, art theorists and art
audiences, concerning the way digital image- and sound-making
technologies are fundamentally changing our understanding of art,
representation, and perceptual experience. These claims suggest that
the “digital condition” induces a loss of trust in the
image, a new way of experiencing the world as indeterminate and
fragmentary, and a breakdown of traditional boundaries between artist
and audience, artwork and artistic process. Testing these claims
requires a formal understanding of the distinction between analog and
digital systems and the implications of that distinction for aesthetic
appreciation. The philosophy of digital art proceeds from a carefully
articulated general account of digital representation to an
investigation of the precise ways in which different kinds of digital
art are digital. This leads to a further investigation into the ways
an artwork’s digital status bears on its appropriate
appreciation.  By conducting a systematic analysis of the digital as
an artistically significant category, the philosophy of digital art
seeks to ground burgeoning interdisciplinary and popular interest in
the so-called “digital revolution”.
 The philosophy of digital art is not yet a well-established
subfield. At present, work in the field is limited to isolated
treatments of particular digital art forms. Three recent monographs,
one on video games (Tavinor 2009), one on digital cinema (Gaut 2010),
and one on computer art (Lopes 2010), have been invaluable in
demonstrating the philosophical richness of questions concerning art
and computer technology. But there is still a great deal of
philosophical work to be done. Digital art has been part of the
mainstream art world since the late 1990s (Paul 2008), and with so
much of it networked, the reach of digital art extends far beyond the
traditional gallery. Scholars in other disciplines have been quick to
claim digital cinema and photography, videogames and virtual reality,
as new subjects for theorizing. What is needed from philosophers is a
general conceptual framework for an interdisciplinary discussion of
the true extent to which the digital has revolutionized art and
media.

Wilhelm Dilthey,0.6362842321395874,0.5338454246520996,"

Wilhelm Dilthey was a German philosopher who lived from
1833–1911. Dilthey is best known for the way he distinguished
between the natural and human sciences. Whereas the main task of the
natural sciences is to arrive at law-based causal explanations, the
core task of the human sciences is the understanding of the
organizational structures of human and historical life. It will be
shown that this distinction is not so sharp as to rule out causal
explanations in human sciences such as psychology and history; it
merely delimits the scope of such explanations. Dilthey’s aim
was to expand Kant’s primarily nature-oriented Critique of
Pure Reason into a Critique of Historical Reason that
can also do justice to the social and cultural dimensions of human
experience. Understanding the meaning of human historical events
requires being able to organize them in their proper contexts and to
articulate the structural uniformities that can be found in this way.
Dilthey’s reflections on the human sciences, historical
contextualization and hermeneutics influenced many subsequent thinkers
such as Husserl, Heidegger, Cassirer, Gadamer and Ricoeur. Recently,
there has been some attention given to the ways in which
Dilthey’s empirical approach to experience influenced Carnap in
his early attempts to overcome metaphysics.

The Problem of Dirty Hands,0.5202420353889465,0.6558060050010681,"


Should political leaders violate the deepest constraints of morality
in order to achieve great goods or avoid disasters for their
communities? This question poses what has become known amongst
philosophers as the problem of dirty hands. There are many different
strands to the philosophical debate about this topic, and they echo
many of the complexities in more popular thinking about politics and
morality. All, however, involve the idea that correct political action
must sometimes conflict with profound moral norms. This entry seeks to
unravel these strands and clarify the central normative issues about
politics that the cry of ‘dirty hands’ evokes. Beginning
with an illustrative passage from a renowned 19th century
English novel, the essay traces the dirty hands tradition back to
Machiavelli, though its present vogue is owed mostly to the writings
of the distinguished American political theorist, Michael Walzer.
Walzer’s views are explored in the light of earlier theorists such as
Machiavelli and Max Weber and certain vacillations in his intellectual
posture are briefly discussed. This leads to the posing of five issues
with which the entry is principally concerned. First, is the dirty
hands problem simply confused and its formulation the merest
contradiction? Second, does the overriding of moral constraints take
place within morality or somehow beyond it? Third, can the cry of
dirty hands be restricted wholly or principally to politics or does it
speak equally to other areas of life, and, where politics is
concerned, do only the principal agents get dirty hands or do their
citizens share in the taint? This is the problem of scope. Fourth, how
are the circumstances that call for dirty hands best described?
Fifth, the dirty hands problem has affinities with the problem raised
by moral dilemmas, but the question is: should those similarities be
allowed to obscure significant differences?


In the course of addressing these issues, the dirty hands challenge is
also distinguished from that of political realism, with which it has
some affinities, and the resort to role morality to render dirty hands
coherent is discussed, as is the issue of the desirability of shaming
or punishing dirty hands agents. The relevance of “threshold
deontology” is explored, and it is suggested that much of the
point of invoking dirty hands comes from an ambiguous attitude to
absolute moral prohibitions, combining a rejection of them with a
certain wistful attachment to their flavour.

"Disability: Definitions, Models, Experience",0.4877266883850098,0.8154657483100891,"

Philosophers have always lived among people who could not see, walk,
or hear; who had limited mobility, comprehension or longevity, or
chronic illnesses of various sorts. And yet philosophical interest in
these conditions was piecemeal and occasional until the past hundred
or so years. Some of these conditions were cited in litanies of life's
hardships or evils; some were the vehicle for inquiries into the
relationship between human faculties and human knowledge [see SEP
entry on “Molyneux's Problem”]. But the treatment of
disability as a subject of philosophical interest is relatively
new.

The lack of attention to “disability” or
“impairment” in general may have a simple explanation:
there were no such concepts to attend to until 19th century
scientific thinking put variations in human function and form into
categories of abnormality and deviance. Once such categories were
established, it became possible to talk, and generalize, about
“the disabled,” and philosophers have done so for various
purposes (Hacking, 1990; Davis, 2002, Ch. 4)). The resurgent political
philosophy of the second half of the last century, preoccupied with
eliminating or reducing unearned disadvantages, tended to treat
disability as a primary source of those disadvantages, to be addressed
with medical correction or government compensation. Somewhat later,
social philosophers began to see disability as a source both of
discrimination and oppression, and of group identity, akin to race or
sex in these respects.

In some ways, disability looks much like sex or race as a
philosophical topic. It concerns the classification of people on the
basis of observed or inferred characteristics. It raises difficult
threshold questions about the extent to which the classification is
based on biology or is socially constructed. And yet the strong
philosophical interest in some of the characteristics on which the
disability classification is based appears to accord them a
significance that many would deny to the distinguishing
characteristics of sex or race.

Consider, for example, the question of how well-being is affected by
the characteristics on which the disability classification is based.
There is little interest now in the question of whether, in a world
without discrimination, blacks or women would do better or worse on
various metrics of well-being than whites or men. In contrast, there
is considerable interest in this question when the subject is people
with
 disabilities.[1]
 Some philosophers and disability scholars claim that the answer is no
different than in the case of race or sex: to the extent that
disability reduces well-being, it is because of the stigma and
discrimination it evokes. In contrast, other philosophers claim that
disability is fundamentally different from race and gender in that it
necessarily reduces well-being: even in a utopian world of
non-discrimination, people with blindness, deafness or paraplegia
would be worse off than their able-bodied counterparts. This is but
one example of the many ways that disability generates philosophical
debate about some of our most familiar ethical, political, and
epistemological concepts.

This introductory entry will outline the prevailing definitions and
models of disability, and discuss the epistemic and moral authority of
the experiences and self-reports of people classified as disabled.

Feminist Perspectives on Disability,0.4924303889274597,0.8143304586410522,"


Traditional philosophy paid almost no attention to the existence and
experiences of people who are physically or cognitively impaired.
That in the past philosophers only rarely took notice of disability is
understandable, if not condonable. The general culture usually
associates disability with defectiveness, insufficiency, and
imperfection, in other words, with states that philosophy throughout
its history has mainly aimed to transcend or overcome. Traditionally,
philosophers rarely mentioned the kinds of impairments that are
identified with disabling conditions. And when they did mention
disability, their purpose almost always has been to invoke a limiting
case (Silvers et al. 1998, 3), for example, babies so deformed as to
vitiate the value of human life (Kuhse and Singer 1986), or adults too
dependent and noncontributing to be parties to the social
contract (Rawls 1985).


Over the last half century, however, scholarship in many disciplines
has come to appreciate the broader significance of difference. In this
spirit, philosophers began to question the preeminence assigned to
normalcy, and the concomitant devaluation of the physical and
cognitive conditions considered to be disabilities (Canguilhem
1989). Recently, feminist thinkers moved into the forefront of this
turn of interest in disability, sometimes prompted by their
philosophical commitment to inclusiveness, and sometimes by
personal encounters with disability. Disability perspectives have
become familiar in feminist approaches to some philosophical topics,
for instance, ethics and justice theory, and the metaphysics of
embodiment. Feminist approaches to other topics, such as models and
standards of knowing, might also benefit by being enlarged to include
disability perspectives.

"Disability: Health, Well-Being, and Personal Relationships",0.4879775643348694,0.8193174004554749,"

In the past 50 years, there has been burgeoning philosophical interest
in well-being, health, and personal relationships. There has also been
increasing philosophical writing on disability, particularly in
relation to justice and equality. Until recently, however, there has
been little philosophical discussion of disability's relevance to well-being,
health, or personal relationships—in contrast to the growing
scholarship on these topics in the social sciences. Until the past
decade, most philosophical discussions of well-being simply treated
disabilities as conditions that reduced it. Philosophical
accounts of health and disease have mentioned disability, but mainly
to treat it as a form of disease or ill-health; they have had little
to say about the complex, contested relationship between disease and
disability. And with the notable exception of parental attitudes
toward one’s actual or possible disabled children, the role of
disability in personal relationships has provoked scant philosophical
interest.

This Entry will proceed as follows. Part 1 will discuss disability and
well-being. It will begin by reviewing debates on the application of
three standard accounts of well-being to disability. It will note the
divergence between first- and third-person assessments of the impact
of disability on well-being under all these accounts and suggest
some reasons for this divergence. We will then examine what we regard
as the most difficult challenge to the claim that many or most
disabilities do not necessarily reduce well-being: the widely-held
view that it is desirable to prevent, correct, or mitigate
disabilities, and generally undesirable to acquire one. The concluding
section of Part 1 will examine how assumptions about disability and
well-being inform a number of contemporary debates in medicine and
health care.

Part 2 will examine philosophical writing on health and disease. It
will review different definitions of health and their implications for
the question of whether it is necessarily unhealthy to be disabled. It
will consider the few attempts that have been made to distinguish
disability from disease. It will also note a tension for disability
scholars in making the distinction between disease and disability:
although that distinction provides a basis for separating the medical
from the socially constructed aspects of disability, it can also
oversimplify the experience of people with disabilities.

Part 3 will discuss disability and personal relationships. It will
examine widely shared assumptions concerning the impact of
disabilities on a variety of relationships, in particular the doubts
expressed by many laypeople about the capacity of adults with
disabilities to become friends, lovers, and parents. This Part will
also consider how historical and contemporary accounts of friendship
and love apply to persons with disabilities.

After exploring the relevance of disability to well-being, health, and
personal relationships, this Entry will conclude by examining common
features of the philosophical treatment of disability in the three
domains. Philosophical scrutiny is particularly needed in these areas,
because of the strength and persistence of popular assumptions about
the adverse impact of disability on all three.

The impact that disability has on each domain is largely a function of
the view or model of disability one accepts. Disability scholars and
philosophers of disability now refer to two models of disability, the
medical and the social (see
 SEP entry on disability: definitions, models, experience).
 For present purposes, we understand the social model of disability as
holding that the physical and social environment are the primary
source of the limitations and disadvantages faced by people with
almost all impairments. This model has obvious relevance for the
accounts of well-being, health, and personal relationships we will
examine. It suggests that if people with disabilities appear to be
unhappy, unhealthy, or socially isolated, it is primarily due to
contingent features of their physical and social environments, not to
any intrinsic features of their impaired functions. In some cases,
this recognition will require a reassessment of their present
well-being, health, or social relationships. In other cases, it will
not challenge that assessment, but will alter the prescription for
improving their well-being, health, or relationships, or the
expectation of success in doing so.

Disability and Health Care Rationing,0.4848916530609131,0.8324438333511353,"

In the 1990s philosophers, in particular bioethicists, debated the
broad question of the justice of health care resource allocation, and
in particular the ethical pros and cons of the dominant rationing
strategy based on cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) with benefit
characterized in terms of “quality of life”. A dominant
theme in this literature was whether a pre-existing health state, or
resulting health outcome, should be taken into account when allocating
health resources. More specifically, the debate centered on whether a
person’s disability should be taken into account, or whether
doing so would be discriminatory or unfair. As Dan Brock explained it,
this concern was raised because of the confluence of two
events—the then recent (1990) passage of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), prohibiting discrimination on the basis
of disability, and the 1992 Oregon Medicaid proposal for rationing
services, which used both CEA and a quality of life outcome measure to
prioritize treatments for persons with specific health conditions and
which arguably systematically disadvantaged people with pre-existing
disabilities (Brock 1995, 1999, 2004).

The ethics of health care allocation or rationing raises a raft of
issues that are not directly dependent on the potential discriminatory
impact on persons with disabilities. Yet, since it is difficult to
clearly separate the general ethical issues from those raised by the
focus on disability, we begin in Section 1 by surveying, first,
general ethical concerns in health care rationing, and then the
specific issues raised by CEA and quality of life as a metric of the
“benefit” that health care resources provide. We then turn
in Section 2 to review why it has been argued that disability poses a
special set of ethical issues in health care rationing. The ethical
issues of health resource rationing (or “prioritization”
as it is sometimes called) can be exemplified either at the individual
level of specific allocation decisions “at the bedside”,
or more generally as a social policy of health care rationing. The
ethical issues at the individual level are reviewed in Section 2, and
social policy issues are considered in Section 3, including whether it
makes any difference if access to health care is viewed as a human
right. We conclude in Section 4 with the unsatisfactory result that we
remain in a dilemma: refusing to consider disability in health care
allocation seems irrational and unfair, but taking disability into
account raises a range of, apparently, irresolvable philosophical
issues.

Disability and Justice,0.4867728054523468,0.8119204640388489,"


Among the topics in philosophy and disability, justice has received
the lion's share of attention. This is in part because justice,
often regarded as the “first virtue of social
institutions” (Rawls 1971, 3), is central to the evaluation of
social policies and public institutions. But it is also because
disability has been seen by political philosophers and disability
scholars as posing serious challenges to contractarian and
contractualist theories of justice: to theories based on hypothetical
agreement, mutual advantage, or reciprocity.


Disability also presents difficult issues as a social or group identity
– as a central part of the way an individual understands,
presents, or values herself. This aspect of disability has been made
salient by the civil rights movement that established disability as an
important category in antidiscrimination law. Theories that assess
justice in terms of the distribution of resources or opportunities have
been criticized for failing to take adequate account of such
identities. But the embrace of social identity as a component of
justice can be equally problematic.


Disability is of particular interest for justice because of the way
in which it juxtaposes two basic and powerful senses of
injustice: first, the treatment of some people as moral,
social, or political inferiors on the basis of irrelevant
characteristics; second, the creation, perpetuation, or simple failure
to correct disparities between individuals in income, wealth, health,
and other aspects of well-being on the basis of morally irrelevant
factors. These two broad categories of injustice – roughly,
disrespect and distributive inequity – correspond closely to
Nancy Fraser's influential distinction between recognition and
redistribution (1995) as alternative responses to the problem of
injustice. Recognition seeks to secure equal respect for individuals
to whom it has been denied; redistribution seeks to correct unfair
disparities in advantages of various kinds. The relationship and
comparative importance of these two forms of injustice have been the
subject of considerable discussion (Anderson 1999; Fraser 2001, 1996;
Honneth 1992).


This entry is organized as follows: Section 1 will discuss disability
in therms of these two broad types of injustice. Sections 2 and 3 will
examine the implications of different models of disability for the
distinction between redistribution and recognition. Section 4 will
then examine the treatment of disability in contemporary theories of
distributive justice. It will explain how the environmental and social
character of disability has been largely overlooked by contractarian
and egalitarian theories, not so much because of their distributive
focus, but because of their narrow focus on one aspect of disability
– functional limitation – to the neglect of exclusionary
attitudes and practices. Section 4 will conclude by discussing recent
efforts to rectify this neglect, describing several ways in which
distributive justice theorists have sought to take account of
environmental and social barriers and to address claims for
recognition. These efforts include broadening the metric for just
distributions to encompass respectful relationships and social
practices; arguing that a just distribution on such broader metrics
can be attained more effectively and appropriately by modifying the
physical and social environment than by redistributing resources among
individuals; and adopting outcome standards that do not require strict
equality on any metric but rather the reduction or elimination of
disrespectful inequalities. Section 5 will discuss a major issue in
the recognition of disability: the relationship of disability identity
to various approaches to justice, where “identity” is
understood as a part of an individual's self-understanding or
self-presentation.

Disagreement,0.7048676609992981,0.7504870891571045,"


We often find ourselves in disagreement with others. You may think
nuclear energy is so volatile that no nuclear energy plants should be
built anytime soon. But you are aware that there are many people who
disagree with you on that very question. You disagree with your sister
regarding the location of the piano in your childhood home, with you
thinking it was in the primary living area and her thinking it was in
the small den. You and many others believe Jesus Christ rose from the
dead; millions of others disagree.


It seems that awareness of disagreement can, at least in many cases,
supply one with a powerful reason to think that one’s belief is
false. When you learned that your sister thought the piano had been in
the den instead of the living room, you acquired a good reason to
think it really wasn’t in the living room, as you know full well
that your sister is a generally intelligent individual, has the
appropriate background experience (she lived in the house too), and is
about as honest, forthright, and good at remembering events from
childhood as you are. If, in the face of all this, you stick with your
belief that the piano was in the living room, will your retaining that
belief be reasonable?


In the piano case there is probably nothing important riding on the
question of what to do in the face of disagreement. But in many cases
our disagreements are of great weight, both in the public arena and in
our personal lives. You may disagree with your spouse or partner about
whether to live together, whether to get married, where you should
live, or how to raise your children. People with political power
disagree about how to spend enormous amounts of money, or about what
laws to pass, or about wars to fight. If only we were better able to
resolve our disagreements, we would probably save millions of lives
and prevent millions of others from living in poverty.


This article examines the central epistemological issues tied to the
recognition of disagreement.


Compared to many other topics treated in this encyclopedia, the
epistemology of disagreement is a mere infant. While the discussion of
disagreement isn’t altogether absent from the history of
philosophy, philosophers didn’t start, as a group, thinking
about the topic in a rigorous and detailed way until the 21st
century. For that reason, it is difficult to know what the primary
issues and questions are concerning the general topic. At this early
stage of investigation we are just getting our feet wet. In this
essay, we begin by trying to motivate what we think should be the
primary issues and questions before we move on to look at some of the
main ideas in the literature. In so doing we also introduce some new
terminology and make some novel distinctions that we think are helpful
in navigating this relatively recent debate.

Discourse Representation Theory,0.8186538815498352,0.8763304352760315,"
In the early 1980s, Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) was
introduced by Hans Kamp as a theoretical framework for dealing with
issues in the semantics and pragmatics of anaphora and tense (Kamp
1981); a very similar theory was developed independently by Irene Heim
(1982). The distinctive features of DRT, to be discussed below, are
that it is a mentalist and representationalist theory of
interpretation, and that it is a theory of the interpretation not only
of individual sentences but of discourse, as well. In these respects
DRT made a clear break with classical formal semantics, which during
the 1970s had emanated from Montague's pioneering work (Thomason
1974), but in other respects it continued the tradition, e.g., in its
use of model-theoretical tools. In the meantime, DRT has come to serve
as a framework for explaining a wide range of phenomena, but we will
confine our attention to fewer than a handful: anaphora, tense,
presupposition, and propositional attitudes. For references to work on
other topics, see the “Further reading” section.

Discrimination,0.4826790690422058,0.7722331285476685,"


Discrimination is prohibited by six of the core international human
rights documents. The vast majority of the world’s states
have constitutional or statutory provisions outlawing discrimination.
(Osin and Porat 2005) And most philosophical, political, and
legal discussions of discrimination proceed on the premise that
discrimination is morally wrong and, in a wide range of cases, ought to
be legally prohibited. However, co-existing with this impressive
global consensus are many contested questions, suggesting that there is
less agreement about discrimination than initially meets the eye.
What is discrimination? Is it a conceptual truth that discrimination is
wrong, or is it a substantive moral judgment? What is the
relation of discrimination to oppression and exploitation? What
are the categories on which acts of discrimination can be based, aside
from such paradigmatic classifications as race, religion, and sex?
These are some of the contested issues.

Concepts of Disease and Health,0.6738064885139465,0.6918771266937256,"


Health and disease are critical concepts in bioethics with
far-reaching social and political implications. For instance, any
attempt to educate physicians or regulate heath insurance must employ
some standards that can be used to assess whether people are ill or
not. Concepts of health and disease also connect in interesting ways
with issues about function and explanation in philosophy of the
biomedical sciences, and theories of well-being in ethics.

Disjunction,0.8261383175849915,0.7738871574401855,"

In logic, disjunction is a binary connective (\(\vee\)) classically
interpreted as a truth function the output of which is true if at
least one of the input sentences (disjuncts) is true, and false
otherwise. Its supposed connection with disjunctive words of natural
language like or has long intrigued philosophers, logicians
and linguists. In this entry we give an overview of logical and
linguistic analyses of disjunction with focus on developments at the
interface between logic and language. Sections 1 and 2 present
disjunction as a binary connective in classical logic and in a number
of non-classical interpretations. Section 3 discusses some basic facts
concerning disjunctive words in natural language, and introduces a
generalized, cross-categorial notion of disjunction as the
join operator in a (Boolean) algebra. Section 4 and 5 present
Grice’s account of the use of or in conversation and
recent developments in the discussion on inclusive and exclusive uses
of linguistic disjunctive words. Finally, sections 6 and 7 introduce
two recent non-classical accounts of linguistic disjunction and
discuss applications to phenomena of free choice, disjunctive
questions and counterfactuals with disjunctive antecedents.

Dispositions,0.8159006834030151,0.5291758775711061,"

A glass has certain dispositions, for example the
disposition to shatter when struck. But what is this disposition? It
seems on the one hand to be a perfectly real property, a genuine
respect of similarity common to glasses, china cups, and anything else
fragile. Yet on the other hand, the glass’s disposition seems
mysterious, ‘ethereal’ (as Goodman (1954) put it) in a way
that, say, its size and shape are not. For its disposition, it seems,
has to do only with its possibly shattering in
certain conditions. In general, it seems that nothing about
the actual behaviour of an object is ever necessary
for it to have the dispositions it has. Many objects differ from one
another with respect to their dispositions in virtue of their merely
possible behaviours, and this is a mysterious way for objects to
differ.

Much of the recent work on the topic of dispositions has been focused
on attempts to dispel this mystery by explaining dispositions in
other, more readily understandable terms. The topic of dispositions is
interesting in its own right. But it derives further interest from the
fact that appeals to dispositions have been made in just about every
area of philosophy. There are explicitly dispositional analyses, for
example, of mental states, of colours, of value, of properties, and of
conditionals. Philosophers interested in just about anything should be
interested in dispositions.

The Sophists,0.5243455171585083,0.2812440097332001,"


The Greek word sophistēs, formed from the
noun sophia, ‘wisdom’ or ‘learning’,
has the general sense ‘one who exercises wisdom or
learning’. As sophia could designate specific types of
expertise as well as general sagacity in the conduct of life and the
higher kinds of insight associated with seers and poets, the word
originally meant ‘sage’ or ‘expert’. In the
course of the fifth century BCE the term, while retaining its original
unspecific sense, came in addition to be applied specifically to a new
type of intellectuals, professional educators who toured the Greek
world offering instruction in a wide range of subjects, with particular
emphasis on skill in public speaking and the successful conduct of
life. The emergence of this new profession, which was an extension to
new areas of the tradition of the itinerant rhapsode (reciter of poems,
especially of Homer), was a response to various social, economic,
political and cultural developments of the period. The increasing
wealth and intellectual sophistication of Greek cities, especially
Athens, created a demand for higher education beyond the traditional
basic grounding in literacy, arithmetic, music and physical training.
To some extent this involved the popularization of Ionian speculation
about the physical world (see Presocratic Philosophy), which was
extended into areas such as history, geography and the origins of
civilization. The increase in participatory democracy, especially in
Athens, led to a demand for success in political and forensic oratory,
and hence to the development of specialized techniques of persuasion
and argument. Finally, the period saw the flourishing of a challenging,
rationalistic climate of thought on questions including those of
morality, religion and political conduct, to which the sophists both
responded and contributed. It is important to emphasize the
individualistic character of the sophistic profession; its
practitioners belonged to no organization, shared no common body of
beliefs and founded no schools, either in the sense of academic
institutions or in that of bodies of individuals committed to the
promulgation of specific doctrines. In what follows we shall illustrate
the diversity of sophistic activities, while considering the extent to
which we can nevertheless identify common themes and attitudes.

Distributive Justice,0.4704476892948151,0.7290306687355042,"

The economic, political, and social frameworks that each society 
has—its laws, institutions, policies, etc.—result in
different distributions of benefits and burdens across members of the
society. These frameworks are the result of human political processes
and they constantly change both across societies and within societies
over time. The structure of these frameworks is important because the
distributions of benefits and burdens resulting from them
fundamentally affect people’s lives. Arguments about which
frameworks and/or resulting distributions are morally preferable
constitute the topic of distributive justice. Principles of
distributive justice are therefore best thought of as providing moral
guidance for the political processes and structures that affect the
distribution of benefits and burdens in societies, and any principles
which do offer this kind of moral guidance on distribution, regardless
of the terminology they employ, should be considered principles of
distributive justice.

This entry is structured in the following way. After outlining the
scope of the entry and the role of distributive principles, the first
relatively simple principle of distributive justice examined is Strict
Egalitarianism, which calls for the allocation of equal material goods
to all members of society. John Rawls’ alternative distributive
principle, which he calls the Difference Principle, is examined next.
The Difference Principle permits diverging from strict equality so
long as the inequalities in question would make the least advantaged
in society materially better off than they would be under strict
equality. Some have thought that neither strict equality nor
Rawls’ Difference Principle capture the important moral roles of
luck and responsibility. The “Luck Egalitarianism”
literature comprises varying attempts to design distributive
principles that are appropriately sensitive to considerations of
responsibility and luck. Desert-based principles similarly emphasize
the moral roles of responsibility and luck but are distinct because
they approach these factors through claims about what people deserve
because of their work.

Advocates of welfare-based principles (of which utilitarianism is the
most famous) do not believe the primary distributive concern should be
material goods and services. They argue that material goods and
services have no intrinsic value but are valuable only in so far as
they increase welfare. Hence, they argue, distributive principles
should be designed and assessed according to how they affect welfare,
either its maximization or distribution. Advocates of libertarian
principles, by contrast to each of the principles so far mentioned,
generally criticize any distributive ideal that requires the pursuit
of specific ‘patterns’, such as maximization or equality
of welfare or of material goods. They argue that the pursuit of such
patterns conflicts with the more important moral demands of liberty or
self-ownership. Finally, feminist critiques of existing distributive
principles note that they tend to ignore the particular circumstances
of women, so feminists tend to argue for principles which are more
sensitive to facts such as that women often have primary
responsibility for child-rearing and on average, spend less of their
lifetimes than men in the market economy.

Distributive Justice and Empirical Moral Psychology,0.5586258172988892,0.7277663946151733,"
Whether and to what extent people are motivated by considerations
of justice is a central topic in a number of fields including
economics, psychology, and business. The implications of this topic
extend broadly, from the psychology of negotiations, to the motives
citizens have to pay taxes, to what considerations influence
healthcare allocation decisions. Given all the possible topics which
could be explored, this essay adopts the following parameters to help
narrow the focus:

We will look at the moral psychology of individuals as opposed to
firms, societies, or other collective entities.
Our focus will be on empirical results, rather than armchair
considerations of what the psychology of people might be like or what
it should be like. The SEP entry on the virtue of justice discusses
the moral psychology of a just person (Slote 2014). But whether people
actually are motivated by justice or have the virtue of justice is an
empirical question.
The kind of justice that will be our focus here is distributive
justice, rather than retributive, international, transitional, or
other kinds.

More specifically, we will examine the distributive motives and
behavior of individuals by consulting the empirical literature on
economic games. Other topics, including the relationship between
empirical results and specific theories of distributive justice such
as John Rawls’s or Robert Nozick’s, will have to be
addressed on another occasion (Lamont and Favor 2014).
Why economic games? The psychologists Kun Zhao and Like Smillie
provide a nice answer:
  Economic games have become widely adopted within the
psychological sciences, where they are used to model complex social
interactions and allow for rigorous empirical investigations. As
behavioral paradigms, they are well-controlled, manipulable, and
replicable…making them ideal for bridging the gap between
theory and naturalistic data.  In personality research, they provide
behavioral paradigms that may complement and help validate self-report
measures, and offer sharp operationalizations of somewhat slippery
concepts. (2015: 277–278, see also Fetchenhauer and Huang 2004:
1018)
There are two general kinds of economic games. Social
dilemmas typically juxtapose short-term self-interest with
long-term group interests, and include the prisoner’s dilemma
and the public goods game. Bargaining games typically involve
two players distributing a specific payoff (usually money), and will
be our focus here, as they are especially helpful for examining the
moral psychology of justice. Examples include the ultimatum game and
dictator game. We will also look at a novel twist on the dictator game
by the psychologist Daniel Batson, which has fostered a large
experimental literature on what he calls “moral
hypocrisy”. Finally we will connect this discussion of economic
games to the virtue of justice and to other personality traits such as
agreeableness, honesty-humility, and justice sensitivity.
Before diving in, it is worth saying something very briefly about
why empirical results might be of interest to philosophers as they
theorize about distributive justice. One might think, after all, that
philosophers tend to focus less on what people actually tend to do and
be like, as opposed to what they should do and be like. Nevertheless,
in recent years philosophers in general have paid increasing attention
to empirical research, and with respective to matters of distributive
justice, a few important reasons for doing so are the following:

Ethical egoism claims that a person’s central goal ought to
be the promotion of his or her long-term self-interest.  Most
philosophers reject ethical egoism. But is it psychologically
realistic to expect most people to act on motives other than
self-interested ones, such as motives of fairness and justice?
Empirical results, such as those reviewed in the first three sections
of this article, would bear on this question.
Relatedly, moral philosophers have developed rich conceptions of
the virtue of justice and what a just person who do. But are these
conceptions empirically adequate and psychologically realistic for
human beings like us? Empirical results would bear on this question,
and if the answer is no, then perhaps those conceptions are
problematized (Doris 2002; Miller 2014).
Philosophers might come up with normative criteria for when
actions and institutions are just or not. But to actually apply those
criteria to real world concerns, they need empirical data about how
people and institutions are in fact behaving.
Empirical data is also highly relevant to philosophers interested
in developing strategies for improvement, so that just actions, just
institutions, and just character are increasingly promoted.

International Distributive Justice,0.4504180550575256,0.7002038359642029,"


International distributive justice has become a prominent
topic within political philosophy. Philosophers have, of course,
long been concerned with the wealth and poverty, and how the
inequalities between persons might be justified. They have,
however, tended to focus only upon inequalities between inhabitants of
the same state. In recent years, though, a sustained
philosophical dialogue has emerged on how these ideas might be applied
to the relationships and institutions holding at the global
level. This dialogue has been prompted by issues of philosophy,
but also by the realities of globalization and global poverty; in a
world as connected as our own, is it justifiable that some have so much
while others have so little? 


This entry is an introduction to the recent development of this
dialogue. It is, perhaps, appropriate to start with some
limitations. This entry will discuss only the distributive
aspects of international justice, rather than on all aspects of
international relations and institutions that might be morally
important. Philosophical discussion of global justice has become
sufficiently rich and complex that it is no longer possible to discuss
all the various threads of this discussion in one entry (see Chatterjee
(2011) for a more encyclopedic discussion of the various debates within
global justice). This entry will, accordingly, leave to one side
such important topics as fairness in trade (James 2012; Wenar 2009;
Kurjanska and Risse 2008); immigration (Wellman and Cole 2011;
Carens 1995); and gender (Kristof and WuDunn 2010; Jaggar 2005;
Nussbaum 2001). The fact that we do not discuss these topics
should not be read as implying their irrelevance; on the contrary, they
are enormously important for any adequate theory of global justice, and
deserve more attention than we can provide here. This entry will,
moreover, discuss writings primarily within the tradition of liberal
egalitarianism. Thinkers of a radical or a Marxist bent have had
things to say about international justice, too, but these writings are
here largely ignored (see Kohn, Humphrey, and Goto-Jones in Bell 2010,
for discussions of these topics.) The entry is, finally, focused
almost exclusively on fairly recent writings. The reason for this
is the simple fact, noted above, that international justice has been a
central research topic only in recent years. This is emphatically
not to say that less recent philosophers have not had important things
to say about international justice: Immanuel Kant's idea of a
foedus pacificum continues to exert a strong
influence over modern philosophical thought, for example, as does
Mill's liberal nationalism (Kant, 1795; Mill, 1859.) The
modern period, too, has seen some sustained discussion of global wealth
and poverty, most notably in Peter Singer's discussion of the
ethics of global famine relief (Singer 1972; see also Singer
2002). Nevertheless, the modern dialogue about international
distributive justice can be largely traced to the initial publication
of John Rawls's A Theory of Justice in 1971, and the
prehistory of these ideas can be largely omitted in the present
context.

Religious Diversity (Pluralism),0.6665195226669312,0.5914613604545593,"


With respect to many, if not most issues, there exist significant
differences of opinion among individuals who seem to be equally
knowledgeable and sincere. Individuals who apparently have access to
the same information and are equally interested in the truth affirm
incompatible perspectives on, for instance, significant social,
political, and economic issues. Such diversity of opinion, though, is
nowhere more evident than in the area of religious thought. On almost
every religious issue, honest, knowledgeable people hold significantly
diverse, often incompatible beliefs.


Religious diversity of this sort can fruitfully be explored in many
ways—for instance, from psychological, anthropological, or
historical perspectives. The current discussion, however, will concern
itself primarily with those key issues surrounding religious diversity
with which philosophers, especially analytic philosophers of religion,
are most concerned at present. Specifically, our discussion will focus
primarily on the following questions: How pervasive is religious
diversity? Does the reality of this diversity require a response? Can
a person who acknowledges religious diversity remain justified in
claiming just one perspective to be correct? If so, is it morally
justifiable to attempt to convert others to a different perspective?
Can it justifiably be claimed that only one religion offers a path
into the eternal presence of God? How should religious diversity be
approached in public education? The answers to such questions are not
simply academic. They increasingly have great impact on how we treat
others, both personally and corporately.

Theological Voluntarism,0.5381775498390198,0.6402049660682678,"


There is a class of metaethical and normative views that commonly
goes by the name ‘divine command theory.’ What all members
of this class have in common is that they hold that what God wills is
relevant to determining the moral status of some set of entities
(acts, states of affairs, character traits, etc., or some combination
of these). But the name ‘divine command theory’ is a bit
misleading: what these views have in common is their appeal to the
divine will; while many of these views hold that the relevant act of
divine will is that of commanding, some deny it. So we would do well
to have a label for this class of views that does not prejudge the
issue of the relevant act of divine will. The label that I will use,
following Quinn 1990, is ‘theological voluntarism.’

 I have three aims in this article. I want first to distinguish
metaethical versions of theological voluntarism from normative
versions of that view, putting to the side normative versions. Second,
I will say something about the main lines of defense of theological
voluntarism, the various theoretical options that confront defenders
of theological voluntarism, and some of the reasons for affirming or
rejecting these different possible formulations. And finally I will
say a bit about the sort of difficulties that seem to confront any
such views. (I do not, however, give an account of the history of
theological voluntarism in moral philosophy; for an anthology of
readings covering a broad swath of this history, see Idziak 1979.)

Concepts of God,0.6964911222457886,0.5640811324119568,"


The object of attitudes valorized in the major religious traditions is
typically regarded as maximally great. Conceptions of maximal
greatness differ but theists believe that a maximally great reality
must be a maximally great person or God. Theists largely
agree that a maximally great person would be omnipresent, omnipotent,
omniscient, and all good. They do not agree on a number of God's other
attributes, however. We will illustrate this by examining the debate
over God's impassibility in western theism and a dispute over God's
relation to the space-time world in Indian theism. The entry concludes
by examining some concepts of limited deities.

Foreknowledge and Free Will,0.7223904132843018,0.6171665787696838,"


Fatalism is the thesis that human acts occur by necessity and hence
are unfree. Theological fatalism is the thesis that infallible
foreknowledge of a human act makes the act necessary and hence unfree.
If there is a being who knows the entire future infallibly, then no
human act is free.


Fatalism seems to be entailed by infallible foreknowledge by the
following informal line of reasoning:
For any future act you will perform, if some being
infallibly believed in the past that the act would occur, there is
nothing you can do now about the fact that he believed what he
believed since nobody has any control over past events; nor can you
make him mistaken in his belief, given that he is
infallible. Therefore, there is nothing you can do now about the fact
that he believed in a way that cannot be mistaken that you would do
what you will do. But if so, you cannot do otherwise than what he
believed you would do. And if you cannot do otherwise, you will not
perform the act freely.


The same argument can be applied to any infallibly foreknown act of
any human being. If there is a being who infallibly knows everything
that will happen in the future, no human being has any control over
the future.


This theological fatalist argument creates a dilemma because
many people have thought it important to maintain both (1) there is a
deity who infallibly knows the entire future, and (2) human beings
have free will in the strong sense usually called libertarian.  But
the theological fatalist argument seems to show that (1) and (2) are
incompatible; the only way consistently to accept (2) is to deny
(1). Those philosophers who think there is a way to consistently
maintain both (1) and (2) are called compatibilists about infallible
foreknowledge and human free will. Compatibilists must either identify
a false premise in the argument for theological fatalism or show that
the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Incompatibilists
accept the incompatibility of infallible foreknowledge and human free
will and deny either infallible foreknowledge or free will in the
sense targeted by the argument.

Divine Freedom,0.5786510109901428,0.6083531975746155,"


The topic of divine freedom concerns the extent to which a divine
being — in particular, the supreme divine being, God — can
be free.  Two preliminary questions play a central role in framing the
discussion of divine freedom. I: Apart from freedom, what properties
are held to be essential to God? II: What conception(s) of freedom
govern the inquiry? Discussions of divine freedom typically concern
the traditional conception of God as a being who is essentially
omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and eternal. With respect to
the second question, there are two conceptions of freedom common in
philosophical discussion: the compatibilist conception and the
libertarian conception. The topic of divine freedom concerns the
question of whether God, as traditionally conceived, can enjoy
whatever sort and degree of freedom required for moral responsibility,
thankfulness, and praise. But when it is asked, “Can God be
Free?” it is important to specify what it is about which God
might be thought to act freely. Since God is essentially omnipotent,
omniscient, perfectly good, and eternal, it is clear that God is not
free to weaken himself, to become ignorant, to do something evil, or
to destroy himself. But it does seem important that God be free with
respect to bringing about any one of a number of possible worlds, as
well as free to bring about no world at all. What if, however, among
possible worlds there is one that is the best? Is God then free to
create any world other than the best?  This question has been a center
of controversy for centuries. In considering this question and others
it will be helpful to consider the views of some important
philosophers who have contributed significantly to the literature on
the topic of divine freedom. The philosophers whose views will be
considered most fully are Leibniz and Samuel Clarke. These two are
particularly important because, in addition to being very able
philosophers, they engaged each other in the controversy between the
compatibilist's and the libertarian view of freedom. In the justly
famous Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, Leibniz championed
compatibilism, while Clarke represented the libertarian cause. In
addition to Leibniz and Clarke, some important 20th century
contributions on this topic by Thomas Morris and Robert Adams will
also be discussed.

Hiddenness of God,0.6751661896705627,0.6137946248054504,"

“Divine hiddenness”, as the phrase suggests, refers, most
fundamentally, to the hiddenness of God, i.e., the alleged fact that
God is hidden, absent, silent. In religious literature, there is a
long history of expressions of annoyance, anxiety, and despair over
divine hiddenness, so understood. For example, ancient Hebrew texts
lament God’s failure to show up in experience or to show proper
regard for God’s people or some particular person, and two
Christian Gospels portray Jesus, in his cry of dereliction on the
cross, as experiencing abandonment by God, whom he regarded as
“Abba, Father”, an experience shared by many mystics,
saints, and ordinary folk of all theistic traditions, described at its
worst as “the dark night of the soul”. Understood in this
way, divine hiddenness poses an existential problem for those who have
such experiences.

However, “divine hiddenness” refers to something else in
recent philosophical literature, especially since the publication of
J.L. Schellenberg’s landmark book, Divine Hiddenness and
Human Reason (1993). In this context, it refers to alleged facts
about the absence of belief of God, on the basis of which one might
think there is no God. For example, Schellenberg argues that, since
there are nonbelievers who are capable of a personal relationship with
God and who do not resist it, there is no perfectly loving God, while
Stephen Maitzen argues that naturalism better explains the
“demographics” of nonbelief than theism and Jason Marsh
argues that naturalism better explains “natural nonbelief”
than theism. Understood in this way, divine hiddenness constitutes
putative evidence for atheism.

Although some of the recent philosophical literature addresses the
problem understood in the first way (e.g., DeWeese-Boyd 2016; Garcia
2002), this entry focuses on divine hiddenness understood in the
second way. The first section discusses the relationships between
nonbelief and another source of alleged evidence for atheism: evil.
The second section states and defends the argument from nonresistant
nonbelief. The third section sketches attempts to explain nonresistant
nonbelief from a theistic perspective. The fourth section states other
responses to the argument from nonresistant nonbelief. The fifth
section discusses the argument from the demographics of nonbelief and
the sixth section discusses the argument from natural nonbelief.

Divine Illumination,0.676678478717804,0.21456167101860046,"


Divine illumination is the oldest and most influential alternative to
naturalism in the areas of mind and knowledge. The doctrine holds that
human beings require a special divine assistance in their ordinary
cognitive activities. Although most closely associated with Augustine
and his scholastic followers, the doctrine has its origins in the

Divine Providence,0.6871435046195984,0.5964174866676331,"

Traditional theism holds that God is the creator of heaven and earth,
and that all that occurs in the universe takes place under Divine
Providence — that is, under God’s sovereign guidance
and control. According to believers, God governs creation as a loving
father, working all things for good. Moreover, it is said, God is an
absolutely perfect being. He is, first of all, omniscient or
all-knowing: he knows of all truths that they are true, and of all
falsehoods that they are false, whether they pertain to past, present
or future. And God’s knowledge does not change. Nothing is
learned or forgotten with him; what he knows, he knows from eternity
and infallibly. Second, God is omnipotent or all-powerful: anything
that is logically possible, he can do. Finally, God is perfectly good:
in all circumstances he acts for the best, intending the best possible
outcome. Given these suppositions, our initial expectation would be
that all of creation, animate and inanimate, is ordained to perfect
good: that as creator God pitches his efforts, which none can resist,
toward accomplishing the greatest good imaginable, and hence that the
world in which we find ourselves is, as Leibniz put it, the best of
all possible worlds. But alas, the evidence is otherwise. The world
may contain much good, but it is also a place of suffering,
destruction, and death. Life is brief, and afflicted with sorrows of
every kind—as often as not with no discernible purpose at all,
much less a good one. And it ends for each of us in personal
destruction—in death, which trumps all worldly hopes, and
conceals impenetrably any experience that may lie beyond. Nor are
these mere human hardships. Every living thing dies, all that is
beautiful perishes, everything nature builds is destroyed. Indeed, on
one scientific account of the end of things not an atom, not a photon
will escape the cauldron of the universe’s final collapse. And
that is not all. In human affairs there is the additional evil of sin:
the willful wrongdoing of which we all are at times victims and at
other times perpetrators. How can all of this be, if God’s
nature is as tradition postulates?

Divine Simplicity,0.7647107243537903,0.5660216808319092,"


According to the classical theism of Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas and
their adherents, God is radically unlike creatures in that he is
devoid of any complexity or composition, whether physical or
metaphysical.  Besides lacking spatial and temporal parts, God is free
of matter-form composition, potency-act composition, and
existence-essence composition. There is also no real distinction
between God as subject of his attributes and his attributes. God is
thus in a sense requiring clarification identical to each of
his attributes, which implies that each attribute is identical to
every other one. God is omniscient, then, not in virtue of
instantiating or exemplifying omniscience — which would imply a
real distinction between God and the property of omniscience —
but by being omniscience. And the same holds for each of the
divine omni-attributes: God is what he has as
Augustine puts it in The City of God, XI, 10.  As identical
to each of his attributes, God is identical to his nature.  And since
his nature or essence is identical to his existence, God is identical
to his existence. This is the doctrine of divine simplicity (DDS). It
is represented not only in classical Christian theology, but also in
Jewish, Greek, and Islamic thought.  It is to be understood as an
affirmation of God's absolute transcendence of creatures. God is not
only radically non-anthropomorphic, but radically non-creaturomorphic,
not only in respect of the properties he possesses, but in his manner
of possessing them. The simple God, we could say, differs in his very
ontology from any and all created beings.

Doing vs. Allowing Harm,0.5348687171936035,0.8113631010055542,"

Is there a moral difference between doing harm and
 merely[1]
 allowing harm? If not, there should be no moral objection to active
euthanasia in circumstances where passive euthanasia is permissible;
and there should be no objection to bombing innocent civilians where
doing so will minimize the overall number of deaths in war. There
should, however, be an objection—indeed, an outcry—at our
failure to prevent the deaths of millions of children in the third
world from malnutrition, dehydration, and
 measles.[2]
 Moreover, it seems that the question is pertinent to whether
consequentialism is true, as consequentialists believe that doing harm
is no worse than merely allowing harm while anti-consequentialists,
almost universally, disagree. But is there a moral difference between
doing harm and merely allowing harm? We might divide approaches to
this question into two broad kinds. First, those that attempt to
answer it without saying anything about the nature of the distinction
either by use of examples (‘the contrast strategy.’) or by
appealing to considerations that are purportedly independent of the
precise nature of distinction. And, second, those that analyze the
distinction in depth and try to show that its underlying nature
dictates an answer to the moral question.

Marriage and Domestic Partnership,0.445388525724411,0.7655948996543884,"


Marriage, a prominent institution regulating sex, reproduction, and
family life, is a route into classical philosophical issues such as
the good and the scope of individual choice, as well as itself raising
distinctive philosophical questions. Political philosophers have taken
the organization of sex and reproduction to be essential to the health
of the state, and moral philosophers have debated whether marriage has
a special moral status and relation to the human good. Philosophers
have also disputed the underlying moral and legal rationales for the
structure of marriage, with implications for questions such as the
content of its moral obligations and the legal recognition of same-sex
marriage. Feminist philosophers have seen marriage as playing a
crucial role in women's oppression and thus a central topic of
justice.  In this area philosophy courts public debate: in 1940,
Bertrand Russell's appointment to an academic post was withdrawn on
the grounds that the liberal views expressed in Marriage and
Morals made him morally unfit for such a post. Today, debate over
same-sex marriage is highly charged. Unlike some contemporary issues
sparking such wide interest, there is a long tradition of
philosophical thought on marriage.


Philosophical debate concerning marriage extends to what marriage,
fundamentally, is; therefore, Section 1 examines its definition.
Section 2 sets out the historical development of the philosophy of
marriage, which shapes today's debates. Many of the ethical
positions on marriage can be understood as divided on the question of
whether marriage should be defined contractually by the spouses or by
its institutional purpose, and they further divide on whether that
purpose necessarily includes procreation or may be limited to the
marital love relationship. Section 3 taxonomizes ethical views of
marriage accordingly. Section 4 will examine rival political
understandings of marriage law and its rationale. Discussion of
marriage has played a central role in feminist philosophy; Section 5
will outline the foremost critiques of the institution.

The Donation and Sale of Human Eggs and Sperm,0.5074333548545837,0.8156185150146484,"

The donation and transfer of human gametes (eggs and sperm) for
reproductive purposes raises many important and difficult questions.
Some of these relate directly to policy and practice; others are more
conceptual. Gamete donation occupies an interesting position within
bioethics, having something in common both with other forms of
donation (blood and organs, for example) and with
reproductive technologies not involving donation (ranging
from IVF through to more controversial areas like cloning, embryo
selection, and genetic modification). It also shares some features
with adoption and surrogacy, practices which also
(arguably at least) involve the transfer or delegation of parental
duties and rights. (See entries on
 cloning,
 eugenics,
 feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,
 the donation of human organs, and
 parenthood and procreation.)

Conceptually, gamete donation provides a valuable ‘lens’
through which to re-examine questions such as:

What grounds parental rights and responsibilities?
What rights and obligations do parents have regarding their
children (actual or future) and to what extent can these be
transferred or delegated?


It also raises questions in practical ethics and policy, such as:

Should there be donor offspring limits (to prevent the same sperm
donor having hundreds of biological children)? And, if so, what is the
basis for these?
Do donor-conceived children have a right to know about their
origins? Should donor anonymity be permitted?
What ‘matching’ and selection decisions should the
prospective recipients be allowed to make? What information about
donors should they be given?
Is it acceptable to ‘buy and sell’ gametes? And is
that any different morally from arrangements in which women are
offered heavily discounted fertility treatment services in return for
some of their eggs?


Such questions are the subject of this entry.

Before proceeding, however, two matters of definition and scope should
be noted.

First, this entry focuses on the donation of human gametes for
reproductive purposes, as opposed to for research. The rationale
for this is that most of the interesting ethical and philosophical
issues here concern, in one way or another, the moral and social
relations between the donors, parents (recipients), and children
created, and these do not generally arise in the research context. The
main exception to this is
 section 4 (Payment)
 where similar questions of consent, exploitation, and harm have been
raised in both research and treatment contexts (Baylis & McLeod
2007).

Second, there is the question of what counts as (reproductive) gamete
donation. At least for the purposes of this entry, we intend the term
‘gamete donation’ to apply to those situations in which
–

 A (the donor) voluntarily provides B (the recipient
or recipients) with gametes (paid or otherwise); and
 A expects that and/or intends that B will use those
gametes to create C (a child or some children);
and
 Both A and B expect that and/or intend that
A will not become a social or legal parent of
C.

The Donation of Human Organs,0.5030704140663147,0.8646930456161499,"

Organ transplantation raises difficult ethical questions about
people’s claims to determine what happens to their bodies before
and after death. What are these claims? What would it be to respect
them? How should they fit with the claims of organ donors’
families or the needs of people whose own organs have failed? And then
how should organs be allocated? Who should get priority and why? As
with other topics in applied ethics, satisfactory answers require
knowing the relevant facts, in this case about organ
transplantation.

In summary form, the following empirical claims about organ
transplantation are widely accepted:

Organ transplantation is a successful treatment for organ failure
in many cases.
Organ transplantation is cost-effective (Machnicki et al.
2006).
Most organ transplantation nowadays is routine, not experimental
(Tilney 2003; Veatch and Ross 2015). The organs in question are the
kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, and intestine. This entry
discusses only the “routine” cases. Experimental ones
raise additional questions, but these are more properly dealt with as
part of the entry on
 the ethics of clinical research.
 Present examples of experimental transplantation include faces and
uteri (Catsanos, Rogers, and Lotz 2013; Freeman and Jaoudé
2007; Wilkinson and Williams 2015).
Transplant organs are often scarce. Many people who would benefit
from receiving a transplant do not get one.


Organs are taken from the dead and the living. Each category raises
separate problems and we begin with dead organ donors.

Double Consciousness,0.4375087618827821,0.5480120778083801,"

Double-consciousness is a concept in social philosophy
referring, originally, to a source of inward “twoness”
putatively experienced by African-Americans because of their
racialized oppression and disvaluation in a white-dominated society.
The concept is often associated with William Edward Burghardt Du Bois,
who introduced the term into social and political thought, famously,
in his groundbreaking The Souls of Black Folk (1903). Its
source has been traced back from there, by recent writers, to the
development of clinical psychology in the nineteenth-century North
Atlantic, and to trends in idealist philosophies of self—to the
transcendentalism of Ralph Waldo Emerson and G.W.F. Hegel’s
Phenomenology of Spirit. It is thus indirectly related to
other nineteenth- and twentieth-century riffs on Hegelian themes, such
as false consciousness and bad faith. In our day it continues to be
used and discussed by numerous commentators—philosophical and
otherwise—on racialized cultures, societies, and literatures, by
cultural and literary theorists, and by students and investigators of
Africana Philosophy. Recent philosophical debates center on the
significance of the concept for Du Bois’s thought overall, its
theoretical coherence, and its relevance for current social
conditions.

Frederick Douglass,0.4418503344058991,0.55819171667099,"

Frederick Douglass (c. 1817–1895) is a central figure in United
States and African American
 history.[1]
 He was born a slave, circa
 1817;[2]
 his mother was a Negro slave and his father was reputed to be his
white master. Douglass escaped from slavery in 1838 and rose to become
a principal leader and spokesperson for the U.S. Abolition movement.
He would eventually develop into a towering figure for the U.S. Civil
Rights Movement, and his legacy would be claimed by a diverse span of
groups, from liberals and integrationists to conservatives to
nationalists, within and without black America.

He wrote three autobiographies, each one expanding on the details of
his life. The first was Narrative of the Life of Frederick
Douglass, an American Slave, Written By Himself (in
 1845);[3]
 the second was My Bondage and My Freedom (in 1852a; FDAB:
 103–452);[4]
 and the third was Life and Times of Frederick Douglass (in
1881; FDAB: 453–1045). They are now foremost examples of the
American slave narrative. In addition to being autobiographical, they
are also, as is standard, explicitly works of political and social
criticism and moral suasion; they were aimed at the hearts and minds
of the readers, and their greater purpose was to attack and to
contribute to the abolition of slavery in the United States, and to
argue for the full inclusion of black Americans into the nation.

Shortly after escaping from slavery, Douglass began operating as a
spokesperson, giving numerous speeches about his life and experiences,
for William Lloyd Garrison’s American Anti-Slavery Society. To
spread his story and assist the abolitionist cause, as well as to
counter early charges that someone so eloquent as he could not have
been a slave, Douglass wrote and published his first autobiography,
the Narrative. The Narrative brought Douglass fame
in the United States and the United Kingdom, and it provided the funds
to purchase his freedom.

After breaking with Garrison, Douglass founded and edited his first
paper, the North Star, and authored a considerable body of
letters, editorials, and speeches. These writings have been collected
in Philip Foner’s multivolume, The Life and Writings of
Frederick Douglass (1950–1975, hereafter
 FDLW),[5]
 and in John W. Blassingame and John R. McKivigan’s multivolume,
The Frederick Douglass Papers (1979–, hereafter FDP).


Douglass’s life, from slavery to statesman, his writings and
speeches, and his national and international work have inspired many
lines of discussion in debate within the fields of American and
African American history, political science and theory, sociology, and
in philosophy. His legacy is claimed, despite his links to ideas of
cultural and racial assimilationism, by black Nationalists as well as
by black liberals and black conservatives.

Douglass can be linked to the history of American philosophy, through
his participation in national discussions about the nature of and
future of the American Republic and its institutions. In that light he
is linked to his contemporaries who had academic philosophic
connections, in particular Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882), and
by the uptake of his political and social legacy and writings by later
African American philosophers, such as W.E.B. Du Bois
(1868–1963) and Alain Locke (1884–1954; see Harris 1989).
Frederick Douglass: A Critical Reader, edited by Bill E.
Lawson and Frank M. Kirkland (1999), is a valuable guide to lines of
inquiry about Douglass, and the debates he inspired, within philosophy
in the United States. In contemporary philosophy in the United States,
Douglass’s work is usually taken up within American philosophy,
African American philosophy, and moral, social, and political
philosophy; in particular, the debates in those areas focus on his
views concerning slavery and (later in his career at the dawn of Jim
Crow segregation) racial exploitation and segregation, natural law,
the U.S. constitution, violence and self-respect in the resistance
against slavery, racial integration versus emigration or separation,
cultural assimilation, racial amalgamation, and women’s
suffrage.

Dreams and Dreaming,0.6824027895927429,0.35617682337760925,"
Dreams and dreaming have been topics of philosophical inquiry
since antiquity. Historically, the topic of dreaming has mostly been
discussed in the context of external world skepticism. As famously
suggested by Descartes, dreams pose a threat towards knowledge because
it seems impossible to rule out, at any given moment, that one is now
dreaming. Since the 20th century, philosophical interest in
dreaming has increasingly shifted towards questions related to
philosophy of mind. What exactly does it mean to say that dreams are
conscious experiences during sleep? Do dreams have duration, or are
they the product of instantaneous memory insertion at the moment of
awakening? Should dreams be described as hallucinations or illusions
occurring in sleep, or should they rather be described as imaginative
experiences? Do dreams involve real beliefs? And what is the
relationship between dreaming and self-consciousness?
This entry provides an overview of the main themes in the
philosophical discussion on sleep and dreaming and emphasizes the
connection between issues from different areas of philosophy. Because
recent philosophical work on dreaming has taken on a distinctly
interdisciplinary flavor, this entry also includes pointers to the
relevant scientific literature and gives several examples of how
evidence from scientific sleep and dream research has informed the
philosophical debate, and vice versa.

Dualism,0.7763895988464355,0.4747670888900757,"


This entry concerns dualism in the philosophy of mind. The term
‘dualism’ has a variety of uses in the history of
thought. In general, the idea is that, for some particular domain,
there are two fundamental kinds or categories of things or
principles. In theology, for example a ‘dualist’ is
someone who believes that Good and Evil—or God and the 
Devil—are independent and more or less equal forces in the
world. Dualism contrasts with monism, which is the theory that there
is only one fundamental kind, category of thing or principle; and,
rather less commonly, with pluralism, which is the view that there are
many kinds or categories.  In the philosophy of mind, dualism is the
theory that the mental and the physical—or mind and body or
mind and brain—are, in some sense, radically different kinds
of thing. Because common sense tells us that there are physical
bodies, and because there is intellectual pressure towards producing a
unified view of the world, one could say that materialist monism is
the ‘default option’. Discussion about dualism, therefore,
tends to start from the assumption of the reality of the physical
world, and then to consider arguments for why the mind cannot be
treated as simply part of that world.

William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868–1963) believed that his life
acquired its only deep significance through its participation in what
he called “the Negro problem,” or, later, “the race
problem.” Whether that is true or not, it is difficult to
think of anyone, at any time, who examined the race problem in
its many aspects more profoundly, extensively, and subtly than W.E.B.
Du Bois. Du Bois was an activist and a journalist, a historian
and a sociologist, a novelist, a critic, and a philosopher—but it
is the race problem that unifies his work in these many
domains. 


Du Bois contributes to our specifically philosophical understanding
of race and the race problem, because he treats these themes as objects
of philosophical consideration—indeed, it is largely through an
engagement with Du Bois’s work that many contemporary
philosophers have come to appreciate race and race-related concerns as
fruitful topics of philosophical reflection. Through his work in social
philosophy, political philosophy, and the philosophy of art, Du Bois,
for all intents and purposes, invented the field of philosophy and
race, thereby unsettling and revising our views of the proper scope and
aims of philosophical inquiry.

Dynamic Semantics,0.8331508040428162,0.8146992325782776,"

Dynamic semantics is a perspective on natural language semantics that
emphasizes the growth of information in time. It is an approach to
meaning representation where pieces of text or discourse are viewed as
instructions to update an existing context with new information, the
result of which is an updated context. In a slogan: meaning is context
change potential. 

It is important to be aware of the abstractness of this perspective so
as to guard against various non sequiturs. For one thing, one could
easily think that dynamic semantics or update semantics is committed
at least in part to an internalist idea of semantics since the
information states are “internal”—in the sense that
they are wholly contained in the individual mind/brain. In other
words, one might think that the information states of dynamic
semantics are what Putnam (1975) calls “states in the sense of
methodological solipsism”. See the entries on
 scientific realism,
 computational theory of mind,
 externalism about mental content,
 and
 narrow mental content.
 However, the general framework says nothing about what the states
are. The state could very well include the environment in which the
interpreter is embedded and thus contain an “external”
component.

A second possible misunderstanding is that dynamic semantics or update
semantics is in complete opposition to classical truth conditional
semantics (compare the entries on
 classical logic
 and
 first-order model theory).
 In fact, as this entry will soon make clear, what dynamic semantics
provides is a generalization of truth conditional semantics rather
than a radically different alternative. The classical meanings become
the preconditions for success of the discourse actions.
Dynamic semanticists claim that compositional meanings have
the nature of functions or relations and the classical meanings are
recoverable from the relational dynamic meanings as
projections onto their “input” coordinate.

The point of the use of an abstract framework is not to give empirical
predictions. This is the task of specific realizations inside the
framework. The framework of dynamic semantics (i) provides a direction
of thinking and (ii) allows us to import methods from the mathematical
study of the framework. It follows that the question whether natural
language meaning is intrinsically dynamic does not have an empirical
answer. Still, what can be said is that the study of interpretation as
a linearly-ordered process has proven quite fruitful and
rewarding.

Since dynamic semantics focuses on the discourse actions of sender and
receiver, it is in a sense close to use-oriented approaches to meaning
in philosophy such as the work of Wittgenstein and Dummett. However,
easy identifications between dynamic semantics and these approaches
are to be avoided. Dynamic semantics as an abstract framework is
compatible with many philosophical ways of viewing meaning and
interpretation. Dynamic semantics aims to model meaning and
interpretation. You can do that without answering broader
philosophical questions such as the question of what it is that makes
it possible for the subject to be related to these meanings at all.
For example, in dynamic predicate logic we take the meaning of
horse as given without making any substantial claim about
what it means for a subject to have the concept of horse; we
just stipulate the subject has it. This is not to say such
questions—which are at the center of the work of Wittgenstein
and Dummett—should not ultimately be answered: it’s just
that a model can be of interest even if it does not answer them. (Note
that dynamic semantics tries to give a systematic and compositional
account of meaning, which makes it markedly different in spirit from
Wittgenstein’s later philosophy.)

One approach to dynamic semantics is
 discourse representation theory
 (DRT, Kamp 1981). (Closely related to Kamp’s approach is Irene
Heim’s file change semantics (FCS, Heim 1983a) and the
discourse semantics of Seuren 1985). Meanings in DRT are so-called
discourse representation structures (DRSs). These structures
are a type of database that contains specific pieces of information.
In and of itself a DRS is a static object, but DRT can be said to be a
dynamic semantic framework because it allows us to understand the
process of composing meanings as a process of merging
discourse representation structures. In this way, information change
becomes an integral part of the interpretation process.

Our main focus in this entry is a second approach to dynamic
semantics, although we will compare things to DRT along the way. In
this second approach, dynamic meanings are types of actions, things
that are individuated by the changes they effect. This is the approach
associated with dynamic predicate logic (DPL, Groenendijk and
Stokhof 1991a). According to this dynamic semantic tradition, a
meaning is a specification of how a receiver’s information state
would be modified. It could for instance be a function that maps an
old information state to one which has been updated with the
information that the meaning embodies. Alternatively, it could be a
relation that expresses the kind of information change that the
meaning brings about. (For early work in this tradition, see
Groenendijk and Stokhof 1991a,b; Muskens 1991; Dekker 1993; Vermeulen
1993; van Eijck 1994; Vermeulen 1994; Krahmer 1995; van den Berg 1996;
Groenendijk et al. 1996; Aloni 1997; Muskens et al. 1997).

Analytic Philosophy in Early Modern India,0.7561075091362,0.329041987657547,"


Two older Indian philosophical traditions, the Nyāya
(grounded in Gautama Akṣapāda's
Nyāya-sūtra, c. 100 C.E., and dealing mainly
with logic, epistemology, and the theory of debate) and the
Vaiśeṣika (grounded in Kaṇāda's
Vaiśeṣika-sūtra, c. 100 B.C.E., dealing
mainly with ontology), developed in parallel until, at some point in
the 11th or 12th century, they merged to form a new school, called
“Navya-Nyāya”, the new Nyāya. Despite its
name, Navya-Nyāya incorporates and develops classical
Vaiśeṣika metaphysics as well as classical Nyāya
epistemology. The Navya-Nyāya authors also develop a precise
technical language through the employment of which many traditional
philosophical problems could be clarified and resolved.
Navya-Nyāya techniques proved to be so versatile that they were
employed, not just by philosophers, but also in poetics, linguistics,
legal theory, and other domains of medieval Indian thought. The
foundational text of this school was Gaṅgeśa's
brilliant and innovative Jewel of Reflection on the Truth
(Tattvacintāmaṇi). The school continued to
develop for about four centuries, reaching its heights with the works
of Raghunātha, Jagadīśa and Gadādhara (Ganeri 2014). The
sophisticated use this school made of its technical vocabulary made it
increasingly inaccessible, and so, in the 17th and 18th centuries,
several manuals or compendia were written to explain in simplified
language the basic tenets of the school. I will describe the
philosophical principles of Navya-Nyāya based on a synopsis of
the most successful of these, Annambhaṭṭa's
The Manual of Reason (Tarkasaṃgraha;
henceforth TS), together with its auto-commentary, the
Dīpikā (henceforth TSD). This text was
nicknamed Bāla-gādādharī, a sort
of ‘Beginners Guide to Gadādhara’. As well as
presenting the Vaiśeṣika theory of categories (a mixture
of physical theory, metaphysics and philosophy of psychology), and the
epistemological, methodological, and logical techniques of the new
Nyāya system, The Manual of Reason interjects
fascinating discussions on a wide variety of topics of philosophical
interest, making the text an enjoyable and informative introduction to
later Indian analytical philosophy (trans. G. Bhattacharya 1983; for
discussion of the text, see also Athalye 1930, Atreya 1948, C.

Meister Eckhart,0.5540192723274231,0.07679078727960588,"


Education and culture were the two driving forces behind European
urban development in the 13th and 14th centuries. Among the mendicant
orders that had settled in the cities were the Dominicans (ordo
fratrum praedicatorum), dedicated to promoting in their teaching,
way of life, and preaching the ideal of man’s
self-discovery—self-cultivation—as a singular cultural
value. The dynamics of this self-discovery can be said to be two-fold.
For, on one hand, man discovers himself by liberating himself from
himself and therewith finding—in himself—what transcends
him. On the other hand, what man finds in himself displays its own
movement as all that remains when his self-discovery has reached its
end. In this developmental context, Meister Eckhart directed his
theoretical analysis towards elucidating the self-movement of
intellect as such, in its differentiation, as a movement representing
in practical terms the only possible form of life. Indeed, in this era
of radical social upheaval, Eckhart put forward the dynamics of
intellect (reason, rationality) as the genuine wealth possessed by
those who are poor in spirit. His philosophical formulations and
theological statements served, in their reciprocal convergence, to
unfold in theoretical terms the dynamics of intellect with a view to
recommending the practice of processive reason as the exemplary form
of life.  Eckhart explained these dynamics mostly on the basis of
texts from the Holy Scriptures, whose philosophical content he set out
through philosophical arguments—something he was able to do
because he regarded the Holy Scriptures as a work of philosophy
(cf. Echardus, In Ioh. n. 444; LW III, 380, 12–14:
“evangelium contemplatur ens in quantum ens”:
“the Gospel treats of being insofar as it is
being”—Aristotle, as was well known, having defined the
object of metaphysics in precisely this manner). Yet Eckhart’s
explanations of these dynamics were also based on philosophical theses
closely linked to notions from the Holy Scriptures. In both cases, he
claimed to give unreserved expression to the new and rare (nova et
rara) in propagating what was for him the only possible form of
life: that of processive reason or of processes directed by reason. In
so doing, Meister Eckhart dedicated his life to philosophy: as a
philosopher holding a chair of theology at the University of Paris, as
a philosopher leading the Dominican Order, and as a philosopher
occupying the preacher’s pulpit.

The science of ecology studies interactions between individual
organisms and their environments, including interactions with both
conspecifics and members of other species. Though ecology emerged in
the 19th century much of its theoretical structure only emerged in the
twentieth century. Though ecology includes a wide variety of
sub-fields, philosophical analysis of ecology has so far been
restricted to population, community, and ecosystem ecology. Central
philosophical problems include explication of relevant notions of
ecological diversity and stability the relation between diversity and
stability. Other debated questions are the nature of laws and theories
in ecology, strategies of model-building, and reductionism.
Contemporary ecology is undergoing a conceptual upheaval because of
increased computational power. The recent emphasis on individual-based
models, which embrace methodological individualism, should be viewed as
a return of reductionism in ecology. Other important developments
include widespread interest in spatially explicit models and the advent
of Geographical Information Systems.

“Philosophy of Economics” consists of inquiries concerning
(a) rational choice, (b) the appraisal of economic outcomes,
institutions and processes, and (c) the ontology of economic phenomena
and the possibilities of acquiring knowledge of them. Although these
inquiries overlap in many ways, it is useful to divide philosophy of
economics in this way into three subject matters which can be regarded
respectively as branches of action theory, ethics (or normative social

theories of rationality, welfare, and social choice defend substantive
philosophical theses often informed by relevant philosophical
literature and of evident interest to those interested in action
theory, philosophical psychology, and social and political philosophy.
Economics is of particular interest to those interested in
epistemology and philosophy of science both because of its detailed
peculiarities and because it possesses many of the overt features of
the natural sciences, while its object consists of social

Philosophy of Education,0.5772125124931335,0.7310071587562561,"


All human societies, past and present, have had a vested interest in
education; and some wits have claimed that teaching (at its best an
educational activity) is the second oldest profession. While not all
societies channel sufficient resources into support for educational
activities and institutions, all at the very least acknowledge their
centrality—and for good reasons. For one thing, it is
obvious that children are born illiterate and innumerate, and ignorant
of the norms and cultural achievements of the community or society into
which they have been thrust; but with the help of professional teachers
and the dedicated amateurs in their families and immediate environs
(and with the aid, too, of educational resources made available through
the media and nowadays the internet), within a few years they can read,
write, calculate, and act (at least often) in culturally-appropriate
ways. Some learn these skills with more facility than others, and so
education also serves as a social-sorting mechanism and undoubtedly has
enormous impact on the economic fate of the individual. Put more
abstractly, at its best education equips individuals with the skills
and substantive knowledge that allows them to define and to pursue
their own goals, and also allows them to participate in the life of
their community as full-fledged, autonomous citizens.


But this is to cast matters in very individualistic terms, and it is
fruitful also to take a societal perspective, where the picture changes
somewhat. It emerges that in pluralistic societies such as the Western
democracies there are some groups that do not wholeheartedly support
the development of autonomous individuals, for such folk can weaken a
group from within by thinking for themselves and challenging communal
norms and beliefs; from the point of view of groups whose survival is
thus threatened, formal, state-provided education is not necessarily a
good thing. But in other ways even these groups depend for their
continuing survival on educational processes, as do the larger
societies and nation-states of which they are part; for as John Dewey
put it in the opening chapter of his classic work Democracy and
Education (1916), in its broadest sense education is the means of
the “social continuity of life” (Dewey 1916, 3). Dewey
pointed out that the “primary ineluctable facts of the birth and
death of each one of the constituent members in a social group”
make education a necessity, for despite this biological inevitability
“the life of the group goes on” (Dewey, 3). The great
social importance of education is underscored, too, by the fact that
when a society is shaken by a crisis, this often is taken as a sign of
educational breakdown; education, and educators, become scapegoats.


It is not surprising that such an important social domain has
attracted the attention of philosophers for thousands of years,
especially as there are complex issues aplenty that have great
philosophical interest. Even a cursory reading of these opening
paragraphs reveals that they touch on, in nascent form, some but by no
means all of the issues that have spawned vigorous debate down the
ages; restated more explicitly in terms familiar to philosophers of
education, the issues the discussion above flitted over were:
education as transmission of knowledge versus education as the
fostering of inquiry and reasoning skills that are conducive to the
development of autonomy (which, roughly, is the tension between
education as conservative and education as progressive and as an
instrument of human liberation, which also is closely related to
differing views about human “perfectibility”—issues
that historically have been raised in debates concerning the aims of
education); the question of what this knowledge, and what these
skills, ought to be—part of the domain of philosophy of the
curriculum; the questions of how learning is possible, and what is it
to have learned something—two sets of issues that relate to the
question of the capacities and potentialities that are present at
birth, and also to the process (and stages) of human development and
to what degree this process is flexible and hence can be influenced or
manipulated; the tension between liberal education and vocational
education, and the overlapping issue of which should be given
priority—education for personal development or education for
citizenship (and the issue of whether or not this is a false
dichotomy); the differences (if any) between education and
enculturation; the distinctions among educating versus teaching versus
training versus indoctrination; the relation between education and
maintenance of the class structure of society, and the issue of
whether different classes or cultural groups can—justly—be
given educational programs that differ in content or in aims; the
issue of whether the rights of children, parents, and socio-cultural
or ethnic groups, conflict—and if they do, the question of whose
rights should be privileged; the question as to whether or not all
children have a right to state-provided education, and if so, should
this education respect the beliefs and customs of all groups and how
on earth would this be accomplished; and a set of complex issues about
the relation between education and social reform, centering upon
whether education is essentially conservative, or whether it can
and/or should be an (or, the) agent of social change and/or
personal liberation. Perhaps the most fundamental issue is that
concerning aims: What are the basic aims and ideals of the educational
enterprise? What ought educators try to accomplish? It is worth noting
that in the Western philosophical tradition at least, most of the
major figures, with varying articulations and qualifications, regarded
the fostering of reason or rationality as a fundamental educational
aim. (Curren 2000, Scheffler 1973/1989, Siegel 1988, 1997,
2007)


It is impressive that most of the philosophically interesting issues
touched upon above, plus additional ones not alluded to here, were
addressed in one of the early masterpieces of the Western intellectual
tradition—Plato's Republic. A.N. Whitehead
somewhere remarked that the history of Western philosophy is nothing
but a series of footnotes to Plato, and if the Meno and the
Laws are added to the Republic, the same is true of
the history of educational thought and of philosophy of education in
particular. At various points throughout this essay the discussion
shall return to Plato, and at the end there shall be a brief discussion
of two other great figures in the field—Rousseau and Dewey.
But the account of the field needs to start with some features of it
that are apt to cause puzzlement, or that make describing its
topography difficult. These include, but are not limited to, the
interactions between philosophy of education and its parent
discipline.

Jonathan Edwards,0.6308576464653015,0.289063423871994,"

Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758) is widely acknowledged to be
America's most important and original philosophical theologian. His
work as a whole is an expression of two themes — the absolute
sovereignty of God and the beauty of God's holiness. The first is
articulated in Edwards' defense of theological determinism, in a
doctrine of occasionalism, and in his insistence that physical objects
are only collections of sensible “ideas” while finite
minds are mere assemblages of “thoughts” or
“perceptions.” As the only real cause or substance
underlying physical and mental phenomena, God is “being in
general,” the “sum of all being.”

Edwards' second theme is articulated in accounts of God's end in
creation, and of the nature of true virtue and true beauty. God
creates in order to manifest a holiness which consists in a
benevolence which alone is truly beautiful. Genuine human virtue is an
imitation of divine benevolence and all finite beauty is an image of
divine loveliness. True virtue is needed to discern this beauty,
however, and to reason rightly about “divine things.”

Edwards' projected History of Redemption would have drawn
these themes together, for it is in his redemptive work in history
that God's sovereignty, holiness, and beauty are most clearly
exhibited.

Egalitarianism,0.4821489155292511,0.742127537727356,"


Egalitarianism is a trend of thought in political philosophy. An
egalitarian favors equality of some sort: People should get the same,
or be treated the same, or be treated as equals, in some respect. An
alternative view expands on this last-mentioned option: People should
be treated as equals, should treat one another as equals, should relate
as equals, or enjoy an equality of social status of some sort.
Egalitarian doctrines tend to rest on a background idea that all human
persons are equal in fundamental worth or moral status. So far as the
Western European and Anglo-American philosophical tradition is
concerned, one significant source of this thought is the Christian
notion that God loves all human souls equally. Egalitarianism is a
protean doctrine, because there are several different types of
equality, or ways in which people might be treated the same, or might
relate as equals, that might be thought desirable. In modern democratic
societies, the term “egalitarian” is often used to refer to a position
that favors, for any of a wide array of reasons, a greater degree of
equality of income and wealth across persons than currently exists.

The Hole Argument,0.8914779424667358,0.3625498116016388,"


What is space? What is time? Do they exist independently of the things
and processes in them? Or is their existence parasitic on these things
and processes? Are they like a canvas onto which an artist paints;
they exist whether or not the artist paints on them? Or are they akin
to parenthood; there is no parenthood until there are parents and
children? That is, is there no space and time until there are things
with spatial properties and processes with temporal durations?


These questions have long been debated and continue to be debated.
The hole argument arose when these questions were asked in the context
of modern spacetime physics. In that context, space and time are fused
into a single entity, spacetime, and we inquire into its status. One
view is that spacetime is a substance, a thing that exists
independently of the processes occurring within spacetime. This is
spacetime substantivalism. The hole argument seeks to show that this
viewpoint leads to unpalatable conclusions in a large class of
spacetime theories. Spacetime substantivalism requires that we ascribe
such a surfeit of properties to spacetime that neither observation nor
even the laws of the relevant spacetime theory itself can determine
which are the correct ones. Such abundance is neither logically
contradictory nor refuted by experience. But there must be some bounds
on how rich a repertoire of hidden properties can be ascribed to
spacetime. The hole argument urges that spacetime substantivalism goes
beyond those bounds.

 The hole argument depends upon a gauge freedom in general relativity;
that is, the presence of surplus mathematical structure in general
relativity that has no correlate in physical reality. The hole
argument provides a template for the analysis of gauge freedoms in
physical theories. We learn from it that the identification of surplus
mathematical structure cannot be achieved by any a priori or purely
mathematical rule. Some physical grounds are needed. The hole argument
provides two grounds that can be used: verifiability—changes
in the candidate surplus structure make no difference to what can be
verified in observation; determinism—the laws of the theory
are unable to fix the candidate surplus structure.  


The hole argument was invented for slightly different purposes by
Albert Einstein late in 1913 as part of his quest for the general
theory of relativity. It was revived and reformulated in the modern
context by John3 = John Earman × John Stachel × John
Norton.
See Stachel (2014) for a review that covers the historical aspects
of the hole argument and its significance in philosophy and
physics. It is written at a technically more advanced level than this

particular the possibility of their causal interaction and the nature
of their union. They also correspond on Descartes's physics, on the
passions and their regulation, on the nature of virtue and the greatest
good, on the nature of human freedom of the will and its compatibility
with divine causal determination, and on political philosophy.
Descartes dedicated his Principles of Philosophy to Elisabeth,
and wrote his Passions of the Soul at her request. While there
is much to be learned about Descartes's views by reading this exchange,
my concern in this entry is not to focus on its import for

Emergence is a notorious philosophical term of art. A variety of

thus: emergent entities (properties or substances) ‘arise’
out of more fundamental entities and yet are ‘novel’ or
‘irreducible’ with respect to them. (For example, it is
sometimes said that consciousness is an emergent property of the
brain.) Each of the quoted terms is slippery in its own right, and
their specifications yield the varied notions of emergence that we

Emotion,0.5198905467987059,0.3685865104198456,"

No aspect of our mental life is more important to the quality and
meaning of our existence than emotions. They are what make life worth
living, or sometimes ending. So it is not surprising that most of the
great classical philosophers—Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, Descartes,
Hobbes, Hume—had recognizable theories of emotion, conceived as
responses to certain sorts of events of concern to a subject,
triggering bodily changes and typically motivating characteristic
behavior. What is surprising is that in much of the twentieth-century
philosophers of mind and psychologists tended to neglect them—perhaps
because the sheer variety of phenomena covered by the word “emotion”
and its closest neighbors tends to discourage tidy theory. In recent
years, however, emotions have once again become the focus of vigorous
interest in philosophy, as well as in other branches of cognitive
science. In view of the proliferation of increasingly fruitful
exchanges between researchers of different stripes, it is no longer
useful to speak of the philosophy of emotion in isolation from the
approaches of other disciplines, particularly psychology, neurology,
evolutionary biology, and even economics. While it is quite impossible
to do justice to those approaches here, some sidelong glances in their
direction will aim to suggest their philosophical importance. 

I begin by outlining some of the ways that philosophers have
conceived of the place of emotions in the topography of the mind,
particularly in their relation to bodily states, to motivation, and to
beliefs and desires, as well as some of the ways in which they have
envisaged the relation between different emotions. Most emotions have
an intentional structure: we shall need to say something about what
that means. Psychology and more recently evolutionary biology have
offered a number of theories of emotions, stressing their function in
the conduct of life. Philosophers have been especially partial to
cognitivist theories, emphasizing analogies either with propositional
judgments or with perception. But different theories implicitly posit
different ontologies of emotion, and there has been some dispute about
what emotions really are, and indeed whether they are any kind of thing
at all. Emotions also raise normative questions: about the extent to
which they can be said to be rational, or can contribute to
rationality. In that regard the question of our knowledge of our own
emotions is especially problematic, as it seems they are both the
object of our most immediate awareness and the most powerful source of
our capacity for self-deception. This results in a particularly
ambivalent relation between emotions and morality. I will conclude with
a brief survey of some recent trends, particularly as they affect and
are influenced by the neighboring disciplines in which the study of
emotions has become increasingly prominent.

One of the many uses of the Greek word pathos in ancient
philosophy referred, roughly speaking, to what we call emotions. The
corresponding Latin terms were passio, affectus or
affectio. Medieval theories of emotions were essentially
based on ancient sources. The new developments included the
discussion of emotions from the point of view of Avicennian faculty
psychology, the production of systematic taxonomies particularly in
thirteenth-century Aristotelianism, the detailed studies of voluntary
and involuntary aspects of emotional reactions, as well as late
medieval re-evaluations of the sharp divide between the emotions and
the will.

Empathy,0.5578098893165588,0.7175009250640869,"


Despite its linguistic roots in ancient Greek, the concept of empathy
is of recent intellectual heritage. Yet its history has been varied
and colorful, a fact that is also mirrored in the multiplicity of
definitions associated with the empathy concept in a number of
different scientific and non-scientific discourses. In its
philosophical heyday at the turn of the 19th to the
20th century, empathy had been hailed as the primary means
for gaining knowledge of other minds and as the method uniquely suited
for the human sciences, only to be almost entirely neglected
philosophically for the rest of the century. Only recently have
philosophers become again interested in empathy in light of the debate
about our folk psychological mindreading capacities. In the second
half of the last century, the task of addressing empathy was mainly
left to psychologists who thematized it as a psychological phenomenon
and process to be studied by the method of the empirical sciences.
Particularly, it has been studied by social psychologists as a
phenomenon assumed to be causally involved in creating prosocial
attitudes and behavior. Nevertheless, within psychology it is at times
difficult to find agreement of how exactly one should understand
empathy; a fact of which psychologists themselves have become
increasingly aware. The purpose of this entry is to clarify the
empathy concept by surveying its history in various philosophical and
psychological discussions and by indicating why empathy was and should
be regarded to be of such central importance in understanding human
agency in ordinary contexts, in the human sciences and for the
constitution of ourselves as social and moral agents.

Empedocles,0.6586464047431946,0.0006424413877539338,"


In antiquity, Empedocles (ca. 495–435 BCE) was characterized as
active on the democratic side in the politics of his native city of
Acragas in Sicily, and as a physician, as well as a philosopher and
poet. His philosophical and scientific theories are mentioned and
discussed in several dialogues of Plato, and they figure prominently
in Aristotle's writings on physics and biology and, as a result, also
in the later Greek commentaries on Aristotle's works. Diogenes
Laertius devotes one of his Lives of Eminent Philosophers to
him (VIII, 51–77). His writings, which are poetical in form, have come down to us mostly in fragments preserved as quotations in the works of these
and other ancient authors. Extensive fragments, some of them not
previously known, were recently found preserved on a papyrus roll from
Egypt in the Strasbourg University library (see Martin and Primavesi
1999). The numbering of the fragments in this article follows that of
the Diels-Kranz edition; the translations are from Kirk, Raven, and
Schofield 1983.


Traditionally, Empedocles' writings were held to consist of two poems,
in hexameter verse, entitled On Nature and
Purifications. However, some modern commentators have argued
that the two were originally one work—a position re-energized by the
recently edited fragments of the Strasbourg manuscript. In any event,
the papyrus does show the two to be thematically more closely related
than previously thought.  Nevertheless, the themes of the two parts
(if they did belong to a single poem) are sufficiently distinct that
separate treatment is appropriate here. Even if there is not a strict
separation of the two themes, the first primarily concerns the
formation, structure, and history of the physical world as a whole,
and the formation of the animals and plants within it; the second
concerns moral topics. For convenience, this article uses the
traditional names for the two collections of fragments.

Rationalism vs. Empiricism,0.6822567582130432,0.3850804567337036,"

The dispute between rationalism and empiricism concerns the extent to
which we are dependent upon sense experience in our effort to gain
knowledge. Rationalists claim that there are significant ways in which
our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense
experience. Empiricists claim that sense experience is the ultimate
source of all our concepts and knowledge.

Rationalists generally develop their view in two ways. First, they
argue that there are cases where the content of our concepts or
knowledge outstrips the information that sense experience can provide.
Second, they construct accounts of how reason in some form or other
provides that additional information about the world. Empiricists
present complementary lines of thought. First, they develop accounts
of how experience provides the information that rationalists cite,
insofar as we have it in the first place. (Empiricists will at times
opt for skepticism as an alternative to rationalism: if experience
cannot provide the concepts or knowledge the rationalists cite, then
we don’t have them.) Second, empiricists attack the
rationalists’ accounts of how reason is a source of concepts or
knowledge.

Ancient and Medieval Empiricism,0.6802068948745728,0.21705523133277893,"

Although empiricism is often thought to be a modern doctrine, it has
ancient roots, and its modern forms are built on late medieval
developments. This article will begin by outlining three different
forms of empiricism. It will examine the Presocratic and Hippocratic
origins of the empiricist attitude, and discuss its development in the
work of Aristotle, the Hellenistic medical writers, sceptics, and
Epicureans. It will then examine the combination of Aristotelian and
Augustinian views in the work of thirteenth and fourteenth-century
thinkers, the connection between the study of magic and empiricism, the
eclipse of the doctrine of divine illumination, and the gradual
downplaying of the role of the intellect in the acquisition of
knowledge.

Why study these ancient thinkers? To those who hold that “no
conception can be properly understood except through its
history” (Comte 1934: 2), the answer will seem obvious. But even
those who prefer to engage in philosophical reflection, rather than
studying its history, may find these thinkers illuminating.
Empiricists have always had difficulty giving an account of key
aspects of both everyday and scientific knowledge. They have found it
hard to explain how we could know about logical and mathematical
truths, causal relations, and (more generally) the modal structure of
the world (how things could be). Insofar as we are still faced with
these questions, we may be able to learn from the answers our
predecessors gave.

Logical Empiricism,0.8575928807258606,0.5834680795669556,"


Logical empiricism is a philosophic movement rather than a set of
doctrines, and it flourished in the 1920s and 30s in several centers
in Europe and in the 40s and 50s in the United States. It had several
different leaders whose views changed considerably over
time. Moreover, these thinkers differed from one another, often
sharply.  Because logical empiricism is here construed as a movement
rather than as doctrine, there is probably no important position that
all logical empiricists shared—including, surprisingly enough,
empiricism.  And while most participants in the movement were
empiricists of one form or another, they disagreed on what the best
form of empiricism was and on the cognitive status of empiricism. What
held the group together was a common concern for scientific
methodology and the important role that science could play in
reshaping society. Within that scientific methodology the logical
empiricists wanted to find a natural and important role for logic and
mathematics and to find an understanding of philosophy according to
which it was part of the scientific enterprise.


The following discussion of logical empiricism is organized under five
headings:

Enlightenment,0.6005573272705078,0.4471359550952912,"

The heart of the eighteenth century Enlightenment is the loosely
organized activity of prominent French thinkers of the mid-decades of
the eighteenth century, the so-called
“philosophes”(e.g., Voltaire, D’Alembert,
Diderot, Montesquieu). The philosophes constituted an
informal society of men of letters who collaborated on a loosely
defined project of Enlightenment exemplified by the project of the
Encyclopedia (see below 1.5). However, there are noteworthy
centers of Enlightenment outside of France as well. There is a
renowned Scottish Enlightenment (key figures are Frances Hutcheson,
Adam Smith, David Hume, Thomas Reid), a German Enlightenment (die
Aufklärung, key figures of which include Christian Wolff,
Moses Mendelssohn, G.E. Lessing and Immanuel Kant), and there are also
other hubs of Enlightenment and Enlightenment thinkers scattered
throughout Europe and America in the eighteenth century.

What makes for the unity of such tremendously diverse thinkers under
the label of “Enlightenment”? For the purposes of this
entry, the Enlightenment is conceived broadly. D’Alembert, a
leading figure of the French Enlightenment, characterizes his
eighteenth century, in the midst of it, as “the century of
philosophy par excellence”, because of the tremendous
intellectual and scientific progress of the age, but also because of
the expectation of the age that philosophy (in the broad sense of the
time, which includes the natural and social sciences) would
dramatically improve human life. Guided by D’Alembert’s
characterization of his century, the Enlightenment is conceived here
as having its primary origin in the scientific revolution of the 16th
and 17th centuries. The rise of the new science progressively
undermines not only the ancient geocentric conception of the cosmos,
but also the set of presuppositions that had served to constrain and
guide philosophical inquiry in the earlier times. The dramatic success
of the new science in explaining the natural world promotes philosophy
from a handmaiden of theology, constrained by its purposes and
methods, to an independent force with the power and authority to
challenge the old and construct the new, in the realms both of theory
and practice, on the basis of its own principles. Taking as the core
of the Enlightenment the aspiration for intellectual progress, and the
belief in the power of such progress to improve human society and
individual lives, this entry includes descriptions of relevant aspects
of the thought of earlier thinkers, such as Hobbes, Locke, Descartes,
Bayle, Leibniz, and Spinoza, thinkers whose contributions are
indispensable to understanding the eighteenth century as “the
century of philosophy par excellence”.

The Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions
and ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789. The energy
created and expressed by the intellectual foment of Enlightenment
thinkers contributes to the growing wave of social unrest in France in
the eighteenth century. The social unrest comes to a head in the
violent political upheaval which sweeps away the traditionally and
hierarchically structured ancien régime (the monarchy,
the privileges of the nobility, the political power of the Catholic
Church). The French revolutionaries meant to establish in place of the
ancien régime a new reason-based order instituting the
Enlightenment ideals of liberty and equality. Though the
Enlightenment, as a diverse intellectual and social movement, has no
definite end, the devolution of the French Revolution into the Terror
in the 1790s, corresponding, as it roughly does, with the end of the
eighteenth century and the rise of opposed movements, such as
Romanticism, can serve as a convenient marker of the end of the
Enlightenment, conceived as an historical period.

For Enlightenment thinkers themselves, however, the Enlightenment is
not an historical period, but a process of social, psychological or
spiritual development, unbound to time or place. Immanuel Kant defines
“enlightenment” in his famous contribution to debate on
the question in an essay entitled “An Answer to the Question:
What is Enlightenment?” (1784), as humankind’s release
from its self-incurred immaturity; “immaturity is the inability
to use one’s own understanding without the guidance of
another.” Expressing convictions shared among Enlightenment
thinkers of widely divergent doctrines, Kant identifies enlightenment
with the process of undertaking to think for oneself, to employ and
rely on one’s own intellectual capacities in determining what to
believe and how to act. Enlightenment philosophers from across the
geographical and temporal spectrum tend to have a great deal of
confidence in humanity’s intellectual powers, both to achieve
systematic knowledge of nature and to serve as an authoritative guide
in practical life. This confidence is generally paired with suspicion
or hostility toward other forms or carriers of authority (such as
tradition, superstition, prejudice, myth and miracles), insofar as
these are seen to compete with the authority of one’s own reason
and experience. Enlightenment philosophy tends to stand in tension
with established religion, insofar as the release from self-incurred
immaturity in this age, daring to think for oneself, awakening
one’s intellectual powers, generally requires opposing the role
of established religion in directing thought and action. The faith of
the Enlightenment – if one may call it that – is that the
process of enlightenment, of becoming progressively self-directed in
thought and action through the awakening of one’s intellectual
powers, leads ultimately to a better, more fulfilled human
existence.

This entry describes the main tendencies of Enlightenment thought in
the following main sections: (1) The True: Science, Epistemology, and
Metaphysics in the Enlightenment; (2) The Good: Political Theory,
Ethical Theory and Religion in the Enlightenment; (3) The Beautiful:

Logical Consequence,0.830572247505188,0.6999044418334961,"


A good argument is one whose conclusions follow from its premises;
its conclusions are consequences of its premises. But in what
sense do conclusions follow from premises? What is it for a
conclusion to be a consequence of premises? Those questions,
in many respects, are at the heart of logic (as a philosophical
discipline). Consider the following argument:

If we charge high fees for university, only the rich will enroll.

We charge high fees for university.

Therefore, only the rich will enroll.



There are many different things one can say about this argument, but
many agree that if we do not equivocate (if the terms mean the same
thing in the premises and the conclusion) then the argument is
valid, that is, the conclusion follows deductively from the
premises. This does not mean that the conclusion is true. Perhaps the
premises are not true. However, if the premises are true, then the
conclusion is also true, as a matter of logic. This entry is about the
relation between premises and conclusions in valid arguments.


Contemporary analyses of the concept of consequence—of the
follows from relation—take it to be both
necessary and formal, with such answers often being
explicated via proofs or models (or, in some cases,
both). Our aim in this article is to provide a brief characterisation
of some of the notions that play a central role in contemporary
accounts of logical consequence.


We should note that we only highlight a few of the
philosophical aspects of logical consequence, leaving out
almost all technical details, and also leaving out a large number of
philosophical debates about the topic. Our rationale for doing as much
is that one will get the technical details, and the particular
philosophical issues that motivated them, from looking at specific
logics—specific theories of logical consequence (e.g.,
relevant logics, substructural logics, non-monotonic logics, dynamic
logics, modal logics, theories of quantification, and so on).
(Moreover, debates about almost any feature of
language—structure versus form of sentences, propositions,
context sensitivity, meaning, even truth—are relevant to debates
about logical consequence, making an exhaustive discussion practically
impossible.)  Our aim here is simply to touch on a few of the very
basic issues that are central to logical consequence.

Envy,0.5160682201385498,0.6285297274589539,"

Envy is a complex and puzzling emotion. It is, notoriously, one of the
seven deadly sins in the Catholic tradition. It is very commonly
charged with being (either typically or universally) unreasonable,
irrational, imprudent, vicious, or wrong to feel. With very few
exceptions, the ample philosophical literature defending the
rationality and evaluative importance of emotions explicitly excludes
envy and a few other nasty emotions as irredeemable. Indeed, some
authors who are prepared to defend even jealousy insist that envy is
beyond the pale. Yet there is considerable controversy over what
precisely envy is, and the cogency of various specific criticisms of
envy depends on what view of that subject is adopted. 

In addition to its centrality to discussions in the philosophy of
emotions, envy has sparked controversies in political philosophy.
Perhaps best known among these is the claim that egalitarian views of
justice are motivated by envy. It also receives substantial treatment
from John Rawls, who takes pains to argue that envy does not pose a
threat to his theory of justice. Each of these topics receives some
treatment below.

Epicurus,0.6161510944366455,0.005464151967316866,"


The philosophy of Epicurus (341–270 B.C.E.) was a complete and
interdependent system, involving a view of the goal of human life
(happiness, resulting from absence of physical pain and mental
disturbance), an empiricist theory of knowledge (sensations, together with
the perception of pleasure and pain, are infallible criteria), a
description of nature based on atomistic materialism, and a
naturalistic account of evolution, from the formation of the world to
the emergence of human societies. Epicurus believed that, on the basis
of a radical materialism which dispensed with transcendent entities
such as the Platonic Ideas or Forms, he could disprove the possibility
of the soul’s survival after death, and hence the prospect of
punishment in the afterlife. He regarded the unacknowledged fear of
death and punishment as the primary cause of anxiety among human
beings, and anxiety in turn as the source of extreme and irrational
desires. The elimination of the fears and corresponding desires would
leave people free to pursue the pleasures, both physical and mental, to
which they are naturally drawn, and to enjoy the peace of mind that is
consequent upon their regularly expected and achieved satisfaction. It
remained to explain how irrational fears arose in the first place:
hence the importance of an account of social evolution. Epicurus was
aware that deeply ingrained habits of thought are not easily corrected,
and thus he proposed various exercises to assist the novice. His system
included advice on the proper attitude toward politics (avoid it where
possible) and the gods (do not imagine that they concern themselves
about human beings and their behavior), the role of sex (dubious),
marriage (also dubious) and friendship (essential), reflections on the
nature of various meteorological and planetary phenomena, about which
it was best to keep an open mind in the absence of decisive
verification, and explanations of such processes as gravity (that is, the tendency of objects to fall to the surface of the earth) and
magnetism, which posed considerable challenges to the ingenuity of the
earlier atomists. Although the overall structure of Epicureanism was
designed to hang together and to serve its principal ethical goals,
there was room for a great deal of intriguing philosophical argument
concerning every aspect of the system, from the speed of atoms in a
void to the origin of optical illusions.

Epiphenomenalism,0.7844454050064087,0.4706697165966034,"


Epiphenomenalism is the view that mental events are caused by physical
events in the brain, but have no effects upon any physical events.
Behavior is caused by muscles that contract upon receiving neural
impulses, and neural impulses are generated by input from other neurons
or from sense organs. On the epiphenomenalist view, mental events play
no causal role in this process. Huxley (1874), who held the view,
compared mental events to a steam whistle that contributes nothing to
the work of a locomotive. James (1879), who rejected the view,
characterized epiphenomenalists' mental events as not affecting the
brain activity that produces them “any more than a shadow reacts upon
the steps of the traveller whom it accompanies”. 



Ancient theories of the soul gave rise to debates among Aristotle's
successors that have a strong resemblance to some contemporary
discussions of the efficacy of mental events (Caston, 1997). The modern
discussion of epiphenomenalism, however, traces back to a 19th century
context, in which a dualistic view of mental events was assumed to be
correct. The first part of our discussion — Traditional Arguments —
will be phrased in a style that reflects this dualistic presupposition.
By contrast, many contemporary discussions work within a background
assumption of the preferability of materialist monism. One might have
supposed that this position would have put an end to the need to
investigate epiphenomenalism; but, as we shall see under Arguments in
the Age of Materialism, such a supposition is far from being the case.
A brief outline of both discussions follows.

Epistemic Closure,0.7284712195396423,0.7163389921188354,"

Most of us think we can safely enlarge our knowledge base by accepting
things that are entailed by (or logically implied by) things we know.
Roughly speaking, the set of things we know is closed under entailment
(or under deduction or logical implication), so we know that a given
claim is true upon recognizing, and accepting thereby, that it follows
from what we know. This is not to say that our usual way of adding to
our knowledge is simply to recognize and accept what follows from what
we already know. Obviously much more is involved. For instance, we
gather data and construct explanations of those data, and under
suitable circumstances we learn from others. More to the point at
hand, when we claim that we know, of some proposition, that it is
true, that claim is itself subject to error; often, seeing what
follows from a knowledge claim prompts us to reassess and even
withdraw our claim, instead of concluding, of the things that follow
from it, that we know that they are true. Still, it seems reasonable
to think that if we do know that some proposition is true
then we are in a position to know, of the things that follow from it,
that they, too, are true. However, some theorists have denied that
knowledge is closed under entailment. The arguments against closure
include the following:


The argument from the analysis of knowledge: given the
correct analysis, knowledge is not closed, so it isn't. For example,
if the correct analysis includes a tracking condition, then closure
fails.

The argument from nonclosure of knowledge modes: since the
modes of gaining, preserving or extending knowledge, such as
perception, testimony, proof, memory, indication, and information are
not individually closed, neither is knowledge.

The argument from unknowable (or not easily knowable)
propositions: certain sorts of propositions cannot be known
(without special measures); given closure, they could be known
(without special measures), by deducing them from mundane claims we
known, so knowledge is not closed.

The argument from skepticism: skepticism is false but it
would be true if knowledge were closed, so knowledge is not
closed.


While proponents of closure have responses to these arguments, they
also argue, somewhat in the style of G. E. Moore (1959), that closure
itself is a firm datum—it is obvious enough to rule out any
understanding of knowledge or related notions that undermines
closure.

A closely related idea is that it is rational (justifiable) for us to
believe anything that follows from what it is rational for us to
believe. This idea is intimately related to the thesis that knowledge
is closed, since, according to some theorists, knowing p
entails justifiably believing p. If knowledge entails
justification, closure failure of the latter might lead to closure
failure of the former.

Epistemic paradoxes are riddles that turn on the concept of knowledge

correcting at least one deep error – if not directly about
knowledge, then about its kindred concepts such as justification,
rational belief, and evidence.

Such corrections are of interest to epistemologists. Historians date
the origin of epistemology to the appearance of skeptics. As manifest

doubt one’s own motives, or one’s competence to drive a
car. One can doubt that one is up to the challenge of fighting a
serious illness. Epistemic self-doubt is the special case where what
we doubt is our ability to achieve an epistemically favorable state,
for example, to achieve true beliefs. Given our obvious fallibility,
epistemic self-doubt seems a natural thing to engage in, and there is
definitely nothing logically problematic about doubting someone
else’s competence to judge. However when we turn such doubt on
ourselves, incoherence seems to threaten because one is using
one’s judgment to make a negative assessment of one’s
judgment. Even if this kind of self-doubt can be seen as coherent,
there are philosophical challenges concerning how to resolve the inner
conflict involved in such a judgment, whether one’s initial
judgment or one’s doubt should win, and why.

Some ways of doubting that we are in a favorable epistemic state are
easy to understand and unproblematic. Socrates was confident that he
did not know the answers to his most important questions. He believed
he did not have the answers, or the right kind of grasp of answers,
that would be required for knowledge of what, for example, piety,
virtue, and justice are. This recognition led him to avoid endorsing
or believing particular answers to his questions, and motivated him to
go around town asking others for their answers and making awkward
observations about their replies. Though the authorities prosecuted
him for this, his offense was not an epistemic irrationality; the
belief states he had—doubt about himself that he knew the
answers, and lack of confidence in particular answers—fit
together sensibly. Moreover, as Socrates told his interlocutors, his
acknowledgment that he did not know had the salutary effect of making
it possible for him to find out. If he were sure that he already knew,
then he would not have motivation to look for the answer.

Not all epistemic self-doubt is so evidently constructive. Socrates
could hope to find his answers in the future in part because his doubt
was not directed at his faculties for gaining knowledge, and the
matters on which he believed himself ignorant were specific and
limited. This left him confident of his tools, and still in possession
of a lot of knowledge to work with in seeking his answers. For
example, it was possible for Socrates to be both sure he did not know
what virtue was and yet confident that it was something beneficial to
the soul. In contrast, Descartes in his Meditations set out
to rid himself of all beliefs in order to rebuild his edifice of
belief from scratch, so as to avoid all possibility of erroneous
foundations. He did so by finding reason to doubt the soundness of his
faculty of, for example, sense perception. Instead of casting doubt on
his empirical beliefs one by one, he would doubt the reliability of
their source and that would blanket all of them with suspicion,
loosening the hold that even basic perceptual beliefs had on his mind.
Descartes’ epistemic self-doubt was extreme in undermining trust
in a belief-forming faculty, and in the wide scope of beliefs that
were thereby called into question. As in the case of Socrates though,
his belief states fit together sensibly; as he convinced himself he
might be dreaming, thus undermining his trust that he was in a
position to know he had hands, he was also shaken out of his belief
that he had hands.

The cases of Socrates and Descartes illustrate that judgments about
one’s own epistemic state and capacity can provide reasons to
adjust one’s beliefs about the way things are. Less dramatic
cases abound in which rationality’s demand for some kind of fit
between one’s beliefs (first-order beliefs) and one’s
beliefs about one’s beliefs (second-order beliefs) can be seen
in the breach. Suppose I am a medical doctor who has just settled on a
diagnosis of embolism for a patient when someone points out to me that
I haven’t slept in 36 hours (Christensen 2010a). On reflection I
realize that she is right, and if I am rational then I will feel some
pressure to believe that my judgment might be impaired, reduce
somewhat my confidence in the embolism diagnosis, and re-check my
work-up of the case or ask for a colleague’s opinion.

Though it seems clear in this case that some reconsideration of the
first-order matter is required, it is not immediately clear how strong
the authority of the second-order might be compared to the first order
in coming to an updated belief about the diagnosis, and there are
clear cases where the second order should not prevail. If someone
tells me I have unwittingly ingested a hallucinogenic drug, then that
imposes some prima facie demand for further thought on my part, but if
I know the person is a practical joker and he has a smirk on his face,
then it seems permissible not to reconsider my first-order beliefs.
There are also cases where it is not obvious which order should
prevail. Suppose I’m confident that the murderer is #3 in the
line-up because I witnessed the murder at close range. Then I learn of
the empirical literature saying that eyewitnesses are generally
overconfident, especially when they witnessed the event in a state of
stress (Roush 2009: 252–3). It seems I should doubt my
identification, but how can it be justified to throw out my
first-order evidence that came from directly seeing that person, in
person and close up? An adjudication of some sort between the first
order and the higher order is required, but it is not obvious what the
general rules might be for determining the outcome of the conflict, or
what exactly would justify them.

Questions about epistemic self-doubt can be organized into five
over-arching questions: 1) Can the doubting itself, a state of having
a belief state and doubting that it is the right one to have, be
rational? 2) What is the source of the authority of second-order
beliefs? 3) Are there general rules for deciding which level should
win the tug of war? If so, what is their justification? 4) What does
the matching relation this adjudication is aiming at consist in? 5) If
mismatch between the levels can be rational when one first acquires
reason to doubt, is it also rationally permitted to remain in a
level-splitting state—also known as epistemic akrasia
(Owens 2002)—in which the self-doubting conflict is
maintained?

For convenience, approaches to modeling doubt about one’s own
ability to judge and to the five questions above can be separated into
four types, which are overlapping and complementary rather than
inconsistent. One approach is through seeing the self-doubting subject
as believing epistemically unflattering categorical statements about
the relation of her beliefs to the world. Another is through
conditional principles, asking what a subject’s credence in
q should be given that she has a particular credence in
q but thinks she may be epistemically inadequate or
compromised. A third approach is to construe doubt about one’s
judgment as a matter of respecting evidence about oneself and
one’s evidence (higher-order evidence). A fourth approach ties
together the first order and second order by using the idea that we
should match our confidence in p to our expected reliability.
That is, treating ourselves like measuring instruments we should aim
to be calibrated.

Defined narrowly, epistemology is the study of knowledge and
justified belief. As the study of knowledge, epistemology is concerned
with the following questions: What are the necessary and sufficient
conditions of knowledge? What are its sources? What is its structure,
and what are its limits? As the study of justified belief, epistemology
aims to answer questions such as: How we are to understand the concept
of justification? What makes justified beliefs justified? Is
justification internal or external to one's own mind? Understood more
broadly, epistemology is about issues having to do with the
creation and dissemination of knowledge in particular areas of inquiry.
This article will provide a systematic overview of the problems that
the questions above raise and focus in some depth on issues relating to
the structure and the limits of knowledge and justification.

Bayesian Epistemology,0.7616968154907227,0.8187922239303589,"


‘Bayesian epistemology’ became an epistemological movement
in the 20th century, though its two main features can be
traced back to the eponymous Reverend Thomas Bayes (c. 1701–61). Those
two features are: (1) the introduction of a formal apparatus
for inductive logic; (2) the introduction of a pragmatic
self-defeat test (as illustrated by Dutch Book Arguments) for
epistemic rationality as a way of extending the justification
of the laws of deductive logic to include a justification for the laws
of inductive logic. The formal apparatus itself has two main elements:
the use of the laws of probability as coherence constraints on
rational degrees of belief (or degrees of confidence) and the
introduction of a rule of probabilistic inference, a rule or principle
of conditionalization.



Bayesian epistemology did not emerge as a philosophical program
until the first formal axiomatizations of probability theory in the
first half of the 20th century. One important
application of Bayesian epistemology has been to the analysis of
scientific practice in Bayesian Confirmation Theory. In
addition, a major branch of statistics, Bayesian
statistics, is based on Bayesian principles. In psychology,
an important branch of learning theory, Bayesian learning
theory, is also based on Bayesian principles. Finally, the
idea of analyzing rational degrees of belief in terms of rational
betting behavior led to the 20th century development of a
new kind of decision theory, Bayesian decision theory, which is
now the dominant theoretical model for both the descriptive and
normative analysis of decisions. The combination of its precise
formal apparatus and its novel pragmatic self-defeat test for
justification makes Bayesian epistemology one of the most important
developments in epistemology in the 20th century, and one of
the most promising avenues for further progress in epistemology in the
21st century.

Evolutionary Epistemology is a naturalistic approach to epistemology,
which emphasizes the importance of natural selection in two primary
roles. In the first role, selection is the generator and maintainer of
the reliability of our senses and cognitive mechanisms, as well as the
“fit” between those mechanisms and the world. In the second role, trial
and error learning and the evolution of scientific theories are
construed as selection processes.

Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science,0.6235643029212952,0.7114275693893433,"


Feminist epistemology and philosophy of science studies the ways in
which gender does and ought to influence our conceptions of knowledge,
the knowing subject, and practices of inquiry and justification. It
identifies ways in which dominant conceptions and practices of
knowledge attribution, acquisition, and justification systematically
disadvantage women and other subordinated groups, and strives to
reform these conceptions and practices so that they serve the
interests of these groups. Various practitioners of feminist
epistemology and philosophy of science argue that dominant knowledge
practices disadvantage women by (1) excluding them from inquiry, (2)
denying them epistemic authority, (3) denigrating their
“feminine” cognitive styles and modes of knowledge, (4)
producing theories of women that represent them as inferior, deviant,
or significant only in the ways they serve male interests, (5)
producing theories of social phenomena that render women's activities
and interests, or gendered power relations, invisible, and (6)
producing knowledge (science and technology) that is not useful for
people in subordinate positions, or that reinforces gender and other
social hierarchies. Feminist epistemologists trace these failures to
flawed conceptions of knowledge, knowers, objectivity, and scientific
methodology. They offer diverse accounts of how to overcome these
failures. They also aim to (1) explain why the entry of women and
feminist scholars into different academic disciplines, especially in
biology and the social sciences, has generated new questions,
theories, and methods, (2) show how gender and feminist values and
perspectives have played a causal role in these transformations, (3)
promote theories that aid egalitarian and liberation movements, and
(4) defend these developments as cognitive, not just social, advances.



The central concept of feminist epistemology is that of a situated
knower, and hence of situated knowledge: knowledge that reflects the
particular perspectives of the subject. Feminist philosophers are
interested in how gender situates knowing subjects. They originally
articulated three main approaches to this question: feminist
standpoint theory, feminist postmodernism, and feminist
empiricism. Conceptions of how gender situates knowers also inform
feminist approaches to the central problems of the field: grounding
feminist criticisms of science and feminist science, defining the
proper roles of social and political values in inquiry, evaluating
ideals of objectivity and rationality, and reforming structures of
epistemic authority.

Epistemology in Classical Indian Philosophy,0.7535454034805298,0.3304726481437683,"


Theory of knowledge,
pramāṇa-śāstra, is a rich genre of
Sanskrit literature, spanning almost twenty centuries, carried out in
texts belonging to distinct schools of philosophy. Debate across
school occurs especially on epistemological issues, but no author
writes on knowledge independently of the sort of metaphysical
commitment that defines the various classical systems
(darśana), realist and idealist, dualist and monist,
theist and atheist, and so on. And every one of the dozen or so major
schools from early in its history takes a position on knowledge and
justification, if only, as with the Buddhist skeptic
(Prasaṅgika), to attack the theories of others.  There
are nevertheless many common epistemological assumptions or attitudes,
the most striking of which is a focus on a belief's source in
questions of justification. Mainstream classical Indian epistemology
is dominated by theories about pedigree, i.e., views about
knowledge-generating processes, called
pramāṇa, “knowledge sources.” The
principal candidates are perception, inference, and testimony. Other
processes seem not truth-conducive or reducible to one or more of the
widely accepted sources such as perception and inference. However,
surprising candidates such as non-perception (for knowledge of
absences) and circumstantial implication (defended as distinct from
inference) provoke complex arguments especially in the later
texts—from about 1000 when the number of Sanskrit philosophical works
of some of the schools begins to proliferate almost exponentially. The
later texts present more intricate views and arguments than the earlier
from which the later authors learned. Classical Indian philosophy is an
unbroken tradition of reflection expressed in the pan-Subcontinent
intellectual language of Sanskrit. Or, we should say it is comprised of
interlocking traditions since there are the distinct schools,
all nevertheless using Sanskrit and engaging with the other schools.
Later authors expand and carry forward positions and arguments of their
predecessors.


Skepticism and the issue of whether knowledge that p
entails that you know that you know that p are addressed as
well as the question of the usefulness of knowledge not only for the
purposes of everyday life but also the religious goal of
world-transcendence, about which most schools take positions.
The authority of testimony, among the candidate sources, is considered
by some to have special religious importance. Others view yogic
perception and/or meditative experience as crucial for religious
knowledge, which is usually distinguished from the everyday knowledge analyzed
in the textbooks of epistemology.

Epistemology in Latin America,0.6124503016471863,0.5849950909614563,"

After presenting the current situation of epistemological research in
Latin America and part of its history, this entry will address five
topics: skepticism (especially in its Pyrrhonian stripe), core
epistemology, formal epistemology, Wittgenstein’s thought in
connection with epistemology and skepticism, and epistemology of law.
It should be noted from the outset that the entry does not purport to
provide a comprehensive account of epistemology in Latin America, but
rather to paint a general picture of it by focusing on the main issues
that have been discussed within that field.

We will take into consideration the work of those scholars who have
written (in Spanish, Portuguese, or English) on epistemological issues
independently of both whether they are currently based in Latin
America and whether they have worked in a non-Latin American country
for a considerable part of their careers. The touchstone for inclusion
was not whether they were born in Latin America—although all but
one of those who will be mentioned were born there—but whether
they are of Latin American origin, earned a degree from a Latin
American university, and worked for at least some time in Latin
America, thus receiving (part of) their philosophical education in
such a milieu. For this reason, there will be no mention of, e.g.,
Ernest Sosa’s and Linda Martín Alcoff’s extensive
and influential work in
 epistemology.[1]

Moral Epistemology,0.5438246130943298,0.6673055291175842,"


How is moral knowledge possible? This question is central in moral
epistemology and marks a cluster of problems. The most important are
the following.

Sociological: The best explanation of the depth of moral
disagreements and the social diversity that they reflect is one of two
things. (a) No moral facts exist to be known, since moral disagreements
exemplify merely clashes in moral sensibility rather than differences
about matters of fact. (b) Moral knowledge exists, but moral facts are
relative to the social group in which moral sensibility is formed with
the result that no moral truths are known to hold universally.
Psychological: Moral judgments are intrinsically motivating.
Judgments about matters of fact, on the other hand, are never
motivating just in themselves. Since to constitute moral knowledge a
moral judgment must be made about some moral fact, moral knowledge is
not possible.
Ontological: Moral knowledge is about moral reality. How is that
reality constituted? Three general possibilities present themselves.
(a) Moral reality might be theological in nature, pertaining to (say)
the will of God. (b) It might be a non-natural realm that is neither
theological nor natural, but sui generis. (c) It might be
comprehensible as a part of the natural world studied by science. Each
of these possibilities, however, is beset with difficulties, and no
viable fourth alternative has been conceived.
Evolutionary: Where do human morals come from? A familiar and
widely accepted answer is that human morals are in essence, despite
their modern variations, Darwinian adaptations. As such morals are
about survival and reproduction and have nothing to do with moral
truth. Moreover, while the intuitive, emotional basis of moral
judgments was useful to our ancestors, this basis is out-dated and
unreliable in modern industrial society and thus current moral thought
in such society, which inevitably embeds this basis, is without
rational foundation.
Methodological: Traditionally philosophers have sought to explain
the possibility of knowledge by appeal to at least some principles
that can be grasped and defended a priori and thus independently of
natural science. A new and revolutionary epistemology introduced by
Quine seeks to explain the possibility of knowledge through science
itself.  “Naturalized epistemology” has been immensely
popular since its inception in the 1960s, largely because it promises
to make epistemology consistent with a scientific world-view. At the
same time the new methodology appears to make it more difficult to
explain the possibility of moral knowledge. Two allied methodologies
that seek to find moral truth in a reflective equilibrium of judgments
or in applications of rational choice theory are much less restrictive
but open to the objection that they are morally conservative. A recent
methodology allied to naturalized epistemology is pragmatic
naturalism. Taking its inspiration from examples of transforming the
moral status quo, it is less vulnerable to the charge of moral
conservatism. However, by understanding moral knowledge as mainly a
matter of knowing how to live well interdependently with others by
resolving issues collectively as they arise, this methodology may not
offer a conception of moral truth appropriate to genuine moral
knowledge.
Moral: Feminists among others are often critical of traditional
epistemologies as well as the innovative recent methodologies on the
moral ground that the standards found there are unjustly biased
against women and other marginalized groups. For example, feminists
often reject the standard of impartiality contained in these forms of
epistemology because it renders invisible important knowledge
possessed by women and thereby contributes to their oppression. If,
for reasons to be given, the criticism has merit, then it presents an
apparent paradox within feminist moral epistemology, since it appears
to reject the ideal of impartiality on the ground that it is not
itself impartial. The Marxist complaint that the standard of
impartiality is unjustly biased against the working class because it
renders invisible their exploitation gives rise to the same
contradiction. Resolution of the paradox is important for both
evaluating such criticisms and understanding in general how to
evaluate moral criticisms of epistemic standards. 


Arguably, these issues, as central and broad as they are, do not cover
all of moral epistemology. To keep the subject manageable, this entry
is limited in the following five ways.


First, the entry ignores global skepticism, which doubts the
possibility of anyone's having any knowledge at all. Thus, it ignores
the threat of an unstoppable regress in justifications and Cartesian
evil demon scenarios. Nor does it take up the debates between
foundationalists and coherentists about the structure of
justification. These issues (with an exception to be noted) do not
raise problems special to moral epistemology. But see the entry for
Moral Skepticism.


Second, in keeping with the last restriction, the entry takes for granted
that our capacity to have other kinds of knowledge is not in question.
Indeed, the six problems above arise in part because of the
implications of having other kinds of knowledge.


Third, the entry assumes that moral knowledge entails (roughly)
justified true moral belief. This assumption commits me to the
position that moral knowledge is incompatible with non-cognitivism
(the view that moral claims lack cognitive value, such as
truth-value). A non-cognitivist, however, may seek to explain how the
attitudes or prescriptions expressed in moral claims are
justified. (See Hare 1981, Campbell 1985, Gibbard 1990, and Blackburn
1998 for theories of moral justification compatible with
non-cognitivism and the entry on
 moral skepticism
 for a discussion of moral justification in general.) Indeed, an
expressivist may invoke a deflationary conception of truth to support
the idea that we can speak of justified moral beliefs that are “true”
— without implying that justified moral beliefs accurately
represent moral reality. Moral justification is discussed below,
however, only as it pertains to putatively reliable representations of
moral reality.


Fourth, many important epistemological issues arise in the context of
considering specific normative theories or types of normative
theory. (Can virtue ethics explain how we can know what course of
action is morally acceptable for a situation demanding the exercise of
conflicting virtues?) The focus in this entry is on issues that are
special to moral epistemology but not tied to a particular type of
normative theory. The feminist criticism cited, though it arises from
specific normative concerns, is no exception, since it raises general
worries about how moral knowledge is possible.


Fifth, the discussion of the history of moral epistemology is limited
to philosophers, such as Kant and Hume, who have had the most to say
about these issues and whose responses have been most
influential. Other historical positions and additional analysis of the
possibility of a priori moral knowledge will be covered in other SEP
entries.

A Priorism in Moral Epistemology,0.5574393272399902,0.6471454501152039,"

A priori knowledge is, in an important sense, independent of
experience. If a proposition can be known a priori, then we
can somehow see that it is true just by thinking and reasoning about
it (see entry on
 a priori justification and knowledge).
 Here are some paradigm examples of propositions one can know a
priori:

(1) that all
bachelors are unmarried
(2)  that all three
sided plane figures will also have three angles
(3)  that 2 + 3 =
5.


Here are some paradigm examples of moral propositions:

(4)  that all murder is
wrong
(5)  that no
person’s good is any more important than the good of any other
person
(6)  that I ought to do
some volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity this
weekend.


Many philosophers think we can know some moral propositions a
priori. Few deny that we can know (4) a priori or the
proposition that if it would be wrong not to do something, one
ought to do it or other propositions that are obviously true
because of definitions. But some philosophers claim we can know more
significant moral propositions a priori.

On one familiar view, we can know a priori the fundamental
moral principle (or principles), e.g., the principle that one ought to
perform the action that has the overall best consequences, or the
principle that one ought to act in accordance with virtue, or whatever
the basic moral principle really is. Some hold we can know the
principle via analysis or because it defines the moral term it is
about. We can then know every day moral propositions about particular
actions or types of actions by inferring them from the fundamental
principle in conjunction with empirical facts.

However, some theorists claim we can know many more moral propositions
a priori, in particular, propositions that are not so closely
tied to the meaning or reference of moral terms. Others go farther,
claiming that most or all moral claims can be known a priori,
or even that moral claims can be known only a
priori.

In this entry, we clarify the concept of a priori knowledge
(and related concepts), as well as the relationship between a
priori knowledge and analyticity. We then review Kant’s
view of moral knowledge, early 20th century versions of
non-naturalism, late 20th century versions of naturalism,
particularism, and finally some 21st century versions of
intuitionism—all with an eye to the role they afford to a
priori knowledge.

Naturalism in Epistemology,0.7001325488090515,0.7319622039794922,"

Naturalism in epistemology, as elsewhere, has a long history. But it
is only relatively recently that it has gone by just that name and
received so much focused attention. As in other areas of philosophy,
questions concerning naturalism’s merits are central to recent
epistemological debate. While many epistemological theories and
positions are agreed by all to exemplify, or to run counter to,
naturalistic epistemology (NE), it is difficult to characterize
precisely, since “naturalism” is used to refer to a range
of positions, commitments, and so on. NE, then, is more a movement or
general approach to epistemological theorizing than it is some
substantive thesis (/theses). Broadly speaking, however, proponents of
NE take the attitude that there should be a close connection between
philosophical investigation—here, of such things as knowledge,
justification, rationality, etc.—and empirical
(“natural”) science. Beyond that, and as detailed below,
proponents of NE diverge in how they conceive of that close
connection, exactly—whether and to what extent they advocate use
of empirical methods, or insist upon the relevance of the
results of certain areas of empirical study, or invoke
certain recognized “natural” properties,
relations, and so on, in their accounts of certain central
epistemic phenomena. So too, proponents of NE differ in which
science(s) they take to be relevant to epistemological
theory—whether it is psychology and/or cognitive science,
ethology, cultural studies, evolutionary theory, social theory, or
some other area of empirical investigation.

NE can also be understood as an attempt to redress the perceived
shortcomings of what’s typically termed “traditional
epistemology”
 (TE).[1]
 Here too, different naturalists are motivated by different concerns.
TE is variously seen as unduly and unprofitably concerned with
skeptical worries; as too much the product of “armchair”
(perhaps a priori, and maybe ultimately idiosyncratic)
theorizing; as too geared towards the study of “our
concepts” of various states and properties and not concerned
enough with the epistemological phenomena themselves; as operating
without attention to the conditions in which knowledge (for example)
is actually produced and/or shared, the limits, contours and history
of actual human cognition, and so on. 

Given that the differences amongst naturalistic theories make it
difficult to give a precise characterization of NE, it is not
surprising that the division between NE and TE is itself something of
an idealization. Of course, just as there are clear instances where a
theory belongs on one or the other side of this divide, there
are some real differences between NE and TE broadly
understood. Nonetheless, many specific epistemological theories
incorporate elements of each, and so any neat bifurcation of extant
epistemologies into NE and TE is bound to sacrifice accuracy for
precision.

The discussion to follow describes some of the dominant claims,
commitments, and forms that naturalistic epistemology, so understood,
has taken, and specific examples of such naturalistic views. As well,
both the principal motivations for and the major objections to NE will
be discussed. Finally (and, in some cases, along the way), we will
briefly consider the relation between NE and some other recent and
important subjects, positions, and developments—some of them
just as controversial as NE itself. These include externalism,
experimental philosophy, social epistemology, feminist epistemology,
evolutionary epistemology, and debates about the nature of (epistemic)
rationality.

Reliabilism is an approach to epistemology that emphasizes the
truth-conduciveness of a belief-forming process, method, or other
epistemologically relevant factors. The reliability theme appears in
theories of knowledge, of justification, and of evidence.
“Reliabilism” is sometimes used broadly to refer to any
theory that emphasizes truth-getting or truth indicating
properties. More commonly it is used narrowly to refer to process
reliabilism about justification. This entry discusses reliabilism in

Until recently, epistemology—the study of knowledge and
justified belief—was heavily individualistic in focus. The
emphasis was on evaluating doxastic attitudes (beliefs and disbeliefs)
of individuals in abstraction from their social environment.  The
result is a distorted picture of the human epistemic situation, which
is largely shaped by social relationships and institutions. Social
epistemology seeks to redress this imbalance by investigating the
epistemic effects of social interactions and social systems. After
reviewing the history of the field in section 1, we provide a
three-part taxonomy for social epistemology in section 2. The first
part is concerned with inputs to individual doxastic decisions from
other people’s assertions and opinions.  The second part
investigates the epistemic features of collective doxastic agents,
such as courts and scientific panels. Finally, the third part studies
epistemic properties of social institutions and systems: how they
improve or impair epistemic outcomes for their individual members or
the systems as a whole. We offer overviews of these three types of
social epistemology in sections 3, 4 and 5 respectively.

Feminist Social Epistemology,0.6249951720237732,0.7199312448501587,"


Many of the significant contributors to the fast-developing field of
social epistemology have been feminist epistemologists, theorists who
investigate the role of gender in knowledge production. Motivated by
the political project of eliminating the oppression of women, feminist
epistemologists are interested in how the norms and practices of
knowledge production affect the lives of women and are implicated in
systems of oppression. Feminist epistemologists seek to understand not
only how our social relations of gender have shaped our
knowledge practices, but also whether and how these relations
should play a role in good knowing. Feminists have
distinguished between the categories of gender and (anatomical) sex,
and for decades have focused much of their attention on gender, the analytical
category capturing the cultural and social aspects of sexed
 bodies.[1]
As a category of social relations then, gender is a significant area
of investigation for social epistemology. Additionally, feminist
epistemologists have increasingly attended to the interrelations
between gender and other social categories such as race and ethnicity,
class, sexuality, ability status, and global location, investigating
their significance for knowledge.


Elizabeth Anderson characterizes feminist epistemology as properly
belonging within social epistemology, describing it as “the branch of
social epistemology that investigates the influence of socially
constructed conceptions and norms of gender and gender-specific
interests and experiences on the production of knowledge”(1995a,
54). It may be too strong a claim to suggest that all projects of
feminist epistemology fall within the realm of social epistemology; it
could be argued that some projects of feminist epistemology, such as
Louise Antony’s defense of epistemological individualism (1995),
resist at least certain elements of a social epistemology. Similarly,
theorists who argue that there are epistemically valuable feminine
ways of knowing integral to women, without providing a social
analysis, could also be viewed as resisting certain elements of a
social epistemology.[2]
 Nevertheless, by far the majority of work in feminist epistemology is
best understood as a form of social epistemology.


Feminist social epistemology represents more than just a small subset
of social epistemology, however. The significant body of work of
feminist social epistemologists has provided key theoretical resources
for understanding the breadth and depth of the social dimensions of
knowing. The interest of feminist social epistemologists in how gender
plays out in knowledge practices is generalizable to an interest in
how power relations play out epistemically, especially systematic
relations of power. Their focus on power relations has led some to
characterize feminist social epistemologists as falling on the radical
end of the social epistemology spectrum (Goldman 2001; Kitcher
1994). Radical or not, few feminist epistemologists reduce knowledge
to power politics, even as they draw attention to them. One of the key
features of feminist epistemologies responsible for some of their
significant contributions within social epistemology has been their
serious commitment to developing normative epistemological
accounts. 


Social epistemology distinguishes itself from sociology of knowledge
in its goal of providing a normative analysis of knowledge (Fuller
1988; Schmitt 1994a), seeking not only to describe our current social
practices of knowledge production, but also to understand how we ought
to know and how we can improve our knowledge practices. There is
little agreement among social epistemologists on the scope or form of
such normativity. However, feminist social epistemologists have felt
this need to incorporate a normative dimension to their social
analyses in a particularly pressing way: feminist political demands
for the elimination of oppression are normative in a moral sense, but
they also depend on epistemically normative claims for their
justification. Their force depends on the ability to distinguish
between better and worse claims to knowledge, for example by
criticizing sexist knowledge claims and supporting non-sexist
knowledge claims. Feminists can ill afford to simply describe the ways
in which social relations such as gender currently shape knowledge
practices if they are to defend their claims for social change. Thus,
feminist social epistemologists have a particularly strong motivation
to develop rich accounts that tease epistemic normativity out of a
power-sensitive social understanding of knowledge production.


As is true of social epistemology as a whole, there is a great deal of
variation in the theories and approaches constituting feminist
epistemology and few generalizations can be made across the field.
Acknowledging such variety, some theorists refer only to “feminist
epistemologies” in the plural, fearing that characterizing a single
field of feminist epistemology implies a greater unity than exists.
Others have argued that feminist epistemology should best be
identified not by its specific theoretical content, but rather by what
“doing epistemology as a feminist” amounts to (Longino 1999). Doing
epistemology as a feminist involves bringing one’s feminist concerns
and sensibilities to the epistemological table. As a result of
bringing such concerns to epistemological work, significant feminist
contributions to social epistemology have included extensive critiques
of the individualism of contemporary analytic epistemology, the
development of alternative models of knowers as social beings,
defenses of the appropriate role of values and other culturally
relative factors in knowing, the development of socially informed
conceptions of objectivity, analyses of the challenges of knowing
under social conditions of oppression, and analyses of the epistemic
benefits of social justice and democratic institutions.

Virtue Epistemology,0.7190529704093933,0.730586588382721,"

Contemporary virtue epistemology (hereafter ‘VE’) is a
diverse collection of approaches to epistemology. At least two central
tendencies are discernible among the approaches. First, they view
epistemology as a normative discipline. Second, they view intellectual
agents and communities as the primary focus of epistemic evaluation,
with a focus on the intellectual virtues and vices embodied in and
expressed by these agents and communities.

This entry introduces many of the most important results of the
contemporary VE research program. These include novel attempts to
resolve longstanding disputes, solve perennial problems, grapple with
novel challenges, and expand epistemology’s horizons. In the
process, it reveals the diversity within VE. Beyond sharing the two
unifying commitments mentioned above, its practitioners diverge over
the nature of intellectual virtues, which questions to ask, and which
methods to use.

It will be helpful to note some terminology before proceeding. First,
we use ‘cognitive’, ‘epistemic’ and
‘intellectual’ synonymously. Second, we often use
‘normative’ broadly to include not only norms and rules,
but also duties and values. Finally, ‘practitioners’ names
contemporary virtue epistemologists.

Formal Epistemology,0.7696017026901245,0.8221500515937805,"
Formal epistemology explores knowledge and reasoning using
“formal” tools, tools from math and logic. For example, a
formal epistemologist might use probability theory to explain how
scientific reasoning works. Or she might use modal logic to defend a
particular theory of knowledge.
The questions that drive formal epistemology are often the same as
those that drive “informal” epistemology. What is
knowledge, and how is it different from mere opinion? What separates
science from pseudoscience? When is a belief justified? What justifies
my belief that the sun will rise tomorrow, or that the external world
is real and not an illusion induced by Descartes’ demon?
And yet, the tools formal epistemologists apply to these questions
share much history and interest with other fields, both inside and
outside philosophy. So formal epistemologists often ask questions that
aren’t part of the usual epistemological core, questions about
 decision-making (§5.1) or the meaning of
 hypothetical language (§5.3), for example.
Perhaps the best way to get a feel for formal epistemology is to
look at concrete examples. We’ll take a few classic epistemological
questions and look at popular formal approaches to them, to see what
formal tools bring to the table. We’ll also look at some applications
of these formal methods outside epistemology.

The Epsilon Calculus,0.8896525502204895,0.7183880805969238,"


The epsilon calculus is a logical formalism developed by David
Hilbert in the service of his program in the foundations of
mathematics. The epsilon operator is a term-forming operator which
replaces quantifiers in ordinary predicate logic. Specifically, in the
calculus, a term εx A denotes some x
satisfying A(x), if there is one. In Hilbert's
Program, the epsilon terms play the role of ideal elements; the aim of
Hilbert's finitistic consistency proofs is to give a procedure which
removes such terms from a formal proof. The procedures by which this is
to be carried out are based on Hilbert's epsilon substitution method.
The epsilon calculus, however, has applications in other contexts as
well. The first general application of the epsilon calculus was in
Hilbert's epsilon theorems, which in turn provide the basis for the
first correct proof of Herbrand's theorem. More recently, variants of
the epsilon operator have been applied in linguistics and linguistic
philosophy to deal with anaphoric pronouns.

This article is concerned with social and political equality. In its
prescriptive usage, ‘equality’ is a loaded and
‘highly contested’ concept. On account of its normally
positive connotation, it has a rhetorical power rendering it suitable
as a political slogan (Westen 1990). At least since the French
Revolution, equality has served as one of the leading ideals of the
body politic; in this respect, it is at present probably the most
controversial of the great social ideals. There is controversy
concerning the precise notion of equality, the relation of justice and
equality (the principles of equality), the material requirements and
measure of the ideal of equality (equality of what?), the extension of
equality (equality among whom?), and its status within a comprehensive
(liberal) theory of justice (the value of equality). Each of these five
issues will be discussed by turn in the present article.

Equality of Educational Opportunity,0.4878827035427094,0.7550491690635681,"

It is widely accepted that educational opportunities for children
ought to be equal. This thesis follows from two observations about
education and children: first, that education significantly influences
a person’s life chances in terms of labor market success,
preparation for democratic citizenship, and general human flourishing;
and second, that children’s life chances should not be fixed by
certain morally arbitrary circumstances of their birth such as their
social class, race, and gender. But the precise meaning of, and
implications for, the ideal of equality of educational opportunity is
the subject of substantial disagreement (see Jencks 1988). This entry
provides a critical review of the nature and basis of those
disagreements.

To frame the discussion we introduce three key factors that underscore
the importance of treating equality of educational opportunity as an
independent concern, apart from theories of equality of opportunity
more generally. These factors are: the central place of education in
modern societies and the myriad opportunities it affords; the scarcity
of high-quality educational opportunities for many children; and the
critical role of the state in providing educational opportunities.
These factors differentiate education from many other social goods. We
follow this with a brief history of how equality of educational
opportunity has been interpreted in the United States since the 1950s
and the evolving legal understandings of equality of opportunity. Our
subsequent analysis has implications for issues that are at the center
of current litigation in the United States. But our philosophical
discussion is intended to have wider reach, attempting to clarify the
most attractive competing conceptions of the concept.

Equality of Opportunity,0.4836425185203552,0.7521306872367859,"

Equality of opportunity is a political ideal that is opposed to caste
hierarchy but not to hierarchy per se. The background
assumption is that a society contains a hierarchy of more and less
desirable, superior and inferior positions. Or there may be several
such hierarchies. In a caste society, the assignment of individuals to
places in the social hierarchy is fixed by birth. The child acquires
the social status of his or her parents at least if their union is
socially sanctioned. Social mobility may be possible in a caste
society, but the process whereby one is admitted to a different level
of the hierarchy is open only to some individuals depending on their
initial ascriptive social status. In contrast, when equality of
opportunity prevails, the assignment of individuals to places in the
social hierarchy is determined by some form of competitive process,
and all members of society are eligible to compete on equal terms.
Different conceptions of equality of opportunity construe this idea of
competing on equal terms variously.

The Equivalence of Mass and Energy,0.8627972602844238,0.3483467996120453,"


Einstein correctly described the equivalence of mass and energy as
“the most important upshot of the special theory of
relativity” (Einstein, 1919), for this result lies at the core of
modern physics. According to Einstein's famous equation
E = mc2, the energy E
of a physical system is numerically equal to the product of its mass
m and the speed of light c squared. It is customary
to refer to this result as “the equivalence of mass and
energy,” or simply “mass-energy equivalence,” because
one can choose units in which c = 1, and hence E =
m.


The two main philosophical questions surrounding Einstein's equation
concern how we ought to understand the assertion that mass and energy
are in some sense equivalent and how we ought to understand
assertions concerning the convertibility of mass into energy (or vice
versa).


In this entry, we first discuss the physics
E = mc2 and its application

 In
 Section 2,
 we identify
six distinct, though related, philosophical interpretations of
Einstein's equation. We then discuss, in

the history of derivations of
E = mc2 and its philosophical
importance. Finally, in

account of the empirical confirmation of Einstein's equation that
focuses on Cockcroft and Walton's (1932) first confirmation of
mass-energy equivalence and a very recent, and very accurate
confirmation by Rainville et al. (2005).

Desiderius Erasmus,0.5367495417594911,0.21957293152809146,"

Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam (1467?–1536) was not a
systematic philosopher although we discern in the large body of his
writings a certain Erasmian habit of mind. He often reflected on
subjects that invite philosophical inquiry: the influence of nature
versus nurture, the relationship between word and thing, the ideal
form of government, the nature of faith, and the theory of knowledge.
Erasmus’ views on these subjects are of interest to historians
today, even if they are unstructured, because his works circulated
widely and his influence in Northern Europe was pervasive. In modern
parlance, he was an opinion maker. If a general label is needed,
Erasmus’ thought is best described as “Christian
Humanism”, that is, a philosophy of life combining Christian
thought with classical traditions. He embraced the humanistic belief
in an individual’s capacity for self-improvement and the
fundamental role of education in raising human beings above the level
of brute animals. The thrust of Erasmus’ educational programme
was the promotion of docta pietas, learned piety, or what he
termed the “philosophy of Christ”. As a biblical scholar
he supported the humanistic call Ad fontes, a return to the
texts in the original language and therefore promoted the study of the
biblical languages Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. He was in the vanguard of
modern philology. His pioneering edition of the Greek New Testament
shows that he had an understanding of the process of textual
transmission and had developed text-critical principles. In politics,
Erasmus embraced consensus, compromise, and peaceful cooperation,
ideals he recommended to the participants in the Reformation debate,
albeit with little success. Considered a forerunner of the Reformation
by his contemporaries, he broke with Martin Luther over the
latter’s sectarianism. More fundamentally, the two men disagreed
over heuristics and engaged in a polemic over the question of free
will. Erasmus took a skeptical position vis-à-vis
Luther’s assertions. Unlike the reformer, he did not believe in
the clarity of Scripture and used consensus and tradition as criteria
to settle questions that did not allow a rational conclusion. Erasmus
rarely ventured into doctrinal questions, however, favoring simple
faith and devotion over dialectics and scholastic speculation. The
circulation of Erasmus’ works was temporarily curtailed when the
Catholic Church put them on the Index of Forbidden Books, but his
ideas saw a revival during the Enlightenment when he was regarded as a
forerunner of rationalism. His most famous work, The Praise of
Folly, has remained in print to the present day, a distinction
shared by few books from the 16th century.

John Scottus Eriugena,0.6752253770828247,0.18347659707069397,"


Johannes (c.800 - c.877), who signed himself as
‘Eriugena’ in one manuscript, and who was referred to by
his contemporaries as ‘the Irishman’ (scottus
— in the 9th century Ireland was referred to as
‘Scotia Maior’ and its inhabitants as
‘scotti’) is the most significant Irish
intellectual of the early monastic period. He is generally recognized
to be both the outstanding philosopher (in terms of originality) of the
Carolingian era and of the whole period of Latin philosophy stretching
from Boethius to Anselm. Eriugena is also, though this parallel remains
to be explored, more or less a contemporary of the Arab Neoplatonist
Al-Kindi. Since the seventeenth century, it has become usual to refer
to this Irish philosopher as John Scottus (or ‘Scotus’)
Eriugena to distinguish him from the thirteenth-century John Duns
Scotus.


Eriugena's uniqueness lies in the fact that, quite remarkably for a
scholar in Western Europe in the Carolingian era, he had considerable
familiarity with the Greek language, affording him access to the Greek
Christian theological tradition, from the Cappadocians to Gregory of
Nyssa, hitherto almost entirely unknown in the Latin West. He also
produced a complete, if somewhat imperfect, Latin translation of the
Corpus Dionysii, the works of the obscure, possibly Syrian,
Christian Neoplatonist, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a follower of
Proclus. In addition, Eriugena translated Gregory of Nyssa’s
De hominis opificio and Maximus Confessor's Ambigua ad
Iohannem, and possibly other works, such as Epiphanius'
Anchoratus.


Eriugena's thought is best understood as a sustained attempt to
create a consistent, systematic, Christian Neoplatonism from diverse
but primarily Christian sources. Eriugena had a unique gift for
identifying the underlying intellectual framework, broadly Neoplatonic
but also deeply Christian, assumed by the writers of the Christian
East. Drawing especially on Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Pseudo-Dionysius
the Areopagite, Maximus Confessor, as well as on the more familiar
authorities (auctores) of the Latin West (e.g. Cicero,
Martianus Capella, Augustine, Boethius), he developed a highly original
cosmology, where the highest principle, the ‘the immovable
self-identical one’ (unum et idipsum immobile,
Periphyseon, Patrologia Latina CXXII I. 476b),
engenders all things and retrieves them back into itself. Contrary to
what some earlier commentators supposed, it is most unlikely that
Eriugena had direct knowledge of the original texts of Plotinus,
Porphyry, Proclus, or other pagan Neoplatonists, but he did have some
direct knowledge of Plato (a portion of Timaeus in the
translation of Calcidius) as well as familiarity with the
pseudo-Augustinian Categoriae decem.


Overall, Eriugena develops a Neoplatonic cosmology according to
which the infinite, transcendent and ‘unknown’ God, who is
beyond being and non-being, through a process of self-articulation,
procession, or ‘self-creation’, proceeds from his divine
‘darkness’ or ‘non-being’ into the light of
being, speaking the Word who is understood as Christ, and at the same
timeless moment bringing forth the Primary Causes of all creation.
These causes in turn proceed into their Created Effects and as such are
creatures entirely dependent on, and will ultimately return to, their
sources, which are the Causes or Ideas in God. These Causes, considered
as diverse and infinite in themselves, are actually one single
principle in the divine One. The whole of reality or nature, then, is
involved in a dynamic process of outgoing (exitus) from and
return (reditus) to the One. God is the One or the Good or the
highest principle, which transcends all, and which therefore may be
said to be ‘the non-being that transcends being’. In an
original departure from traditional Neoplatonism, in his dialogue
Periphyseon, this first and highest cosmic principle is called
‘nature’ (natura) and is said to include both God
and creation.


Nature is defined as universitas rerum, the ‘totality
of all things’, and includes both the things which are (ea
quae sunt) as well as those which are not (ea quae non
sunt). This divine nature may be divided into a set of four
‘species’ or ‘divisions’ (divisiones)
which nevertheless retain their unity with their source. These four
divisions of nature taken together are to be understood as God,
presented as the ‘Beginning, Middle and End of all
things’.


Apart from having a minor influence in France in the ninth century,
Eriugena's cosmological speculations appear too conceptually advanced
for the philosophers and theologians of his time, and his philosophical
system was generally neglected in the tenth and eleventh centuries. His
main work, Periphyseon, was revived by twelfth-century
Neoplatonists, and also circulated in a compendium, Clavis
Physicae [The Key of Nature] of Honorius Augustodunensis. The
Periphyseon was popular among the philosophers of Chartres and
St. Victor (e.g. Hugh of St. Victor refers to it) but was condemned in
the thirteenth century, alongside the writings of David of Dinant and
Amaury of Bène, for promoting the identity of God and creation.
In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Eriugena continued to have a
relatively clandestine but still important influence on Christian
Neoplatonists such as Meister Eckhart and especially Nicholas of Cusa.
The first printed editions of his works appeared in the seventeenth
century, but it was not until the nineteenth century that interest in
him was revived, especially among followers of Hegel who saw Eriugena
as a forerunner to speculative idealism, as a ‘Proclus of the
West’ (Hauréau) and the ‘Father of Speculative
Philosophy’ (Huber). The first truly scholarly attempt to
establish the facts of his life, his works and influence was by the
Belgian scholar Maiul Cappuyns, whose 1933 work Jean Scot
Erigène: sa vie, son oeuvre, sa pensée is still
reliable. Many valuable twentieth-century studies (e.g. Contreni,
Marenbon, Schrimpf, O’Meara) have explored Eriugena’s
Carolingian background and continuity with Latin authors. However,
systematic studies of his thought (Beierwaltes, Gersh, Moran) have also
recognized him as a highly original metaphysician and speculative
thinker of the first rank whose work transcends the limitations of his
age and mode of expression.

Locke on Real Essence,0.571048378944397,0.3551006317138672,"


The technical term ‘real essence’ is introduced into the
philosophical lexicon by the English philosopher John Locke
(1632–1704) in his An Essay Concerning Human
Understanding[1] 
 (hereafter “Essay”)
that was first published in London, in December of 1689. In order to
understand a great many of Locke’s arguments in Books III and IV of
the Essay, it is important to understand what a real essence
is. Thus, the purpose of this entry is to explain the various
interpretations of ‘real essence’ that are in the current
literature.  Another reason why this matters is that the concept of
‘real essence’ (or variations of it) has been at the
center of much of the philosophical debate over natural kind realism
since the time of Locke, so some of this entry can serve as an
historical introduction to that debate as well.


Very simply stated, a real essence, for Locke, is what makes
something what it is, and in the case of physical substances, it is the
underlying physical cause of the object’s observable qualities
(unless otherwise noted, we shall confine our discussion in this
article to the real essences of material substances). A nominal
essence, on the other hand, is an abstract idea that we make when we
identify similar qualities shared by objects; the nominal essence is
the idea of those shared similarities. The distinction between
real and nominal essences plays an important semantic role in Book III
and an important epistemological role in Book IV of the
Essay. The semantic role will be discussed more below,
but in a nutshell, Locke argues in Book III that words have meaning
only insofar as we can attach ideas to them. Since nominal
essences are the abstract ideas we use to name and distinguish the
species or genera of things, the meanings of our species or genera
terms just are abstract ideas. For example, a common idea of
penguins is of short, black and white flightless waterfowl. That
abstract idea is the meaning of the word ‘penguin’.
By contrast, Locke goes on to argue, we have no ideas of real essences
and so our species or genus terms refer to the nominal essences, not to
the real essences (II.xxxi.6; citations to Locke’s
Essay are given as book, chapter, section; so Book II, chapter
xxxi, section 6 is given as “II.xxxi.6”).


Regarding knowledge, in Book IV Locke argues that knowledge is real
only if our ideas correspond to their archetypes in the appropriate
way. Scientific knowledge occurs when our nominal essence ideas
match the real essences. According to Locke, in mathematics
and morality the nominal and real essences are the same. That is,
the definitions of mathematical or moral concepts constitute both the
nominal and real essences of those concepts. For that reason it
is possible to have a human science of mathematics and morality.
In the case of substances, however, the real and nominal essences are
always different, and so there is no possible human science of
substances (IV.vi.12–16).

Eternity in Christian Thought,0.7199646234512329,0.5890140533447266,"

The term “eternity” plays a key role in discussions about
how the God of Western theism relates to time. These discussions have
a long and venerable history. They are also of lively contemporary
interest.

The reason for this long-standing and continued interest is
straightforward. How one sees God’s relationship to time has
repercussions throughout philosophy of religion and philosophical
theology. How much and in what ways does God’s relationship to
time, and thus his nature, differ from ours? How much can meaningfully
be said about what God is like, as opposed to how God is not? How, if
at all, can an unchanging God interact with the world, affect history,
or respond to petitionary prayer? And even, how should one think of
the relation between science and theistic religion; can empirical
findings (dis-) confirm theism? Thus, a conception of how God relates
to time is a defining element of any conception of God.

This entry provides an overview of some key positions on God and time
and discusses arguments for and against divine timelessness. The final
section outlines some other philosophical contexts in which
the concept of eternity can play a role.

purpose is to create goods and services for sale, usually at a profit.
Business is also an activity. One entity (e.g., a person, an
organization) “does business” with another when it
exchanges a good or service for valuable consideration. Business
ethics can thus be understood as the study of the ethical dimensions
of productive organizations and commercial activities. This includes
ethical analyses of the production, distribution, marketing, sale, and
consumption of goods and services (see also Donaldson & Walsh
2015).

Questions in business ethics are important and relevant to everyone.
This is because almost all of us “do business”—i.e.,
engage in a commercial transaction—almost every day. Moreover,
many of us spend a major portion of our lives engaged in, or preparing
to engage in, productive activity, on our own or as part of productive
organizations. Business activity shapes the world we live in,
sometimes for good and sometimes for ill.

Business ethics is a huge field. Philosophers from Aristotle to Rawls
have defended positions on topics which can be understood as part of
business ethics. At present, there are at least five journals devoted
to the field (Business Ethics Quarterly, Business Ethics:
A European Review, Business & Society, Business & Society
Review, Journal of Business Ethics), and work in business ethics
appears in mainstream philosophy and social science journals as
well.

This entry summarizes important research on central questions in
business ethics, including: In whose interests should firms be
managed? Who should manage them? What do firms owe their workers, and
what do workers owe their firms? What moral rules should guide
firms’ engagement with customers? Should firms try to solve
social problems? What responsibility do they have for the behavior of
their suppliers? What role should firms play in the political process?
Given the vastness of the field, of necessity certain questions in
business ethics are not addressed here.

Environmental ethics is the discipline in philosophy that studies the
moral relationship of human beings to, and also the value and moral
status of, the environment and its non-human contents. This entry
covers: (1) the challenge of environmental ethics to the
anthropocentrism (i.e., human-centeredness) embedded in traditional
western ethical thinking; (2) the early development of the discipline
in the 1960s and 1970s; (3) the connection of deep ecology, feminist
environmental ethics, animism and social ecology to politics; (4) the
attempt to apply traditional ethical theories, including
consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics, to support
contemporary environmental concerns; (5) the preservation of
biodiversity as an ethical goal; (6) the broader concerns of some
thinkers with wilderness, the built environment and the politics of
poverty; (7) the ethics of sustainability and climate change, and (8)
some directions for possible future developments of the

Feminist Ethics,0.6029168963432312,0.6872946619987488,"

Feminist Ethics is an attempt to revise, reformulate, or
rethink traditional ethics to the extent it depreciates or devalues
women's moral experience. Among others, feminist philosopher Alison
Jaggar faults traditional ethics for letting women down in five
related ways. First, it shows less concern for women's as opposed to
men's issues and interests. Second, traditional ethics views as
trivial the moral issues that arise in the so-called private world,
the realm in which women do housework and take care of children, the
infirm, and the elderly. Third, it implies that, in general, women are
not as morally mature or deep as men. Fourth, traditional ethics
overrates culturally masculine traits like “independence,
autonomy, intellect, will, wariness, hierarchy, domination, culture,
transcendence, product, asceticism, war, and death,” while it
underrates culturally feminine traits like “interdependence,
community, connection, sharing, emotion, body, trust, absence of
hierarchy, nature, immanence, process, joy, peace, and life.”
Fifth, and finally, it favors “male” ways of moral
reasoning that emphasize rules, rights, universality, and impartiality
over “female” ways of moral reasoning that emphasize
relationships, responsibilities, particularity, and partiality
(Jaggar, “Feminist Ethics,” 1992). 


Feminists have developed a wide variety of gender-centered approaches
to ethics, each of which addresses one or more of the five ways
traditional ethics has failed or neglected women. Some feminist
ethicists emphasize issues related to women's traits and behaviors,
particularly their care-giving ones. In contrast, other feminist
ethicists emphasize the political, legal, economic, and/or ideological
causes and effects of women's second-sex status. But be these emphases
as they may, all feminist ethicists share the same goal: the creation
of a gendered ethics that aims to eliminate or at least ameliorate the
oppression of any group of people, but most particularly women
(Jaggar, “Feminist Ethics,” 1992).

Internet Research Ethics,0.5314143896102905,0.8972605466842651,"

There is little research that is not impacted in some way on or
through the Internet. The Internet, as a field, a tool, and a venue,
has specific and far reaching ethical issues. Internet research ethics
is a subdiscipline that fits across many disciplines, ranging from
social sciences, arts and humanities, medical/biomedical, and hard
sciences. Extant ethical frameworks, including
 consequentialism,
 utilitarianism,
 deontology,
 virtue ethics, and
 feminist ethics
 have contributed to the
ways in which ethical issues in Internet research are considered and
evaluated.

Conceptually and historically, Internet research ethics is related to
computer and information ethics

and includes such ethical issues as participant knowledge and consent,
data privacy, security, confidentiality, and integrity of data,
intellectual property issues, and community, disciplinary, and
professional standards or norms. Throughout the Internet’s evolution,
there has been debate whether there are new ethical dilemmas emerging,
or if the existing dilemmas are similar to dilemmas in other research
realms or despite technological influence (Elgesem 2002; Walther 2002;
Ess & AoIR 2002; Marhkam & Buchanan, 2012). These debates are
similar to philosophical debates in computer and information
ethics. For example, many years ago, James Moor (1985) asked
“what is special about computers” in order to understand
what, if anything, is unique ethically. Today, the same question
applies to Internet research (Ess & AoIR 2002; King 1996).

Yet, as the Internet has evolved into a more social and communicative
tool and venue, the ethical issues have shifted from purely data
driven to more human-centered. “On-ground” or face-to-face
analogies, however, may not be applicable to online research. For
example, the concept of the public park has been used as a site where
researchers might observe others with little ethical controversy, but
online, the concepts of public versus private are much more
complex. Thus, some scholars suggest that the specificity of Internet
research ethics calls for new regulatory and/or professional and
disciplinary guidance. For these reasons, the concept of human
subjects research policy and regulation informs this entry, along with
disciplinary standards, which will explore the growing areas of
ethical and methodological complexity, including personal
identifiability, reputational risk and harm, notions of public space
and public text, ownership, and longevity of data as they relate to
Internet research. Specifically, the emergence of the social web
raises issues around subject or participant recruitment practices,
tiered informed consent models, and protection of various expectations
and forms of privacy in an ever-increasing world of diffused and
ubiquitous technologies; anonymity and confidentiality of data in
spaces where researchers and their subjects may not fully understand
the terms and conditions of those venues or tools; challenges to data
integrity as research projects can be outsourced or crowdsourced to
online labor marketplaces; and jurisdictional issues as more research
is processed, stored, and disseminated via cloud computing or in
remote server locales, presenting myriad legal complexities given
jurisdictional differences in data laws. Further, the emergence of big
data research has grown and has become the next discrete phase of
Internet research, following social media and social computing. 

As a result, researchers using the Internet as a tool for and/or a
space of research—and their research ethics boards (REBs), also
known as institutional review boards (IRBs) in the United States or
human research ethics committees (HRECs) in other countries such as
Australia—have been confronted with a series of new ethical
questions: What ethical obligations do researchers have to protect the
privacy of subjects engaging in activities in “public”
Internet spaces? What are such public spaces? Is there any reasonable
expectation of privacy in an era of pervasive and ubiquitous
surveillance and data tracking? How is confidentiality or anonymity
assured online? How is and should informed consent be obtained online?
How should research on minors be conducted, and how do you prove a
subject is not a minor? Is deception (pretending to be someone you are
not, withholding identifiable information, etc) online a norm or a
harm? How is “harm” possible to someone existing in an
online space? How identifiable are individuals in large data sets? Do
human subjects protections apply to big data? As more
industry-sponsored research takes place, what ethical protections
exist outside of current regulatory structures?

A growing number of scholars have explored these and related questions
(see, for example, Bromseth 2002; Bruckman 2006; Buchanan 2004;
Buchanan & Ess 2008; Johns, Chen & Hall
2003; Kitchin 2003, 2008; King 1996; Mann 2003; Markham & Baym
2008; McKee & Porter 2009; Thorseth 2003; Ess 2016; Zimmer &
Kinder-Kurlanda, forthcoming), scholarly associations have drafted
ethical guidelines for Internet research (Ess & Association of
Internet Researchers 2002; Markham, Buchanan, and AoIR, 2012; Kraut et
al. 2004), and non-profit scholarly and scientific agencies such as
AAAS (Frankel & Siang 1999) have begun to confront the myriad of
ethical concerns that Internet research poses to researchers and
research ethics boards (REBs).

The Natural Law Tradition in Ethics,0.5257922410964966,0.6002545952796936,"


‘Natural law theory’ is a label that has been applied to
theories of ethics, theories of politics, theories of civil law, and
theories of religious morality. We will be concerned only with natural
law theories of ethics: while such views arguably have some interesting
implications for law, politics, and religious morality, these
implications will not be our focus here.


This article has two central objectives. First, it aims to identify
the defining features of natural law moral theory. Second, it
aims to identify some of the main theoretical options that natural law
theorists face in formulating a precise view within the constraints set
by these defining features and some of the difficulties for each of
these options. It will not, however, attempt to recount the history of
the development of natural law thought. (For a very helpful
detailed history of natural law thought up to the beginning of the
modern period, see Crowe 1977. For a very helpful detailed history of
natural law thought in the modern period, see Haakonssen 1996. For an
article-length recap of the entire history of natural law thought, see

Personal Identity and Ethics,0.7532531619071959,0.5344805717468262,"


What justifies our holding one person over another morally responsible for a past
action? Why am I justified in having a special prudential concern for
one particular future person over all others? Why do many of us think that 
maximizing the good within a single life is perfectly acceptable, but
maximizing the good across lives is wrong? For these and other 
normative questions, it looks like any answer we come up with will 
have to make essential reference to personal identity. So, for 
instance, it seems we are justified in holding X responsible
for some past action only if X is identical to the person 
who performed that action. Further, it seems I am justified in my 
special concern for some future person only if he will be me. 
Finally, many of us think that while maximization within a life 
affects only one person, a metaphysical unity, maximization across 
lives affects many different, metaphysically distinct, persons, and 
so the latter is wrong insofar as it ignores this fundamental 
separateness of persons.


These are among the many issues relevant to an investigation into the
relation between personal identity and ethics. “Ethics”
here is broadly construed to be about the way(s) in which we ought to
live our lives, and so it includes both self-regarding and
other-regarding practical concerns. Among the self-regarding concerns
for which personal identity seems relevant are those about the nature
and grounds of survival and immortality, rational anticipation,
advance directives, and general prudential concern. Among the
other-regarding concerns for which personal identity seems relevant
are those about the nature and grounds of moral responsibility,
compensation, interpersonal moral relations, abortion and embryonic
research, population ethics, and therapeutic treatments for
dissociative identity disorders. A leading approach to exploring the
relation between identity and ethics, then, is to start with an
investigation into the nature of personal identity and see how
conclusions in that metaphysical realm might apply to these sorts of
practical concerns. After starting with a brief discussion of notable
historical accounts taking this approach, we will do so as well,
surveying the main theories of personal identity on offer and then
seeing what, if anything, they might imply for several self-regarding
and other-regarding ethical concerns. We will then turn to discuss
several new approaches to discovering the relation between personal
identity and ethics, alternatives that have breathed fresh life into
the debate.

Social Networking and Ethics,0.5419826507568359,0.88456791639328,"


In the first decade of the 21st century, new media
technologies for social networking such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter
and YouTube began to transform the social, political and informational
practices of individuals and institutions across the globe, inviting a
philosophical response from the community of applied ethicists and
philosophers of technology. While this scholarly response continues to
be challenged by the rapidly evolving nature of social networking
technologies, the urgent need for attention to this phenomenon is
underscored by the fact that it is reshaping how many human beings initiate
and/or maintain virtually every type of ethically significant social
bond or role: friend-to-friend, parent-to-child, co-worker-to
co-worker, employer-to-employee, teacher-to-student,
neighbor-to-neighbor, seller-to-buyer, and doctor-to-patient, to offer
just a partial list. Nor are the ethical implications of these
technologies strictly interpersonal. The complex web of interactions
between social networking service users and their online and offline
communities, social network developers, corporations, governments and
other institutions—along with the diverse and sometimes
conflicting motives and interests of these various stakeholders—will
continue to require rigorous philosophical analysis for decades to
come.


Section 1 of the entry outlines the history and working definition
of social networking services (hereafter referred to as SNS). Section 2
identifies the early philosophical foundations of reflection on the
ethics of online social networks, leading up to the emergence of Web
2.0 standards (supporting user interactions) and full-fledged SNS.
Section 3 reviews the primary ethical topic areas around which
philosophical reflections on SNS have, to date, converged: privacy;
identity and community; friendship, virtue and the good life; democracy
and the public sphere; and cybercrime. Finally, Section 4 reviews some
of the metaethical issues potentially impacted by the emergence of
SNS.

Thick Ethical Concepts,0.6062126159667969,0.8304477334022522,"

Evaluative terms and concepts are often divided into
“thin” and “thick”. We don’t evaluate
actions and persons merely as good or bad, or right or wrong, but also
as kind, courageous, tactful, selfish, boorish, and cruel. The latter
are examples of thick concepts, the general class of which includes
virtue and vice concepts such as generous and
selfish, practical concepts such as shrewd
and imprudent,
epistemic concepts such as open-minded and
gullible, and aesthetic concepts such as banal
and gracious. These
concepts stand in an intuitive contrast to those we typically express
when we use thin terms such as right, bad,
permissible, and ought. (Concepts are often regarded
as non-linguistic representational items that can serve as the
meanings of linguistic expressions and as constituents of
propositions; terms are linguistic items that can be used to express
concepts. The precise relation between concepts and language may be
complicated, however. In what follows, small capitals denote concepts
and italics denote terms.) Typically when someone calls an action bad,
they evaluate it negatively without committing themselves to much if
anything by way of non-evaluative description. This descriptive
thinness of bad makes it more general than
selfish or cruel. Even
if calling something selfish evaluates it as bad in some way or
respect, not just any bad act can count as selfish; it must also
involve the agent giving a certain degree of priority to herself over
others. So the application of thick terms and concepts seems somehow
to involve both evaluation and non-evaluative description.

It is primarily this combination of evaluation and non-evaluative
description that has attracted philosophical attention to thick
concepts in ethics since the mid-twentieth century. Thick concepts
have been thought to provide leverage in various debates concerning
the nature of evaluative thought and talk and to illuminate such
questions as whether there is a robust fact-value distinction, whether
ethical claims enjoy a significant kind of objectivity, and how
evaluative classifications relate to non-evaluative classifications.
Doing justice to the full diversity and complexity of moral thinking
has also been thought to require more attention to thick concepts. The
focus on thin concepts over the thick in much of the history of
Western moral philosophy threatens to simplify and mislead also in
normative ethics, where the revival of virtue ethics as a major
alternative to deontology and consequentialism coincides with
increased attention to thick terms and concepts in metaethics.
Interest in thick concepts has also extended from ethics to other
areas of philosophy such as epistemology and aesthetics. Several
questions run through all these motivations for focusing on thick
concepts. We have a “combination question”: how exactly do
thick terms and concepts combine evaluation and non-evaluative
description? We have a “location question”: is evaluation
somehow inherent to thick terms and concepts, such as perhaps an
aspect of their meaning, or merely a feature of their use? We have a
“delineation question”: how do thick terms differ from the
thin and from other kinds of evaluative terms (such as pejorative
expressions)? Given answers to these questions, what broader
significance within ethics and applications outside of ethics might thick
ethical concepts have? What follows is a survey of various attempts
to answer these questions.

Virtue Ethics,0.5153326392173767,0.5756924152374268,"


Virtue ethics is currently one of three major approaches in
normative ethics. It may, initially, be identified as the one that
emphasizes the virtues, or moral character, in contrast to the approach
that emphasizes duties or rules (deontology) or that emphasizes
the consequences of actions (consequentialism). Suppose it is obvious
that  someone in need should be helped. A utilitarian will point
to the fact that the consequences of doing so will maximize well-being,
a deontologist to the fact that, in doing so the agent will be acting
in accordance with a moral rule such as “Do unto others as you
would be done by” and a virtue ethicist to the fact that helping
the person would be charitable or benevolent.

This is not to say that only virtue ethicists attend to virtues, any more than it is to say that only consequentialists attend to consequences or only deontologists to rules. Each of the above-mentioned approaches can make room for virtues, consequences, and rules. Indeed, any plausible normative ethical theory will have something to say about all three.  What distinguishes virtue ethics from consequentialism or deontology is the centrality of virtue within the theory (Watson 1990; Kawall 2009). Whereas consequentialists will define virtues as traits that yield good consequences and deontologists will define them as traits possessed by those who reliably fulfil their duties, virtue ethicists will resist the attempt to define virtues in terms of some other concept that is taken to be more fundamental. Rather, virtues and vices will be foundational for virtue ethical theories and other normative notions will be grounded in them.

We begin by discussing two concepts that are central to all forms of virtue ethics, namely, virtue and practical wisdom. Then we note some of the features that distinguish different virtue ethical theories from one another before turning to objections that have been raised against virtue ethics and responses offered on its behalf. We conclude with a look at some of the directions in which future research might develop.

Phenomenological Approaches to Ethics and Information Technology,0.5625115633010864,0.8856728076934814,"

Information and communication technology (simply referred to as
‘information technology’ here) is changing many aspects of
human endeavour and existence. This is beyond dispute for most. What
are contested are the social and ethical implications of these
changes. Possible sources of these disputes are the multiple ways in
which one can conceptualize and interpret the information
technology/society interrelationship. Each of these ways of
conceptualization and interpretation enables one to see the
information technology/society relationship differently and therefore
construe its social and ethical implications in a different manner. At
the center of this technology/society interrelationship we find many
complex questions about the nature of the human, the technical,
agency, autonomy, freedom and much more. This is indeed a vast
intellectual landscape, which can obviously not be explored here in
its fullness. This entry is about just one particular perspective on
this landscape. It is primarily concerned with the phenomenological
approach to interpreting information technology and its social and
ethical implications. It should be noted from the start that there is
not a unified phenomenological tradition or approach to information
technology in particular, or other phenomena more generally. The
phenomenological tradition consists of many different approaches that
share certain characteristics (certain family resemblances, one might
say) but not all. We may however suggest, with Don Ihde (2003,133),
that they all accept that “phenomenology investigates the
conditions of what makes things appear as such [as that which we take
them to be].” Differently stated, phenomenology suggests that
there is a co-constitutive relationship between us and the phenomena
we encounter in our engagement with the world. In this sense
phenomenologists would suggest that to understand the
technology/society relationship we need to reveal how they
co-constitute each other—i.e. draw on each other for their
ongoing meaning and sense. We will elaborate more precisely what this
means in
 section 2
 below. However, in order to understand the distinctiveness of the
phenomenological approach other possible ways of interpreting this
technology/society relationship will also be outlined briefly
below.

It can be said that information technology has become in a very real
sense ubiquitous. Most everyday technologies such as elevators,
automobiles, microwaves, watches, and so forth depend on
microprocessors for their ongoing operation. Most organizations and
institutions have become reliant on their information technology
infrastructure to a lesser or greater degree. Indeed information
technology is seen by many as a cost-efficient way to solve a
multitude of problems facing our complex contemporary society. One can
almost say that information technology has become construed as the
default technology for solving a whole raft of technical and social
problems such as health provision, security, governance, etc. One
could also argue that it has become synonymous with society’s
view of modernization and progress. For most it seems obvious that
information technology has made it possible for humans to continue to
construct increasingly complex systems of coordination and social
ordering—systems without which contemporary society would not be
able to exist in its present form. To say the least, we, as
contemporary human beings, have our manner of being made possible
through a rather comprehensive entanglement with information and
communication technology. Indeed, the economic, organizational and
social benefit of information technology is not widely disputed. The
dispute is more often about the way information technology is changing
or transforming the social domain, and in particular, the ethical
domain. This dispute is largely centered around different ways of
conceptualizing and interpreting the nature of our entanglement with
information technology. This debate is not merely an academic debate
about different and competing theoretical ‘models.’
Rather, these different ways of conceptualizing it is central to our
understanding of how we go about managing our increasingly entangled
relationship with information technology.

Human Enhancement,0.5096386671066284,0.8356664180755615,"
At first glance there does not seem to be anything philosophically
problematic about human enhancement. Activities such as physical
fitness routines, wearing eyeglasses, taking music lessons and prayer
are routinely utilized for the goal of enhancing human capacities. This
entry is not concerned with every activity and intervention that might
improve people’s embodied lives. The focus of this entry is a
cluster of debates in practical ethics that is conventionally labeled
as “the ethics of human enhancement”. These debates include
clinicians’ concerns about the limits of legitimate health care,
parents’ worries about their reproductive and rearing
obligations, and the efforts of competitive institutions like sports to
combat cheating, as well as more general questions about distributive
justice, science policy, and the public regulation of medical
technologies.

As usual in practical ethics, an adequate discussion of any specific
debate under this heading quickly requires orientation to the science
underlying particular enhancement interventions and an appreciation of
the social and political contexts in which it unfolds. At each turn in
these discussions, wide vistas of background philosophical topics also
appear for exploration.  Rather than providing a detailed account of
this whole landscape, this entry hikes a narrow ridge between the
different dimensions of the topic, pointing out the side trails but
not following them into their respective thickets. Instead, it traces
a path of core concerns that winds through all the current debates on
the ethics of human enhancement, as guide for those interested in
exploring further. To look ahead, our claim is that three sets of
philosophical considerations are key to navigating this literature:
first, conceptual concerns about the limits of legitimate health care,
then moral worries about fairness, authenticity and human nature, and
finally political questions about governance and policy.

"Justice, Inequality, and Health",0.4802061021327973,0.8475620150566101,"
 Among American men, there is a 15.4 year difference in life
expectancy between Asians and high-risk urban blacks, where these
groups constitute, respectively, the best-off and worst-off groups of
men in the ‘eight Americas’ analysis of mortality in the
United States by Murray and colleagues (2006).  Among American women,
the corresponding difference in life expectancy is 12.8 years,
although the worst-off group of women is low-income southern rural
blacks (‘America 7’) rather than high-risk urban blacks
(‘America 8’).  On the face of it, these inequalities in
American life expectancy are seriously unjust.


If one turns to the international context, inequalities in life
expectancy of a similar magnitude can be observed even between the
worst-off countries and the global average: In 2011, life expectancy
in 19 countries was 15 years or more below the global life expectancy
of 70 years; and this global average was itself 13 years below life
expectancy in Japan and Switzerland, which had the highest national
averages of all (WHO 2013, Table 1).


But whether the appearances of injustice here will withstand close
scrutiny is a separate question.  Not all inequalities in life
expectancy seem unjust.  For example, in 2010, life expectancy for all
American women was 80.9 years, whereas for all American men it was
only 76.3 years (Wang et al., 2013). Presumably, little (if any) of
this 4.6 year inequality in life expectancy represents an
injustice. However, if some inequalities in health are not unjust,
then inequalities in health are not unjust per se.


So what makes a health inequality an injustice, when it is one? Do
health inequalities have some significance in justice that
differs from other important inequalities? Or is the injustice of an
unjust inequality in health simply due to the application of general
principles of equality and justice to the case of health?


To answer these questions, one has to examine two rather different
literatures. On the one hand, there is an empirical literature
concerning the underlying determinants of health and, on the other
hand, there is a philosophical literature concerned with the ethics of
population health. The former literature is considerably more
extensive and developed than the latter. Even there, however, the

Justice and Access to Health Care,0.4817155599594116,0.8444892764091492,"

Many societies, and nearly all wealthy, developed countries, provide
universal access to a broad range of public health and personal
medical services. Is such access to health care a requirement of
social justice, or is it simply a matter of social policy that some
countries adopt and others do not? If it is a requirement of social
justice, we should be clear about what kinds of care we owe people and
how we determine what care is owed if we cannot possibly meet every
health need, as arguably no society can. We should be clear about what
constitutes appropriate access to that care, given that there are
diverse barriers to access. We must also be able to say why we owe
these things as a matter of justice, and, of course, different
accounts of social justice will bake and serve this cake in different
ways.

In what follows, we shall address these questions in the following
order. In Section 1, we describe briefly what some societies actually
do to assure universal access to health care. Although health care is
more equally distributed in these societies than other social goods,
nevertheless health inequalities persist across demographic groups.
This implies a question we shall have to address: if universal access
cannot assure equality in health status, because there are other
important social determinants of population health and its
distribution, then is universal access a requirement of justice after
all? We shall also examine some of the consequences of unequal access
to care, for these may compound the effects of inequitable
distributions of other determinants of health. In Section 2, we
examine more carefully the concept of access to care. How, for
example, do we actually tell if access to care is equal or equitable?
The problem of measuring access to care aside, we might think that the
concept of equal access is straightforwardly analyzed, and the concept
of equitable access depends in a more complex way on what inequalities
in access are permissible. We shall see, however, that considerations
of justice bear on judgments about equal access as well as on those
about equitable access. In Section 3, we examine three different lines
of argument for universal access. In Section 4, we consider what kinds
of care these views, especially the opportunity-based account, imply
that we owe each other. In Section 5, we consider whether we have a
right to health or health care, in light of those views of justice,
and what entitlements follow from such a right if there is one.

"Pregnancy, Birth, and Medicine",0.5909215807914734,0.7093355655670166,"

When philosophers have turned their attention to the ethics of
reproduction, they have mostly focused on abortion, and to a lesser
extent on various assisted reproductive technologies used to create a
pregnancy. However, a number of thorny ethical issues can arise during
the course of a continuing pregnancy, labor, and birth, and these are
receiving growing attention in bioethics. This article is restricted
to a discussion of such issues. See the entries on
 feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,
 parenthood and procreation, and
 the grounds of moral status
 for discussions of related issues such as abortion and assisted
reproduction.

Pregnancy and birth can be approached from many philosophical angles.
Pregnancy raises interesting issues in philosophy of law, such as the
appropriate legal status of the fetus and whether pregnancy ought to
be legally classified as a disability. Some authors have discussed
pregnancy in phenomenological terms, and others have used pregnancy
and/or birth as a springboard for more theoretical reflections on the
nature of selfhood, care, embodiment, and personal identity. In this
article, however, we will focus on pregnancy and birth insofar as they
are treated as medical processes and situated within a
medical context. (The boundary around this topic is necessarily
imperfect, since medical, legal, metaphysical, experiential, and other
contexts intersect. For instance, one cannot responsibly examine the
ethics of treating the fetus as a medical patient without at
least considering the legal ramifications of doing so.) For better or
for worse, in most developed countries, including the United States
and Canada, normal pregnancy and birth are highly
‘medicalized’. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for women
to experience problems during pregnancy that require medical care and
intervention. The medical management of both ‘normal’
pregnancies and those that face complications raises a variety of
complex ethical issues, and these will be our topic.

We will begin with a general discussion of pregnancy and childbirth as
medicalized processes. We will then move on to three categories of
ethical issues: (1) issues arising in the course of obstetrical care
for women who are taken to be competent and capable of autonomous
decision-making; (2) issues that arise when women are decisionally
incompetent or when their right to decisional autonomy is in question;
(3) issues concerning the management and communication of reproductive
risk.

Privacy and Medicine,0.5283921957015991,0.8792151212692261,"
Individuals, institutions and governments practice, value and
protect medical privacy (Beauchamp and Childress 2008; Humber and
Almeder 2001; Englehardt 2000b). As a general rule, they try to limit
access to health information and biospecimens, respect health-related
decisions, and honor both individual and community expectations of
bodily modesty, intimacy, bodily integrity, and self-ownership (Winslade 2014). 
First, while information-sharing has grown more common,individuals
commonly keep some health concerns to themselves, whether out of
personal taste, ethical reserve, etiquette, fear or shame (Rosenberg
2000; Buss 1980; Westin 1967). When they share sensitive health
concerns with others, most individuals employ culturally appropriate
discretion and reserve (Nissenbaum 2009; Goffman 1959, 1963). Because
of such privacy practices, families, friends, employers, researchers
and governments may not acquire all the medical information they want,
when they want it (Currie 2005; Etzioni 2000). The rise
of social media, smart phones, wearable health monitoring devices and
personal possession of electronic copies of medical records represent
diverse opportunities for intended and unintended disclosures of
health-related images and information.The practical ability of
individuals to control and protect their health privacy is partly a
function of their knowledge of contemporary medical data management
practices and their social-economic position (Marx 2007). Children,
along with adults in active military service, judged mentally
incompetent, dependent on government entitlement programs or
incarcerated, lack substantial control over medical privacy (Annas et
al. 2013). 
Second, many medical professionals, hospitals, insurers and other
entities with access to health information regard maintaining the
confidentiality of medical communications and the security of medical
information as paramount professional responsibilities (IOM 1994,
2000).  This sensibility extends to social work, mental health and
pharmacy records. Moreover, clinical health care providers and medical
researchers generally seek to accommodate patients’ reasonable
expectations of privacy and are required to do so by state and
national laws (Allen 2011).
Third, societies impose major privacy and private choice-related
legal obligations on their members (Westin 1967). Legal obligations of
privacy bind citizens to one another and also bind health care
providers, insurers, health-data processors, health researchers,
public health officials and government (CDT 2008,
in Other Internet Resources; DHHS 2015; GAO
2001). Thus in a number of legal systems, disclosing a private medical
fact or breaching medical confidentiality can result in civil
liability (Solove 2004, 2008). The law imposes obligations to respect
informational privacy (e.g., confidentiality, anonymity, secrecy and
data security); physical privacy (e.g., modesty and bodily integrity);
associational privacy (e.g., intimate sharing of death, illness and
recovery); proprietary privacy (e.g., self-ownership and control over
personal identifiers, genetic data, and biospecimens); and decisional
privacy (e.g., autonomy and choice in medical decision-making) (Allen
2011).

Public Health Ethics,0.4792221188545227,0.8447756767272949,"


At its core, public health is concerned with promoting and protecting
the health of 
populations,[1]
 broadly understood. Collective
interventions in service of population health often involve or require
government action. In the United States, for example, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Protection Agency are
in part or in whole public health agencies. All nations and most
states or provinces and municipalities have health departments whose
functions include everything from the inspection of commercial food
service to the collection and use of epidemiological data for
population surveillance of disease. Collective action to promote and
protect population health also occurs at the global level, as
exemplified by the activities of the World Health Organization. Public
health ethics deals primarily with the moral foundations and
justifications for public health, the various ethical challenges
raised by limited resources for promoting health, and real or
perceived tensions between collective benefits and individual
liberty.


One view of public health ethics regards the moral foundation of
public health as an injunction to maximize welfare, and therefore
health as a component of welfare (Powers & Faden 2006). This view
frames the core moral challenge of public health as balancing
individual liberties with the advancement of good health outcomes.
Consider, for example, how liberties are treated in government
policies that fluoridate municipal drinking water or compel people
with active, infectious tuberculosis to be treated.


An alternative view of public health ethics characterizes the moral
foundation of public health as social justice. While balancing
individuals' liberties with promoting social goods is one area of
concern, it is embedded within a broader commitment to secure a
sufficient level of health for all and to narrow unjust inequalities
(Powers & Faden, 
2006).[2]
,
[3] 
Thus, another important area of concern is
the balancing of this commitment with the injunction to maximize good
aggregate or collective health outcomes. Understood this way, public
health ethics has deep moral connections to broader questions of
social justice, poverty, and systematic disadvantage.


Against the backdrop of these two normative approaches, this paper
proceeds as follows: Section 1 lays out some of the distinctive
challenges of public health ethics. Section 2 discusses different
justifications for public health interventions, including the role of
paternalism and how it bears on the permissibility of public health
interventions. Also discussed in Section 2 are broader questions of
democratic legitimacy. Section 3 focuses on questions of justice and
fairness in public health ethics. Finally, Section 4 discusses global
justice as it intersects with public health. Overall, this entry
strives to provide a general lay of the land of the central issues
that drive public health ethics, with a particular focus on questions
of justice and 
fairness.[4]

Ethics of Stem Cell Research,0.5284847021102905,0.9422189593315125,"


Human embryonic stem cell (HESC) research offers much hope for
alleviating the human suffering brought on by the ravages of disease
and injury. HESCs are characterized by their capacity for
self-renewal and their ability to differentiate into all types of cells
of the body. The main goal of HESC research is to identify the
mechanisms that govern cell differentiation and to turn HESCs into
specific cell types that can be used for treating debilitating and
life-threatening diseases and injuries.


Despite the tremendous therapeutic promise of HESC research, the
research has met with heated opposition because the harvesting of HESCs
involves the destruction of the human embryo. HESCs are derived in
vitro around the fifth day of the embryo's development
(Thomson et al. 1998). A typical day-5 human embryo
consists of 200–250 cells, most of which comprise the trophoblast,
which is the outermost layer of the blastocyst. HESCs are harvested
from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, which consists of 30–34
cells. The derivation of HESC cultures requires the removal of
the trophoblast. This process of disaggregating the
blastocyst's cells eliminates its potential for further
development. Opponents of HESC research argue that the research
is morally impermissible because it involves the unjust killing of
innocent human beings.


Scientists recently succeeded in converting adult human skin cells
into cells that appear to have the properties of HESCs by activating
four genes in the adult cells (Takahashi et al. 2007; Yu
et al. 2007). The reprogrammed cells—“induced
pluripotent stem cells” (iPSCs)—could ultimately
eliminate the need for HESCs. However, at present, the consensus in
the scientific community is that both HESC and iPSC research should be
pursued, as we do not yet know whether iPSCs have the same potential
as HESCs or whether it is safe to transplant them into humans. Thus,
the controversies around HESC research will continue, at least in the
near-term.


While the principal source of the controversy surrounding HESC
research lies in competing views about the value of human embryonic
life, the scope of ethical issues in HESC research is broader than the
question of the ethics of destroying human embryos. It also
encompasses questions about, among other things, whether researchers
who use but do not derive HESCs are complicit in the destruction of
embryos, whether there is a moral distinction between creating embryos
for research purposes and creating them for reproductive ends, the
permissibility of cloning human embryos to harvest HESCs, and the
ethics of creating human/non-human chimeras. This entry provides an
overview of all but the last two issues just listed; cloning and
human-non-human chimeras are addressed in separate entries.

Theory and Bioethics,0.5744682550430298,0.7064096331596375,"


As a species of practical ethics, bioethics exhibits a complex and
contested relationship to philosophical theory. On the one hand, many
who teach and write in this interdisciplinary field are philosophers
who naturally believe that their specific contribution to the
field—their “expertise,” if you will—consists
in the application of distinctly philosophical methods, including
various kinds of ethical theory, to practical problems arising in
biomedical research, clinical medicine, and public health. But on the
other hand, many who work in the area of bioethics, including many
philosophers, are highly skeptical of the so-called “applied
ethics” model of moral reasoning, in which exemplars of high
theory (e.g., consequentialist utilitarianism, Kantian deontology,
rights-based theories, natural law, etc.) are directly
“applied” to practical problems. Indeed, most
philosophically-inclined contributors to the bioethics literature have
eschewed high moral theory in favor of various modes of moral
reasoning falling on a spectrum between the strong particularism of
various strains of casuistry or narrative ethics, on one end, and the
mid-level norms of the enormously influential
“principlism” of Beauchamp and Childress, on the other
(Beauchamp and Childress, 2009).[1]
 According to philosophers Robert
K. Fullinwider (2008) and Will Kymlicka (1996), bioethics in the
public domain can and should go about its business as a species of
ethical reflection independently of any reliance upon high-flying
ethical theory.


This article explores the controversy concerning the role of
philosophical theory for practical ethics in general and bioethics in
particular. The main body of this entry dialectically canvasses the
respective claims for “high theory,” for particularistic
“anti-theory,” and for various species of
“mid-level” theorizing in between these extremes. A
discursive taxonomy of the kinds of philosophical theories deployed in
practical ethics—i.e., metaethical, normative,
metaphysical—is provided in a

Eugenics,0.5091835260391235,0.8264873027801514,"


“Eugenics” is a term loaded with historical significance
and a strong negative valence. Its literal meaning—good
birth—suggests a suitable goal for all prospective parents, yet
its historical connotations tie it to the selective breeding programs,
horrifying concentration camps, medical experiments, and mass
exterminations promoted by Germany's Nazi regime in World War II.
Undoubtedly, we have an obligation never to forget the Holocaust, or
to allow history to repeat itself. Yet intuitively we have some moral
obligation to promote good births—to have, in the most literal
sense, eugenic aims. Indeed, if parents are encouraged to provide the
best environment for their children (good nutrition, education, health
care, a loving family situation, etc.), why not also encourage them to
ensure their children have good genes? If we have some moral
obligation to secure the well-being of our future children (a question
explored extensively in the literature on the non-identity problem;
see the entry on the
 nonidentity problem),
 different questions come into focus: how far do such
obligations extend, what justifies them, and can related contemporary
practices be distinguished, in their aims, forms, justifications, and
likely consequences, from the clearly morally impermissible eugenic
programs of the past?


Philosophers have recently begun to explore the possibility of
“liberal” as opposed to “authoritative”
eugenics (Agar 2004). Liberal eugenics would be based upon individual
free choice, pluralist values, and up-to-date scientific understanding
of genetics and epigenetics. Furthermore, advocates of liberal
eugenics aim to be sensitive to the effects of problematic but deeply
entrenched social problems (e.g., racism, sexism, heterosexism) on
individual choice. Authoritative eugenics programs, in contrast, were
coercive state programs designed to promote social goods, and were
based on problematic assumptions about hereditability. Liberal
eugenicists point to significant developments in our understanding of
genetics to help distinguish contemporary liberal eugenics from its
problematic predecessors. Indeed, scientific advances of the last
several decades—years that include the advent of in vitro
fertilization, the funding and completion of the Human Genome Project,
creation of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), and
expansions of pre-implantation screening and prenatal testing
panels—provide not only more precise understandings of genes and
their role in shaping phenotypes and gene-environment interactions,
but also a multitude of possibilities for intervention in the process
of reproduction. How ought we to use this new knowledge and capacity?
This entry offers a short history of the eugenics movement, a survey
of arguments that attempt to define and defend liberal eugenics, and
coverage of a variety of critiques of those arguments.

Smiles, walks, dances, weddings, explosions, hiccups, hand-waves,
arrivals and departures, births and deaths, thunder and lightning: the
variety of the world seems to lie not only in the assortment of its
ordinary citizens—animals and physical objects, and perhaps
minds, sets, abstract particulars—but also in the sort of things
that happen to or are performed by them. In the last few decades, this
view has been a focus of considerable debate in philosophy, with
implications reaching far into the concern of other disciplines as
well, above all linguistics and the cognitive sciences. Indeed, there
is little question that human perception, action, language, and
thought manifest at least a prima facie commitment to
entities of this sort:

Pre-linguistic infants appear to be able to discriminate and
“count” events, and the content of adult perception,
especially in the auditory realm, endorses the discrimination and
recognition as events of some aspects of the perceived
scene.
Humans (and, arguably, other animals) appear to form the intention
to plan and execute actions, and to bring about changes in the
world.
Dedicated linguistic devices (such as verb tenses and aspects,
nominalization of some verbs, certain proper names) are tuned to events
and event structures, as opposed to entities and structures of other
sorts.
Thinking about the temporal and causal aspects of the
world seems to require parsing those aspects in terms of events and
their descriptions.



It is, however, unclear to what extent such prima facie
commitments add up to an integrated phenomenon, as opposed to
separate, independent dispositions. Moreover, even among those who
favor a realist attitude towards the ontological status of events
there is significant disagreement concerning the precise nature of
such entities. (Their broad characterization as ‘things that
happen’, though commonly found in dictionaries, merely shifts
the burden to the task of clarifying the meaning of
‘happen’.) One useful approach is to set them against
entities belonging to other, philosophically more familiar,
metaphysical categories. In the following we review the main contrasts
between events and those categories that have in the literature been
put forward explicitly as their ontological competitors, or at least
as categories exhibiting significant differences with the category of
events. Along the way, we shall also review the main conceptual tools
that metaphysicians and other philosophers have adopted in their
attempts to deal with events, either from a realist or from a
non-realist perspective.

Evidence,0.7359796762466431,0.7965425252914429,"

For my own part, I think that if one were looking for a single
phrase to capture the stage to which philosophy has progressed,
‘the study of evidence’ would be a better choice than
‘the study of language’.
   —A.J. Ayer, Philosophy in the Twentieth
Century


And when we try to define ‘evidence’ … we find it
very difficult.
   —R.G. Collingwood, The Idea of
History

The concept of evidence is central to both epistemology and the
philosophy of science. Of course, ‘evidence’ is hardly a
philosopher's term of art: it is not only, or even primarily,
philosophers who routinely speak of evidence, but also lawyers and
judges, historians and scientists, investigative journalists and
reporters, as well as the members of numerous other professions and
ordinary folk in the course of everyday life. The concept of evidence
would thus seem to be on firmer pre-theoretical ground than various
other concepts which enjoy similarly central standing within
philosophy. (Contrast, for example, the epistemologist's
quasi-technical term ‘epistemic justification’.)
When one compares philosophical accounts of evidence with the way
the concept is often employed in non-philosophical contexts, however,
a tension soon emerges. Consider first the kinds of things which
non-philosophers are apt to count as evidence. For the forensics
expert, evidence might consist of fingerprints on a gun, a bloodied
knife, or a semen-stained dress: evidence is, paradigmatically, the
kind of thing which one might place in a plastic bag and label
‘Exhibit A’. Thus, a criminal defense attorney might float
the hypothesis that the evidence which seems to incriminate his client
was planted by a corrupt law enforcement official or hope for it to be
misplaced by a careless clerk. For an archaeologist, evidence is the
sort of thing which one might dig up from the ground and carefully
send back to one's laboratory for further analysis. Similarly, for the
historian, evidence might consist of hitherto overlooked documents
recently discovered in an archive or in an individual's personal
 library.[1]
 Reflection on examples such as these naturally suggests that evidence
consists paradigmatically of physical objects, or perhaps, physical
objects arranged in certain ways. For presumably, physical objects are
the sort of thing which one might place in a plastic bag, dig up from
the ground, send to a laboratory, or discover among the belongings of
an individual of historical interest. 

 However natural such a picture might be, it is at least somewhat
difficult to reconcile with historically prominent philosophical
accounts of the nature of evidence. Russell, the greatest empiricist
of the first half of the twentieth century, tended to think of
evidence as sense data, mental items of one's present
consciousness with which one is immediately acquainted. In this, he
stood squarely within the tradition of classical empiricism. Quine,
the greatest empiricist of the second half of the century, maintained
throughout his career that evidence consisted of the stimulation of
one's sensory
 receptors.[2]
 The logical positivists held that whatever evidence there is for a
given scientific theory is afforded by observation statements
or ‘protocol sentence’, linguistic entities with
suitably-restricted contents; the precise nature of the restrictions
became a vigorously contested matter within the tradition
 itself.[3]
 According to one recent and influential study, one's evidence consists
of the totality of propositions that one knows (Williamson 2000).
According to another, one's evidence consists exclusively of one's current mental states (Conee and Feldman 2004). Within
contemporary confirmation theory, a prominent version of Bayesianism is
naturally understood as identifying one's evidence with those beliefs
of which one is psychologically certain. Of course, the suggestion that
one might place sense data, sensory receptor stimulations, known
propositions, or one's current mental states in a plastic bag (or dig them
up from the ground, or send them to a laboratory, or …) is of dubious
intelligibility. From the perspective of much ordinary thought and talk
about evidence, much philosophical theorizing about evidence would seem
to embody a particularly grotesque category mistake. 

 Moreover, it is not simply that the accounts of evidence that have
been advanced by philosophers stand in at least some prima
facie tension with much that is said and thought about evidence
outside of philosophy. As even the cursory survey offered above makes
clear, philosophers themselves have offered quite divergent theories
of what sorts of things are eligible to serve as evidence. What might
account for such discrepancies?

 One possibility is the following.  Both in and outside of philosophy,
the concept of evidence has often been called upon to fill a number of
distinct roles. Although some of these roles are complementary, others
stand in at least some measure of tension with one another. Indeed, as
we will see below, it is far from obvious that any one thing could
play all of the diverse roles that evidence has at various times been
expected to play. Different theories about the nature of evidence
might thus naturally emerge from different emphases on the competing
demands that have been placed on the concept.  In what follows, I
survey some of the theoretical roles that the concept of evidence has
been asked to play and explore some of the relations among them.

The Legal Concept of Evidence,0.7381417751312256,0.8032206296920776,"
The legal concept of evidence is neither static nor universal.
Medieval understandings of evidence in the age of trial by ordeal
would be quite alien to modern sensibilities (Ho 2003–2004) and
there is no approach to evidence and proof that is shared by all
legal systems of the world today. Even within Western legal
traditions, there are significant differences between Anglo-American
law and Continental European law (see Damaška 1973, 1975,
1992, 1994, 1997). This entry focuses on the modern concept of
evidence that operates in the legal tradition to which Anglo-American
law belongs.[1]
It may seem obvious that there must be a legal concept of
evidence that is distinguishable from the ordinary concept of
evidence.  After all, there are in law many special rules on what can
or cannot be introduced as evidence in court, on how evidence is to be
presented and the uses to which it may be put, on the strength or
sufficiency of evidence needed to establish proof and so forth. But
the law remains silent on some crucial matters. In resolving the
factual disputes before the court, the jury or, at a bench trial, the
judge has to rely on extra-legal principles. There have been academic
attempts at systematic analysis of the operation of these principles
in legal fact-finding (Wigmore 1937; Anderson, Schum and Twining
2009). These principles, so it is claimed, are of a general nature. On
the basis that the logic in “drawing inferences from evidence to
test hypotheses and justify conclusions” is governed by the same
principles across different disciplines (Twining and Hampsher-Monk
2003: 4), ambitious projects have been undertaken to develop a
cross-disciplinary framework for the analysis of evidence (Schum 1994)
and to construct an interdisciplinary “integrated science of
evidence” (Dawid, Twining and Vasilaki 2011; cf. Tillers
2008).
While evidential reasoning in law and in other contexts may share
certain characteristics, there nevertheless remain aspects of the
approach to evidence and proof that are distinctive to law (Rescher
and Joynt 1959). Section 1 (“conceptions of evidence”)
identifies different meanings of evidence in legal discourse. When
lawyers talk about evidence, what is it that they are referring to?
What is it that they have in mind? Section 2 (“conditions for
receiving evidence”) approaches the concept of legal evidence
from the angle of what counts as evidence in law. What are the
conditions that the law imposes and must be met for something to be
received by the court as evidence? Section 3 (“strength of
evidence”) shifts the attention to the stage where the evidence
has already been received by the court. Here the focus is on how the
court weighs the evidence in reaching the verdict. In this connection,
three properties of evidence will be discussed: probative value,
sufficiency and degree of completeness.

Since World War II, moral, political, and legal philosophers have
become increasingly interested in the concept of evil. This interest
has been partly motivated by ascriptions of ‘evil’ by
laymen, social scientists, journalists, and politicians as they try to
understand and respond to various atrocities and horrors, such as
genocides, terrorist attacks, mass murders, and tortures and killing
sprees by psychopathic serial killers. It seems that we cannot capture
the moral significance of these actions and their perpetrators by
calling them ‘wrong’ or ‘bad’ or even
‘very very wrong’ or ‘very very bad.’ We need
the concept of evil.

To avoid confusion, it is important to note that there are at least
two concepts of evil: a broad concept and a narrow concept. The broad
concept picks out any bad state of affairs, wrongful action, or
character flaw. The suffering of a toothache is evil in the broad
sense as is a white lie. Evil in the broad sense has been divided into
two categories: natural evil and moral evil. Natural evils are bad
states of affairs which do not result from the intentions or
negligence of moral agents. Hurricanes and toothaches are examples of
natural evils. By contrast, moral evils do result from the intentions
or negligence of moral agents. Murder and lying are examples of moral
evils.

Evil in the broad sense, which includes all natural and moral evils,
tends to be the sort of evil referenced in theological contexts, such
as in discussions of the problem of evil. The problem of evil is the
problem of accounting for evil in a world created by an all-powerful,
all-knowing, all-good God. It seems that if the creator has these
attributes, there would be no evil in the world. But there is evil in
the world. Thus, there is reason to believe that an all-powerful,
all-knowing, all-good creator does not exist.

In contrast to the broad concept of evil, the narrow concept of evil
picks out only the most morally despicable sorts of actions,
characters, events, etc. As Marcus Singer puts it
“‘evil’ [in this sense] … is the worst
possible term of opprobrium imaginable” (Singer 2004, 185).
Since the narrow concept of evil involves moral condemnation, it is
appropriately ascribed only to moral agents and their actions. For
example, if only human beings are moral agents, then only human beings
can perform evil actions. Evil in this narrower sense is more often
meant when the term ‘evil’ is used in contemporary moral,
political, and legal contexts. This entry will focus on evil in this
narrower sense. The entry will not discuss evil in the broad sense or
the problem of evil to any significant degree (these topics will be
discussed briefly only in section 2).

The main issues discussed by philosophers on the topic of evil have
been: Should we use the term ‘evil’ in our moral,
political, and legal discourse and thinking, or is evil an out-dated
or empty concept which should be abandoned? What is the relationship
between evil and other moral concepts such as badness and wrongdoing?
What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for evil action? What
are the necessary and sufficient conditions for evil character? What
is the relationship between evil action and evil character? What types
of evil actions and characters can exist? What is the proper analysis
of derivative concepts such as evil institution?

This entry gives an overview of answers to these questions found in
the literature.

The Problem of Evil,0.6868667006492615,0.6041260361671448,"


The epistemic question posed by evil is whether the world contains
undesirable states of affairs that provide the basis for an argument
that makes it unreasonable to believe in the existence of
God.


This discussion is divided into eight sections. The first is
concerned with some preliminary distinctions; the second, with the
choice between deductive versions of the argument from evil, and
evidential versions; the third, with alternative evidential
formulations of the argument from evil; the fourth, with the
distinction between three very different types of responses to the
argument from evil: attempted total refutations, defenses, and
theodicies. The fifth section then focuses upon attempted total
refutations, while the sixth is concerned with defenses, and the
seventh with some traditional theodicies. The possibility of more
modest variants on defenses and theodicies, based on the idea of
global properties, is then considered in section eight.

Evolution in its contemporary meaning in biology typically refers to
the changes in the proportions of biological types in a population
over time (see the entry on
 the concept of evolution to 1872

[Editor's Note: The following revised entry has a new title. It was previously titled 
  Evolution.]




“Evolution” in contemporary discussions denotes the theory
of the change of organic species over time. Prior to the second half
of the nineteenth century, the term was used primarily, if not
exclusively, in an embryological sense to designate the development of
the individual embryo. These same ambiguities of usage also surround
the German term “Entwicklungsgeschichte” which originally
was used in an embryological context. In 1852 the English philosopher
Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) used the term to denote both cosmic
and biological changes from “homogeneity” to
“heterogeneity.” In the 1860s the term was used in some
contexts to designate species change (Bowler 1975). Darwin himself did
not use this term for his theory until the Descent of Man
(1871). Since this article will survey the broad history of these
theories through the publication of the Descent of Man, the
term “transformism,” a term that came into common use in
French biological sources around 1835, will generally be used in this
article to designate the theory of species change prior to the shift
in meaning in the 1860s. Since Darwin's work, the designator
“evolution” has been typically, if not exclusively, linked
with the theory of natural selection as the primary cause by which
such species change has occurred over historical time.  


This entry intends to give a broad historical review of the topic
through the initial Darwinian phase of the“Darwinian
Revolution”. Other entries in this encyclopedia referred to in
the bibliography and within this article should be consulted for
discussions beyond this point. The issues will be examined under the

Morality and Evolutionary Biology,0.5432347655296326,0.6762624382972717,"


A recent article in The Economist—sporting the
provocative subtitle “Biology Invades a Field Philosophers
Thought was Safely Theirs”—begins with the following
rumination:


Whence morality? That is a question which has troubled philosophers
since their subject was invented. Two and a half millennia of debate
have, however, failed to produce a satisfactory answer. So now it is
time for someone else to have a go…Perhaps [biologists] can
eventually do what philosophers have never managed, and explain moral
behavior in an intellectually satisfying
 way.[1]



This passage epitomizes a growing theme in the popular and
scientific media, echoing claims made forty years ago with the
emergence of sociobiology, when E.O. Wilson suggested that
“the time has come for ethics to be removed temporarily from the
hands of the philosophers and biologicized” (Wilson 1975, 562).
For their part, moral philosophers will hasten to point out that they
are not primarily in the business of “explaining moral
behavior” in the sense of causally explaining the origins of our
capacity for moral judgment or of various associated emotional and
behavioral dispositions. If a moral philosopher asks “whence
morality,” she is more likely to be concerned with the
justification of moral principles or the source and nature of
obligation. Still, there are important potential connections between
the scientific explanatory issues and philosophical ones, opening the
way for profitable interdisciplinary inquiry.


Section 1 provides an overview of the issues and a sketch of the
connections between them, highlighting important distinctions we will
need throughout. Sections 2, 3 and 4 then go on to explore critically
the three main branches of inquiry at the intersection of morality and
evolutionary biology: Descriptive Evolutionary Ethics, Prescriptive
Evolutionary Ethics, and Evolutionary Metaethics.

Evolutionary Game Theory,0.7764829993247986,0.9081932902336121,"


Evolutionary game theory originated as an application of the
mathematical theory of games to biological contexts, arising from the
realization that frequency dependent fitness introduces a strategic
aspect to evolution. Recently, however, evolutionary game theory has
become of increased interest to economists, sociologists, and
anthropologists--and social scientists in general--as well as
philosophers. The interest among social scientists in a theory with
explicit biological roots derives from three facts. First, the
‘evolution’ treated by evolutionary game theory need not be
biological evolution. ‘Evolution’ may, in this context,
often be understood as cultural evolution, where this refers
to changes in beliefs and norms over time. Second, the rationality
assumptions underlying evolutionary game theory are, in many cases,
more appropriate for the modelling of social systems than those
assumptions underlying the traditional theory of games. Third,
evolutionary game theory, as an explicitly dynamic theory, provides an
important element missing from the traditional theory. In the preface
to Evolution and the Theory of Games, Maynard Smith notes that
“[p]aradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is more readily
applied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it
was originally designed.” It is perhaps doubly paradoxical, then, that
the subsequent development of evolutionary game theory has
produced a theory which holds great promise for social scientists, and
is as readily applied to the field of economic behaviour as that for
which it was originally designed.

Evolutionary Psychology,0.9767101407051086,0.5776395797729492,"

Evolutionary psychology is one of many biologically informed
approaches to the study of human behavior. Along with cognitive
psychologists, evolutionary psychologists propose that much, if not
all, of our behavior can be explained by appeal to internal
psychological mechanisms. What distinguishes evolutionary
psychologists from many cognitive psychologists is the proposal that
the relevant internal mechanisms are adaptations—products of
natural selection—that helped our ancestors get around the
world, survive and reproduce. To understand the central claims of
evolutionary psychology we require an understanding of some key
concepts in evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, philosophy of
science and philosophy of mind. Philosophers are interested in
evolutionary psychology for a number of reasons. For philosophers of
science —mostly philosophers of biology—evolutionary
psychology provides a critical target. There is a broad consensus
among philosophers of science that evolutionary psychology is a deeply
flawed enterprise. For philosophers of mind and cognitive science
evolutionary psychology has been a source of empirical hypotheses
about cognitive architecture and specific components of that
architecture. Philosophers of mind are also critical of evolutionary
psychology but their criticisms are not as all-encompassing as those
presented by philosophers of biology. Evolutionary psychology is also
invoked by philosophers interested in moral psychology both as a
source of empirical hypotheses and as a critical target.

In what follows I briefly explain evolutionary psychology’s
relations to other work on the biology of human behavior and the
cognitive sciences. Next I introduce the research tradition’s
key theoretical concepts. In the following section I take up
discussions about evolutionary psychology in the philosophy of mind,
specifically focusing on the debate about the massive modularity
thesis. I go on to review some of the criticisms of evolutionary
psychology presented by philosophers of biology and assess some
responses to those criticisms. I then go on to introduce some of
evolutionary psychology’s contributions to moral psychology and
human nature and, finally, briefly discuss the reach and impact of
evolutionary psychology.

Existentialism,0.5444460511207581,0.5165826678276062,"


Like “rationalism” and “empiricism,”
“existentialism” is a term that belongs to intellectual
history. Its definition is thus to some extent one of historical
convenience. The term was explicitly adopted as a self-description by
Jean-Paul Sartre, and through the wide dissemination of the postwar
literary and philosophical output of Sartre and his
associates—notably Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty,
and Albert Camus—existentialism became identified with a
cultural movement that flourished in Europe in the 1940s and
1950s. Among the major philosophers identified as existentialists
(many of whom—for instance Camus and Heidegger—repudiated
the label) were Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger, and Martin Buber in
Germany, Jean Wahl and Gabriel Marcel in France, the Spaniards
José Ortega y Gasset and Miguel de Unamuno, and the Russians
Nikolai Berdyaev and Lev Shestov. The nineteenth century philosophers,
Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, came to be seen as
precursors of the movement. Existentialism was as much a literary
phenomenon as a philosophical one. Sartre's own ideas were and are
better known through his fictional works (such as Nausea
and No Exit) than through his more purely philosophical ones
(such as Being and Nothingness and Critique of
Dialectical Reason), and the postwar years found a very diverse
coterie of writers and artists linked under the term: retrospectively,
Dostoevsky, Ibsen, and Kafka were conscripted; in Paris there were
Jean Genet, André Gide, André Malraux, and the
expatriate Samuel Beckett; the Norwegian Knut Hamsun and the Romanian
Eugene Ionesco belong to the club; artists such as Alberto Giacometti
and even Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Arshile
Gorky, and Willem de Kooning, and filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard
and Ingmar Bergman were understood in existential terms. By the mid
1970s the cultural image of existentialism had become a cliché,
parodized in countless books and films by Woody Allen.


It is sometimes suggested, therefore, that existentialism just is this
bygone cultural movement rather than an identifiable philosophical
position; or, alternatively, that the term should be restricted to
Sartre's philosophy alone. But while a philosophical definition of
existentialism may not entirely ignore the cultural fate of the term,
and while Sartre's thought must loom large in any account of
existentialism, the concept does pick out a distinctive cluster of
philosophical problems and helpfully identifies a relatively distinct
current of twentieth- and now twenty-first-century philosophical
inquiry, one that has had significant impact on fields such as
theology (through Rudolf Bultmann, Paul Tillich, Karl Barth, and
others) and psychology (from Ludwig Binswanger and Medard Boss to Otto
Rank, R. D.  Laing, and Viktor Frankl). What makes this current of
inquiry distinct is not its concern with “existence” in
general, but rather its claim that thinking about human
existence requires new categories not found in the conceptual
repertoire of ancient or modern thought; human beings can be
understood neither as substances with fixed properties, nor as
subjects interacting with a world of objects.


On the existential view, to understand what a human being is it is not
enough to know all the truths that natural science—including the
science of psychology—could tell us. The dualist who holds that
human beings are composed of independent
substances—“mind” and “body”—is no
better off in this regard than is the physicalist, who holds that
human existence can be adequately explained in terms of the
fundamental physical constituents of the universe. Existentialism does
not deny the validity of the basic categories of physics, biology,
psychology, and the other sciences (categories such as matter,
causality, force, function, organism, development, motivation, and so
on). It claims only that human beings cannot be fully understood in
terms of them. Nor can such an understanding be gained by
supplementing our scientific picture with a moral
one. Categories of moral theory such as intention, blame,
responsibility, character, duty, virtue, and the like do
capture important aspects of the human condition, but neither moral
thinking (governed by the norms of the good and the right) nor
scientific thinking (governed by the norm of truth)
suffices. 


“Existentialism”, therefore, may be defined as the
philosophical theory which holds that a further set of categories,
governed by the norm of authenticity, is necessary to grasp
human existence. To approach existentialism in this categorial way may
seem to conceal what is often taken to be its “heart”
(Kaufmann 1968: 12), namely, its character as a gesture of protest
against academic philosophy, its anti-system sensibility, its flight
from the “iron cage” of reason. But while it is true that
the major existential philosophers wrote with a passion and urgency
rather uncommon in our own time, and while the idea that philosophy
cannot be practiced in the disinterested manner of an objective
science is indeed central to existentialism, it is equally true that
all the themes popularly associated with existentialism—dread,
boredom, alienation, the absurd, freedom, commitment, nothingness, and
so on—find their philosophical significance in the context of
the search for a new categorial framework, together with its governing
norm.

Experimental Moral Philosophy,0.5476886630058289,0.6816601753234863,"


Experimental moral philosophy emerged as a methodology in the last
decade of the twentieth century, as a branch of the larger experimental
philosophy (X-Phi) approach.  Experimental moral philosophy is the empirical study of moral intuitions, judgments, and behaviors.  Like other forms of experimental philosophy, it involves gathering data using experimental methods and using these data to substantiate, undermine, or revise philosophical theories.  In this case, the theories in question concern the nature of moral reasoning and judgment; the extent and sources of moral obligations; the nature of a good person and a good life; even the scope and nature of moral theory itself.  This entry begins with a brief look at the historical uses of empirical data in moral theory and goes on to ask what, if anything, is distinctive about experimental moral philosophy—how should we distinguish it from related work in empirical moral psychology?  After discussing some strategies for answering this question, the entry examines two of the main projects within experimental moral philosophy, and then discusses some of the most prominent areas of reseatch within the field.  As we will see, in some cases experimental moral philosophy has opened up new avenues of investigation, while in other cases it has influenced longstanding debates within moral theory.

Experimental Philosophy,0.683459460735321,0.7203876376152039,"

Experimental philosophy is an interdisciplinary approach that brings
together ideas from what had previously been regarded as distinct
fields. Specifically, research in experimental philosophy brings
together two key elements:

the kinds of questions and theoretical frameworks traditionally
associated with philosophy;
the kinds of experimental methods traditionally associated with
psychology and cognitive science.


Though experimental philosophy is united by this broad approach, there
is a diverse range of projects in experimental philosophy. Some use
experimental evidence to support a “negative program”
that challenges more traditional methods in analytic philosophy,
others use experimental data to support positive claims about
traditional questions, and still others explore questions about how
people ordinarily think and feel insofar as these questions are
important in themselves.

This entry provides a brief introduction to the core aims of
contemporary experimental philosophy. It then reviews recent
experimental work on the negative program, free will, moral judgment
and epistemology. We conclude with a discussion of major objections to
the field of experimental philosophy as a whole.

Experiment in Physics,0.9272165298461914,0.5330626368522644,"


Physics, and natural science in general, is a reasonable enterprise
based on valid experimental evidence, criticism, and rational
discussion. It provides us with knowledge of the physical world, and it
is experiment that provides the evidence that grounds this knowledge.
Experiment plays many roles in science. One of its important roles is
to test theories and to provide the basis for scientific
 knowledge.[1]
 It can also call for a new theory, either by
showing that an accepted theory is incorrect, or by exhibiting a new
phenomenon that is in need of explanation. Experiment can provide hints
toward the structure or mathematical form of a theory and it can
provide evidence for the existence of the entities involved in our
theories. Finally, it may also have a life of its own, independent of
theory. Scientists may investigate a phenomenon just because it looks
interesting. Such experiments may provide evidence for a future theory
to explain. [Examples of these different roles will be presented
below.] As we shall see below, a single experiment may play several of
these roles at once.


If experiment is to play these important roles in science then we
must have good reasons to believe experimental results, for science is
a fallible enterprise. Theoretical calculations, experimental results,
or the comparison between experiment and theory may all be wrong.
Science is more complex than “The scientist proposes, Nature disposes.”
It may not always be clear what the scientist is proposing. Theories
often need to be articulated and clarified. It also may not be clear
how Nature is disposing. Experiments may not always give clear-cut
results, and may even disagree for a time.


In what follows, the reader will find an epistemology of experiment,
a set of strategies that provides reasonable belief in experimental
results. Scientific knowledge can then be reasonably based on these
experimental results.

Issues concerning scientific explanation have been a focus of
philosophical attention from Pre-Socratic times through the modern
period. However, recent discussion really begins with the development
of the Deductive-Nomological (DN) model. This model has had
many advocates (including Popper 1935, 1959, Braithwaite 1953,
Gardiner, 1959, Nagel 1961) but unquestionably the most detailed and
influential statement is due to Carl Hempel (Hempel 1942, 1965, and
Hempel & Oppenheim 1948). These papers and the reaction to them
have structured subsequent discussion concerning scientific
explanation to an extraordinary degree. After some general remarks by
way of background and orientation (Section 1), this entry describes
the DN model and its extensions, and then turns to some
well-known objections (Section 2). It next describes a variety of
subsequent attempts to develop alternative models of explanation,
including Wesley Salmon's Statistical Relevance (Section 3)
and Causal Mechanical (Section 4) models and the
Unificationist models due to Michael Friedman and Philip
Kitcher (Section 5). Section 6 provides a summary and discusses
directions for future work.

Exploitation,0.44630587100982666,0.8788821697235107,"

To exploit someone is to take unfair advantage of them. It is to use
another person’s vulnerability for one’s own benefit. Of
course, benefitting from another’s vulnerability is not always
morally wrong—we do not condemn a chess player for exploiting a
weakness in his opponent’s defense, for instance. But some forms
of advantage-taking do seem to be clearly wrong, and it is this
normative sense of exploitation that is of primary interest
to moral and political philosophers.

Exploitation can be transactional or structural. In
the former case, the unfairness is a property of a discrete
transaction between two or more individuals. A sweatshop that pays low
wages, for example, or a pharmaceutical research firm that tests drugs
on poor subjects in the developing world, might be said to exploit
others in this sense. But exploitation can also be
structural—a property of institutions or systems in
which the “rules of the game” unfairly benefit one group
of people to the detriment of another. As we will see below, Karl Marx
believed that the economic and political institutions of capitalism
were exploitative in this sense. And some contemporary feminists have
argued that the institution of traditional marriage is exploitative
insofar as it preys upon and reinforces pernicious forms of inequality
between men and women (Sample 2003: Ch. 4).

Exploitation can also be harmful or mutually
beneficial. Harmful exploitation involves an interaction that
leaves the victim worse off than she was, and than she was entitled to
be. The sort of exploitation involved in coercive sex trafficking, for
instance, is harmful in this sense. But as we will see below, not all
exploitation is harmful. Exploitation can also be mutually beneficial,
where both parties walk away better off than they were ex
ante. What makes such mutually beneficial interactions nevertheless
exploitative is that they are, in some way, unfair.

It is relatively easy to come up with intuitively compelling cases of
unfair, exploitative behavior. Providing a philosophical analysis to
support and develop those intuitions, however, has proven more
difficult. The most obvious difficulty is specifying the conditions
under which a transaction or institution may be said to be unfair.
Does the unfairness involved in exploitation necessarily involve some
kind of harm to its victim? Or a violation of her moral rights? Is the
unfairness involved in exploitation a matter of procedure, substance,
or both? And how, if at all, are facts about the history of the agents
involved or the background conditions against which they operate
relevant to assessing charges of exploitation?

Externalism and Self-Knowledge,0.7825040817260742,0.4168350398540497,"

Externalism in the philosophy of mind contends that the meaning or
content of a
 thought[1]
 is partly determined by the environment. The view has garnered
attention since it denies the traditional assumption, associated with
Descartes, that thought content is fixed independently of the external
world. Apparently under this assumption, Descartes also believed that
he could know the content of his thoughts while suspending all
judgment about his environs. (Indeed, such knowledge was thought
indubitable.) Yet if externalism is correct, this may well be a
mistake. As we shall see, externalism can suggest that Descartes is
unable to know that his own thought represents, say, elm trees (vs.
beech trees) without knowing that it is elms (and not
beeches) that the thought is connected to in the world. But if such
worldly knowledge is a prerequisite, then Descartes could not know the
content of this thought just “from the armchair,” so to
speak. So there seems to be a conflict between externalism and such
armchair knowledge of one’s own thought contents (for short:
“armchair self-knowledge”). The question whether this
conflict is real is what drives the contemporary debate on externalism
and self-knowledge.

Officially, we can put the issue in terms of an apparent tension
between the following:



(EXT)
Thought content is determined partly by the
 environment.[2]


(SK)
A subject can know from the armchair what content her thoughts
 have.[3]




The issue is that EXT seemingly implies that knowing about content
requires knowing about the environment. And since the latter is
empirical, so too would be the former, contra
 SK.[4]
 Now it is usually thought that, if EXT is incompatible with SK, this
would be a serious problem for EXT (though some think internalism also
conflicts with SK; see McLaughlin & Tye 1998a, Farkas 2003, Bar-On
2006, p. 434). Yet some think the incompatibility threatens SK instead
of EXT (see section
 2.4).
 Regardless, the interest in the debate goes beyond EXT, for it
pertains to many central concerns of philosophers, such as the nature
of knowledge and the relation between mind and world. The debate also
touches on more specialized topics, including memory, concept
acquisition, epistemic responsibility, and transcendental
arguments.

In the standard terminology, the dispute is between
incompatibilists who affirm the conflict between EXT and SK,
and compatibilists who deny it. Incompatibilists have pressed
the conflict mainly in two ways. The first way, discussed in section
2, is by a reductio ad absurdum: Incompatibilists argue that EXT plus
SK entail the absurdity that one can know just from the armchair
contingent facts about the external world. The second way, discussed
in section 3, features a thought experiment about “slow
switching” between two environments. Incompatibilists argue that
such thought experiments show that EXT precludes SK. In section 4, we
will end with some lesser-known issues for externalist
self-knowledge.

We have some of our properties purely in virtue of the way we are.
(Our mass is an example.) We have other properties in virtue of the
way we interact with the world. (Our weight is an example.) The former
are the intrinsic properties, the latter are the extrinsic properties.
This seems to be an intuitive enough distinction to grasp, and hence
the intuitive distinction has made its way into many discussions in
philosophy, including discussions in ethics, philosophy of mind,
metaphysics, epistemology and philosophy of physics. Unfortunately,
when we look more closely at the intuitive distinction, we find reason
to suspect that it conflates a few related distinctions, and that each
of these distinctions is somewhat resistant to analysis.

Abraham Ibn Ezra,0.572090208530426,0.14908358454704285,"

 
All histories of Jewish philosophy include an entry on Abraham Ibn
Ezra, and, judging from his impact on the field, he certainly deserves
the recognition that he has received. Just how he earned it, however,
poses a difficult historical problem. Ibn Ezra contributed virtually
nothing to any of the branches of philosophy; he authored little in
the way of strictly philosophical tracts and, indeed, there is no
reason for us to suppose that he enjoyed any rigorous training in
philosophy.  Yet he certainly left his mark on Jewish thought, and his
pronouncements are recorded and treated with respect by those who came
after him.


Ibn Ezra's philosophical legacy consists in the main of the following,
rather short list of doctrines. The deity governs the terrestrial
world by means of the heavenly bodies. Humans toil under astral
destiny; though the stars are subservient, formally at least, to God,
their domination over the material universe is for all practical
purposes complete. Neither the precise structure of the human soul,
nor the mode of its bonding with the body, may be known with
certainty.  However, one component or aspect of the human soul is of
the same fiber as the supernal realm that is above the stars; nothing
in existence is more similar to God. Nurturing this spiritual
component offers the one hope of refuge from this world. Ibn Ezra's
poetry in particular gives very powerful expression to the themes of
the soul's alienation and longing to return to its heavenly abode. To
be sure, weighty questions are involved in all of these teachings, but
Ibn Ezra does not take any of them up in depth.


In sum, it appears that Ibn Ezra, much like Sa‘adiah—the
Jewish thinker who influenced him most strongly—adopted a mix of
kalam and philosophical doctrines. There simply is no evidence that he
trained in philosophy or studied anything more than a small sampling
of the literature available in his day, which was considerable. His
acknowledged sources are nearly all brief, gaonic, writings, which
display the first grapplings of medieval Jewry with theological
issues.


Nonetheless, Ibn Ezra achieved the status of the sage whose remarks,
curt and enigmatic thought they may be, carry weight and authority. In
a way, his role in philosophy, or, perhaps better put, in spreading
certain philosophical teachings, is not that different from the one he
played in mathematics, astronomy, and astrology. His copious writings
on those subjects are not distinguished by any depth or originality;
yet there can be no doubt that their role was pivotal in the spread of
knowledge throughout Europe, most especially within the Jewish
communities, though by no means limited to them. While not pretending
to offer a complete and completely satisfying answer, we suggest a
combination of factors that facilitated his success: industriousness,
wide travels, the very popular vehicle of bible commentary, rational
thought that gives a prominent place to astrology, and a soteriology
that focuses upon the individual rather than the collective.

they make truth-bearers true and correspond to truths, they are part

Faith,0.6946709752082825,0.7906947731971741,"

What is faith? This entry focusses on the nature of faith,
although issues about the justifiability of faith are also
implicated.

‘Faith’is a broad term, appearing in locutions that
express a range of different concepts. At its most general
‘faith’ means much the same as ‘trust’. This
entry is specifically concerned, however, with the notion of
religious faith—or, rather (and this qualification is
important), the kind of faith exemplified in religious faith.
Philosophical accounts are almost exclusively about theistic
religious faith—faith in God—and they generally, though
not exclusively, deal with faith as understood within the Christian
branch of the Abrahamic traditions. But, although the theistic
religious context settles what kind of faith is of interest, the
question arises whether faith of that same general kind also
belongs to other, non-theistic, religious contexts, or to contexts not
usually thought of as religious at all. Arguably, it may be apt to
speak of the faith of a humanist, or even an atheist, using the same
general sense of ‘faith’ as applies to the theist
case.

The present discussion focuses on theistic religious faith as a
paradigm of the kind of faith that is of interest, though the question
of faith outside this context is taken up in the final Section (11).
Philosophical reflection on theistic religious faith has produced
different accounts or models of its nature. This entry suggests that
there are several key components that may feature, with varying
emphases, in models of faith—in particular, the
affective, the cognitive, the evaluative
and the practical (or, as some may say, the
volitional). It suggests also that there is a variety of
different principles according to which models of faith may be
categorized, including

how the model relates faith as a state to the active components
associated with faith;
whether the model takes the object of faith to be exclusively
propositional or not;
the type of epistemology with which the model is associated—
whether it is broadly ‘evidentialist’ or
‘fideist’;
whether the model is necessarily restricted to theistic religious
faith, or may extend beyond it.


There is no single ‘established’ terminology for different
models of faith. A brief initial characterisation of the principal
models of faith and their nomenclature as they feature in this
discussion may nevertheless be helpful—they are:

the ‘purely affective’ model: faith as a
feeling of existential confidence
the ‘special knowledge’ model: faith as
knowledge of specific truths, revealed by God
the ‘belief’ model: faith as belief
that God exists (where the object of belief is a certain
proposition)
the ‘trust’ model: faith as believing
in (in the sense of trusting in) God (where the object of
belief or trust is not a proposition, but God
‘himself’)
the ‘doxastic venture’ model: faith as
practical commitment beyond the evidence to one’s belief that God
exists
‘sub-’ and ‘non-doxastic venture’
models: faith as practical commitment to a relevant positively
evaluated truth-claim, yet without belief
the ‘hope’ model: faith as hoping—or
acting in the hope that—the God who saves exists.


The entry proceeds dialectically, with later sections presupposing the
earlier discussion.

Shem-Tov ben Joseph ibn Falaquera (ca. 1225–1295), sometime poet

philosophy and is not well known even by students in the field; yet
few medieval Jewish philosophers matched his learning and knowledge of
the writings of the ancient Greek and medieval Islamic and Jewish

Fallacies,0.7960599064826965,0.7608276605606079,"


Two competing conceptions of fallacies are that they are false but
popular beliefs and that they are deceptively bad arguments. These we
may distinguish as the belief and argument conceptions of
fallacies. Academic writers who have given the most attention to the
subject of fallacies insist on, or at least prefer, the argument
conception of fallacies, but the belief conception is prevalent in
popular and non-scholarly discourse. As we shall see, there are yet
other conceptions of what fallacies are, but the present inquiry
focuses on the argument conception of fallacies.
 

Being able to detect and avoid fallacies has been viewed as a
supplement to criteria of good reasoning. The knowledge of fallacies is
needed to arm us against the most enticing missteps we might take with
arguments—so thought not only Aristotle but also the early
nineteenth century logicians Richard Whately and John Stuart Mill. But
as the course of logical theory from the late nineteenth-century
forward turned more and more to axiomatic systems and formal
languages, the study of reasoning and natural language argumentation
received much less attention, and hence developments in the study of
fallacies almost came to a standstill. Until well past the middle of
the twentieth century, discussions of fallacies were for the most part
relegated to introductory level textbooks. It was only when
philosophers realized the ill fit between formal logic, on the one
hand, and natural language reasoning and argumentation, on the other,
that the interest in fallacies has returned. Since the 1970s the
utility of knowing about fallacies has been acknowledged (Johnson and
Blair 1993), and the way in which fallacies are incorporated into
theories of argumentation has been taken as a sign of a theory’s level
of adequacy (Biro and Siegel 2007, van Eemeren 2010).


In modern fallacy studies it is common to distinguish formal and
informal fallacies. Formal fallacies are those readily seen to be
instances of identifiable invalid logical forms such as undistributed
middle and denying the antecedent. Although many of the informal
fallacies are also invalid arguments, it is generally thought to be
more profitable, from the points of view of both recognition and
understanding, to bring their weaknesses to light through analyses
that do not involve appeal to formal languages. For this reason it has
become the practice to eschew the symbolic language of formal logic in the
analysis of these fallacies; hence the term ‘informal
fallacy’ has gained wide currency. In the following essay, which
is in four parts, it is what is considered the informal-fallacy
literature that will be reviewed. Part 1 is an introduction to the
core fallacies as brought to us by the tradition of the
textbooks. Part 2 reviews the history of the development of the conceptions of
fallacies as it is found from Aristotle to Copi. Part 3 surveys some
of the most recent innovative research on fallacies, and Part 4
considers some of the current research topics in fallacy theory.

Fatalism,0.7236937880516052,0.6159753799438477,"
 Though the word “fatalism” is commonly used to refer
to an attitude of resignation in the face of some future event or
events which are thought to be inevitable, philosophers usually use
the word to refer to the view that we are powerless to do anything
other than what we actually do. This view may be argued for in various
ways: by appeal to logical laws and metaphysical necessities; by
appeal to the existence and nature of God; by appeal to causal
determinism. When argued for in the first way, it is commonly called
“Logical fatalism” (or, in some cases, “Metaphysical
fatalism”); when argued for in the second way, it is commonly
called “Theological fatalism”. When argued for in the
third way it is not now commonly referred to as “fatalism”
at all, and such arguments will not be discussed here.


The interest in arguments for fatalism lies at least as much in the
question of how the conclusion may be avoided as in the question of
whether it is true.

Federalism,0.41576820611953735,0.6799474358558655,"


Federalism is the theory or advocacy of federal principles for
dividing powers between member units and common institutions. Unlike
in a unitary state, sovereignty in federal political orders is
non-centralized, often constitutionally, between at least two levels
so that units at each level have final authority and can be self
governing in some issue area. Citizens thus have political obligations
to, or have their rights secured by, two authorities. The division of
power between the member unit and center may vary, typically the
center has powers regarding defense and foreign policy, but member
units may also have international roles. The decision-making bodies of
member units may also participate in central decision-making
bodies. Much recent philosophical attention is spurred by renewed
political interest in federalism and backlashes against particular instances, coupled with empirical findings concerning the requisite and legitimate basis for stability and trust among citizens in federal political orders. Philosophical
contributions have addressed the dilemmas and opportunities facing
Canada, Australia, Europe, Russia, Iraq, Nepal and Nigeria, to mention
just a few areas where federal arrangements are seen as interesting
solutions to accommodate differences among populations divided by
ethnic or cultural cleavages yet seeking a common, often democratic,
political order.

Margaret Fell,0.6040773391723633,0.6717096567153931,"


On the strength of her 1666 pamphlet, Womens Speaking
Justified, the Quaker writer Margaret Fell has been hailed as a
feminist pioneer. In this short tract, Fell puts forward several
arguments in favour of women's preaching. She asserts the
spiritual equality of the sexes, she appeals to female exempla in the
Bible, and she reinterprets key scriptural passages that appear to
endorse women's subordination to men. Some scholars, however,
have questioned Fell's status as a feminist thinker. They point
to the fact that, according to Fell and her fellow Quakers, women are
permitted to speak in church—but only in so far as they are
vessels or mouthpieces for Christ. In every other respect, it is
argued, the early Quakers continue to either ignore, denigrate, or
efface the female sex. Other critics point out that the Quakers'
gender egalitarian principles operate in a rather limited sphere of
activity—that of religious worship alone—and do not extend
to the socio-political domain. Notwithstanding such criticisms,
Fell's defence of women's preaching was undoubtedly
influential in her time and may have inspired women writers beyond her
religious circle. Foxton (1994) claims that Quaker women's
writings more generally set an important precedent for women's
publishing activities in the seventeenth century, on both religious and
non-religious topics.

pragmatist philosophy, along with other various orientations and
intersections. As they do so, they are also intervening in how
longstanding basic philosophical problems are understood. As feminist
philosophers carry out work in traditional philosophical fields, from
ethics to epistemology, they have introduced new concepts and
perspectives that have transformed philosophy itself. They are also
rendering philosophical previously un-problematized topics, such as
the body, class and work, disability, the family, reproduction, the
self, sex work, human trafficking, and sexuality. And they are
bringing a particularly feminist lens to issues of science,
globalization, human rights, popular culture, and race and racism.

Analytic feminists are philosophers who believe that both philosophy
and feminism are well served by using some of the concepts, theories,
and methods of analytic philosophy modified by feminist values and
insights. By using ‘analytic feminist’ to characterize
their style of feminist philosophizing, these philosophers acknowledge
their dual feminist and analytic roots and their intention to
participate in the ongoing conversations within both traditions. In
addition, the use of ‘analytic feminist’ attempts to rebut
two frequently made presumptions: that feminist philosophy is entirely
 postmodern and that analytic philosophy is irredeemably
 male-biased.[1]
 Thus by naming themselves analytic feminists, these philosophers
affirm the existence and political value of their work.

[Editor's Note: The following new entry by Jennifer Hansen replaces the

Continental feminism denotes a branch of feminist philosophy that
draws on theoretical concepts and methods from the continental
tradition. Continental feminists adapt three main methodological
tools—postmodernism, psychoanalysis, and phenomenology—to
unearth sexist commitments in: (1) contemporary social problems and
(2) the field of philosophy. 


While it is no easy task to characterize the heterogeneity of
projects gathered under the heading of continental feminist philosophy,
one can delineate two broad aims: deconstructive (critical) projects
and reconstructive projects. In the former case, continental feminists
draw on the tools and methodological approaches of postmodernism and
psychoanalysis to uncover the sexist, racist, and homophobic core of
Western thought. In the latter case, adapting phenomenological
approaches, continental feminists develop new, more inclusive concepts
of identity, agency, sexuality, race, and power. Their
reconstructive projects also introduce helpful models for clarifying
the nature of contemporary political and social problems.

Intersections Between Analytic and Continental Feminism,0.6117737889289856,0.6767232418060303,"

Continental and analytic approaches to feminism differ primarily in
the theoretical resources to which they appeal: analytic approaches
typically take their starting point from the English-speaking world
– Frege, Russell, Moore et al. – while continental
approaches typically take theirs either from Germany – Hegel,
Marx, the Frankfurt School et al. – or from France –
Lacan, Kristeva, Saussure, Derrida et al. But feminist philosophers
are rarely wedded to one tradition over the other; quite the contrary:
their work presents a good case for the theoretical advantages of
crossing the lines between analytic and continental philosophy and
between the two branches of continental feminism. Indeed, feminists
oriented by German philosophical traditions are often closer to those
oriented by Anglo-American traditions than they are to those oriented
by French ones. Moreover, both analytic and continental feminists look
to the French philosopher, Simone de Beauvoir’s work and both find
theoretical resources in the works of J.L. Austin and Michel Foucault.
Although this entry distinguishes broadly analytic and broadly
continental feminist traditions, it also tries to clarify
intersections, overlaps and the ways in which analytic and continental
feminists build on one another’s work. The entry focuses on
three topics common to the two traditions: problems of who or what
women are, issues pertaining to freedom and domination, and questions
of epistemic injustice.

Intersections Between Pragmatist and Continental Feminism,0.6377283930778503,0.6706115007400513,"


Given the occasional confusion of the colloquial and the
philosophical senses of the term “pragmatism” and the
slipperiness of the term “continental” (or
“postmodern”) philosophy, a word about the two fields is in
order before turning to feminist approaches to their intersections. The
so-called classical period of American philosophy, best known for its
creation of American pragmatism, was developed in the United States
from the late nineteenth to the middle of the twentieth century by
figures such as Jane Addams, W.E.B. Du Bois, John Dewey, William James,
Alain Locke, George Herbert Mead, Charles Sanders Peirce, Josiah Royce,
and Alfred North
 Whitehead.[1]
 Waning in popularity after the Second World War, American pragmatist
philosophy experienced a revival in the 1970s, often credited to the
“neo-pragmatist” work of Richard Rorty (see especially
Rorty 1979), that continues today. Far from being an anti-theoretical
position that champions level-headed practicality as is sometimes
thought, pragmatist philosophy stresses the dynamic relationship
between theory and practice and especially the value of each for
transforming the other. It seeks to undermine other sharp dichotomies
as well, including those between body and mind, subject and object,
ends and means, and nature and culture. Viewing knowledge as a tool
for enriching experience, pragmatism tends to be pluralistic,
experimental, fallibilist, and naturalistic. Rejecting the quest for
absolute certainty, it takes a meliorist attitude that human action
sometimes can improve the world.


Pragmatism's emphasis on experience, developed in the wake of Darwin's
evolutionary theory, perhaps best distinguishes it from other
philosophical fields. Pragmatism demands that philosophy grow out of
and test its merits in the “soil” of lived
experience. This is not to abjure abstraction, but rather to insist
that philosophy deal with the genuine problems of living organisms,
not the artificial problems of an academic discipline. It is important
to realize, however, that pragmatists understand the concept of
experience as “double-barrelled,” in James's words (James
quoted in Dewey 2000, 463). Experience refers not only to the
so-called “subjective” experience of a living being, but
also to the “objective” world that is experienced by
it. Biology and evolutionary theory teach that plants and non-human
animals cannot live apart from the environments that feed and sustain
them. Pragmatist philosophy incorporates this lesson by insisting that
all of experience, including human experience, needs to be understood
as an interaction between organism and environment.  Functional
distinctions can be made between the two, but for pragmatism, no sharp
dichotomy between them exists.


Somewhat ironically, the concept of continental philosophy is a
creation of philosophers in the United States who focus on the work of
post-Enlightenment European thinkers, especially those in France and
Germany. While the range of European figures studied by continental
philosophers is too large and varied to list comprehensively here, one
could say that it begins with nineteenth century theorists such as
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Søren Kierkegaard, Karl Marx, and
Friedrich Nietzsche; continues with twentieth century thinkers such as
Theodor Adorno, Louis Althusser, Walter Benjamin, Simone de Beauvoir,
Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Sigmund Freud, Hans-Georg Gadamer,
Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, Jacques Lacan, Jean-François
Lyotard, Herbert Marcuse, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jean-Paul Sartre;
and extends into the twenty-first century with contemporary writers
such as Pierre Bourdieu, Jacques Derrida, Jürgen Habermas, Julia
Kristeva, and Luce Irigaray.


Since the specific fields represented by these theorists range from
genealogical philosophy, phenomenology, existentialism, and critical
theory to deconstruction, hermeneutics, post-structuralism, and
psychoanalytic philosophy, the label “continental” must be
understood more as an umbrella concept than a precise term.
Nevertheless, contemporary continental philosophies can be seen as
sharing a suspicion of what Lyotard (1984) has called “grand
narratives,” which are accounts of the world and human existence
that (attempt to) legitimate and provide them with meaning from a
position external to them. Some examples of grand narratives under
attack by continental philosophers include the idea that facts and
values are sharply opposed to one another, the assumption that the self
is essentially unified, and the belief that the pursuit of knowledge is
for its own sake rather than driven by particular human interests. A
rejection of grand narratives does not entail the inability to make
distinctions, such as those between fact and value, knowledge and
politics, insider and outside, and thing and process. It instead means
understanding those distinctions as made from a particular perspective
and within a particular context, and remaining open to the criticism
and possible rejection of them if they fail to serve the purposes for
which they were selected. Uncovering the failings and internal
inconsistencies of the grand narratives of the Western world,
continental philosophy thus attempts to construct a way of doing
philosophy that resists appeal to absolute and unquestionable starting
points, methods, or concepts. Its outlook tends to be historical and
perspectival, emphasizing the co-constitutive relationship of power and
social-political location, on the one hand, and knowledge and truth, on
the other.


In its perspectival, historical, and contextual approaches to
philosophy, continental theory finds significant points of contact not
only with American pragmatism, but also with much of contemporary
feminist philosophy. In general and especially when influenced by
continental and pragmatist philosophy, feminist philosophy can be seen
as targeting the grand narratives of patriarchy and male privilege,
arguing that many of the so-called objective and universal truths of
philosophy are instead pronouncements made from a particular — that
is, male-biased — point of view. Above all, as this essay will reveal,
the dual impact of continental and pragmatist philosophy contributes to
a feminism that challenges the philosophical construction of sharp
dichotomies and opposed binaries. Such a challenge is feminist because
even when dualisms do not explicitly refer to women, gender, or
sexuality, they tend to be implicated in and to produce male
privilege.


In spite of many affinities between pragmatist, continental, and
feminist philosophy, there currently are very few feminists whose work
is recognized as explicitly incorporating both of the other traditions.
Instead, what one generally finds is a handful of feminists well known
for working out of a continental tradition who also, but in a less
recognized fashion, draw from pragmatist themes and figures. In what
follows, I discuss five themes that emerge in the work of feminists
customarily associated with continental philosophy to illuminate the
particular way that each combines pragmatist and continental thought. I
then close with suggestions of additional resources for feminists
interested in the intersection of pragmatist and continental philosophy
and suggestions of possible future directions that the young field
might take.

Pragmatist Feminism,0.6142104268074036,0.7356594800949097,"

Pragmatist feminism is a developing field of philosophy that emerged
in the 1990s as a new approach to feminist philosophy. It utilizes and
integrates core concepts of pragmatism, including its emphasis on
pluralism, lived experience and public philosophy, with feminist
theory and practice in order to engage in social issues. Pragmatist
feminist philosophers have been addressing several different projects
over the past decades, including a) the recovery of women who were
influential in the development of American pragmatism but whose work
subsequently all but disappeared in the history of philosophy, b) a
rereading of the “canon” of pragmatist philosophers,
analyzing their writing in light of their philosophies and attitudes
about women, and c) the utilization of pragmatist philosophies as a
resource for contemporary feminist philosophy and activism. The late
20th century saw a resurgence of interest in American
pragmatist philosophy, and part of the energy of that resurgence is
due to feminist interest in pragmatism.

What is now called “classical” American pragmatism is a
grouping of philosophies that developed between the late nineteenth
and the early twentieth century and were largely influential from the
Progressive Era (1890–1915) up until the Second World War.
Pragmatists, such as John Dewey, William James, and Jane Addams, were
interested in the intersection of theory and practice, bringing
philosophic thinking into relationship with the social and political
environment. For these thinkers, philosophizing was an active process,
both as a way to change social realities and to use experience to
modify the philosophies themselves. Early pragmatists were often
humanists; they saw the social environment as malleable, capable of
improvement through human action and philosophic thought. Because of
this, many of the classical pragmatists were engaged in social action,
often participating in experiments in education and working for
egalitarian social reforms. Both early and contemporary pragmatists
reject the idea of a certain Truth that can be discovered through
logical analysis or revelation, and are more interested in knowledge
gained through experiences of all sorts, while emphasizing the social
context of all epistemological claims. Pluralism is a central value
for pragmatists, who understand that knowledge is shaped by multiple
experiential viewpoints. As such, women’s experiences are an
essential part of pragmatist philosophy. Feminist pragmatists use
pragmatist thought as a base for feminist theory. By engaging both
biographical and theoretical approaches, they seek to illuminate the
connections between feminism and pragmatism as activist-orientated
philosophies. These efforts are consistent with feminist methodology;
they utilize personal experiences as well as published work that
focuses on embodied living in a social organism in order to address
contemporary feminist social and political concerns.

It is important to note that we often have to look beyond academic
philosophy to find the women who were influential social philosophers.
In an attempt to expand our methods of philosophy, and to think in new
ways, understanding these reformers as philosophers can be useful in
seeing ways that those outside of modern, professional,
academic settings have held and expressed ideas; doing so can
illuminate how philosophers today might span the boundaries between
scholarship and activism, between philosophy and other disciplines,
and between the academy and the community. As Elizabeth Kamarck
Minnich said, this opens a “new space for thinking” in
philosophy. A call to reappropriate these figures can be seen in the
burgeoning scholarship on feminist pragmatism today as well as in the
renewed emphasis on public and engaged philosophy (Lake 2014;
Hamington & Bardwell-Jones 2012; Yun Lee 2011). Thus, this entry
will first consider the influence of particular women in the classical
pragmatist era, then highlight feminist rereadings of classical
pragmatist work, and finally note how contemporary pragmatist feminist
philosophers are drawing upon the work of early pragmatist feminist
writers in order to pursue projects within epistemology, education,
social action, diversity, and democracy.

Psychoanalytic Feminism,0.6390683650970459,0.6562437415122986,"


This article will discuss psychoanalytic feminism, not feminist
psychoanalysis (i.e., except indirectly, it will not address ideas
about developing feminist principles in clinical practice, although
most of the authors discussed below are trained analysts).
Psychoanalysis develops a theory of the unconscious that links
sexuality and subjectivity ineluctably together. In doing so, it
discloses the ways in which our sense of self, and our political
loyalties and attachments, are influenced by unconscious drives and
ordered by symbolic structures that are beyond the purview of
individual agency. It might appear at the outset that any
alliance between feminism and psychoanalysis would have to be
coordinated on treacherous ground: in Sigmund Freud's
lecture on “Femininity,” for instance, while discussing the
“riddle of femininity” (Freud 1968 [1933], 116) or of
sexual differentiation, Freud's rhetoric impeaches women as
“the problem” (113) and excuses members of his audience
from this indictment by offering the hope that they are “more
masculine than feminine” (117). Many feminists have been
wary both of the biases contained in Freud's oratory and of the
overt content of his claims. This article will explain how and
why feminist theory has, nonetheless, undertaken a serious reading of
Freud and developed careful analyses of his fundamental concepts,
working out their limits, impasses, and possibilities.


In the same essay cited above, Freud writes that
“psychoanalysis does not try to describe what a woman is—that
would be a task it could scarcely perform—but sets about enquiring
how she comes into being, how a woman develops out of a child with a
bisexual disposition” (Freud 1968 [1933], 116). In using
the term ‘bisexual,’ Freud refers to a quality of the
sexual instinct, not a relation to a sexual object (which would be
denoted by the term ‘inversion’); the bisexual child is one
who psychically is not yet either a man or a woman, whose instinctual
life functions prior to sexual difference. Freud here portrays
femininity as one trajectory of the Oedipal Complex and indicates that
sexed identity is a fragile achievement rather than a natural given or
essence. By circumscribing the terrain on which the
psychoanalytic account of sexual difference moves, and by seeing
unresolved, even unresolvable, riddles where others might see the work
of nature or culture, Freud problematizes any causal, seamless, or
direct tie between sex, sexuality, and sexual difference.
Psychoanalytic inquiry does not fit comfortably with, and even
unsettles, biological theories of sex and sociological theories of
gender, thus also complicating the sex/gender distinction as it has
often been formulated in feminist debates. While sex and gender
are sometimes construed in feminist theory in terms of the contrast
between biology and culture, or nature and nurture, Freud's
theory, as discussed below, challenges these dualisms, developing an
account of the sexual drive that traverses the mental and the physical,
and undergoes idiosyncratic vicissitudes rather than assuming a uniform
anatomical or social shape. Whatever the hazards of Freud's
writings on women, then, his work explores in new ways the meaning and
possibilities of sexed identity. Likewise, as I will argue below,
psychoanalytic feminism interrupts many assumptions about what feminism
is and the conceptual and material objects it theorizes, including
especially the very concept of woman. In unsettling our
understanding of this concept, psychoanalysis also poses questions to
feminism about the value of difference and the quest for equality, and
the unresolved tensions between these divergent pursuits.


While there is no doubt a vast ouvre of disparate positions
that might fall within the framework of psychoanalytic feminism, what
is shared in common is a descent from, respect for, and some minimal
borrowing of Freudian accounts of the unconscious, even while
criticizing and/or revising his theoretical apparatus. Any
properly psychoanalytic theory must at the least offer an account of
the unconscious and its bond with sexuality and, arguably, death.
Precisely this descent, however, has also provided a barrier to
feminist deployment since Freud is sometimes read, at least
superficially, as proffering misogynist, and perhaps Procrustean,
elaborations of psychic structuration, curtailing and diminishing the
diversity of individual women's experiences into a restricted and
unvarying formula that will fit within its own theoretical
parameters. Nevertheless, Freud's reflections and
hypotheses concerning hysteria, the Oedipal Complex, female sexuality
and femininity, and women's role in civilization, among other
ideas, have provided the volatile grounds, the sites of contention, for
feminist re-articulation. Before any of the multiple and
divergent articulations of psychoanalytic feminism can be discussed in
more detail, we must thus first establish their historical roots and
the conceptual terrain on which they arise. Since a great deal of
psychoanalytic feminist theory is specifically concerned with revising
the Oedipal narrative of Freud, this article will devote particular
attention to Freud's theories of the unconscious as they pertain
to the Oedipal Complex.

Feminist Environmental Philosophy,0.5970351696014404,0.7304290533065796,"
 Early positions of “feminist environmental philosophy”
focused mostly on ethical perspectives on the interconnections among
women, nonhuman animals, and nature (e.g., Carol Adams 1990; Deborah
Slicer 1991). As it matured, references to feminist environmental
philosophy became what it is now—an umbrella term for a variety
of different, sometimes incompatible, philosophical perspectives on
interconnections among women of diverse races/ethnicities,
socioeconomic statuses, and geographic locations, on the one hand, and
nonhuman animals and nature, on the other. For the purposes of this
essay, “feminist environmental philosophy” refers to this
diversity of positions on the interconnections among women, nonhuman
animals and nature within Western philosophy—what will be
called, simply, “women-nature connections”. Unless
specifically or separately identified, nonhuman animals are included

Feminist History of Philosophy,0.6145499348640442,0.6911152601242065,"


The past twenty-five years have seen an explosion of feminist writing on the
philosophical canon, a development that has clear parallels in other
disciplines like literature and art history. Since most of the writing
is, in one way or another, critical of the tradition, a natural
question to ask is: Why does the history of philosophy have importance
for feminist philosophers? This question assumes that the history of
philosophy is of importance for feminists, an assumption that is
warranted by the sheer volume of recent feminist writing on the canon.
This entry explores the different ways that feminist philosophers are
interacting with the Western philosophical tradition. 


Feminist philosophers engaged in a project of re-reading and
re-forming the philosophical canon have noticed two significant areas
of concern. The first is the problem of historical exclusion. Feminist
philosophers are faced with a tradition that believes that there are no
women philosophers and, if there are any, they are unimportant. Of
course, women are not entirely absent from the history of philosophy,
and that brings us to the second challenge we face. Canonical
philosophers have had plenty to say about women and what we are like.
In general terms, we often find that philosophical norms like reason
and objectivity are defined in contrast to matter, the irrational or
whatever a given philosopher associates with women and the feminine.
Our tradition tells us, either implicitly through images and metaphors,
or explicitly in so many words, that philosophy itself, and its norms
of reason and objectivity, exclude everything that is feminine or
associated with women.


In response, feminist philosophers have criticized both the
historical exclusion of women from the philosophical tradition, and the
negative characterization of women or the feminine in it. Feminist
historians of philosophy have argued that the historical record is
incomplete because it omits women philosophers, and it is biased
because it devalues any women philosophers it forgot to omit. In
addition, feminist philosophers have argued that the philosophical
tradition is conceptually flawed because of the way that its
fundamental norms like reason and objectivity are gendered
male.[1]
 By means of these criticisms, feminist
philosophers are enlarging the philosophical canon and re-evaluating
its norms, in order to include women in the philosophical “us”.


The following entry contains 4 major sections. Section 1 (“Feminist
Criticisms of the Canon as Misogynist”) describes feminist readings of
the philosophical canon that challenge its derogatory characterizations
of women. These are of three kinds: (a) readings that record the
explicit misogyny of great philosophers (like Aristotle's description
of a female as a deformed male); (b) readings that argue for gendered
interpretations of theoretical concepts (like matter and form in
Aristotle); (c) synoptic interpretations of the canon (like the view
that, historically, reason and objectivity are gendered male). The
third category of feminist criticisms of the canon diagnoses where
philosophy as a whole went most deeply wrong, and, in doing so, it
constructs a negative canon of philosophy. The negative canon exposes
the ways in which the views of canonical philosophers throughout the
history of philosophy are explicitly or implicitly misogynist or
sexist. Section 2 (“Feminist Revisions of the History of Philosophy”)
discusses the response of feminist philosophy to the myths that there
are no women philosophers and, in any case, no important ones. One
response has been the retrieval of women philosophers for the
historical record. A related development is the elevation to the canon
of women philosophers like Mary Wollstonecraft, Hannah Arendt and
Simone de Beauvoir. Finally, feminist revisions to the history of 
philosophy and the canon raise important and pressing questions 
concerning how to weave women philosophers securely into the story 
of philosophy so that they begin to appear in the philosophical 
curriculum.  Section 3 (“Feminist Appropriation of Canonical
Philosophers”) examines the way that feminist philosophers have been
engaged in rereading the canon looking for antecedents to feminist
philosophy in the work of those philosophers (e.g. Hume) and those
theories (e.g. Arisotle's virtue ethics) that are most congenial to
current trends in feminism or which provide most fuel for feminist
thought. This is to use the canon as other movements have done—as a
resource, and as confirmation that a feminist perspective or problem is
securely rooted in our philosophical culture. Section 4 (Feminist 
Methodological Reflections on the History of Philosophy) discusses 
the methodological issues raised by feminist work on the history of 
philosophy.  Feminists who are critical of traditional methods of 
reading the history of philosophy have proposed several alternative 
reading strategies that they argue are better suited to feminist 
purposes than traditional methods.  These writers are particularly 
skeptical of the appropriation project outlined in section 3 and 
their skepticism provokes interesting questions about what it is 
we do when we do the history of philosophy.

Liberal Feminism,0.6062005758285522,0.6967556476593018,"


Liberals hold that freedom is a fundamental value, and that the just
state ensures freedom for individuals. Liberal feminists share this
view, and insist on freedom for women. There is disagreement among
liberals about what freedom means, and thus liberal feminism takes more
than one form. This entry discusses two basic kinds of liberal
feminism. Part one discusses what, in the philosophical literature, is
commonly called simply ‘liberal feminism.’ Liberal feminism
conceives of freedom as personal autonomy—living a life of one's
own choosing—and political autonomy—being co-author of
the conditions under which one lives. Part two discusses what is
commonly called ‘classical-liberal feminism,’ or sometimes
‘libertarian feminism’ (these terms will be used
interchangeably
 here).[1]
 Classical-liberal or libertarian feminism
conceives of freedom as freedom from coercive interference. While
liberal feminism is established in academic philosophy, much of the
classical-liberal or libertarian feminist literature is oriented
towards a more popular audience. (Note that there is dispute over
whether classical-liberal or libertarian feminism ought to be
considered a version of liberal feminism (see section 2.7)).

Feminist Metaphysics,0.6400194764137268,0.6983344554901123,"

Metaphysics is the study of the basic structure of reality, of what
there is and what it is like. It considers, for example, concepts such
as identity, causation, substance, and
kind, that seem to be presupposed by any form of inquiry; and
it attempts to determine what there is at the most general level. For
example, are there minds in addition to bodies? Do things persist
through change? Is there freewill or is all action determined by prior
events? But since metaphysics not only concerns itself with what there
is (ontology), but also the nature of that which exists,
metaphysicians ask, for example, whether numbers, if they exist, are
dependent upon human thought and practices in some way, whether the
concepts and categories we use to think of and describe reality
influence or determine in any way what is described, and whether and
how values are embodied in our categories and descriptions. It should
thus not come as a surprise that there could be a specifically
feminist metaphysics, where the question of prime importance is to
what extent the central concepts and categories of metaphysics, in
terms of which we make sense of our reality, could be value laden in
ways that are particularly gendered.

In this way, feminist theorists have asked whether and, if so, to what
extent our frameworks for understanding the world are distorting in
ways that privilege men or masculinity. What, if anything, is eclipsed
if we adopt an Aristotelian framework of substance and essence, or a
Cartesian framework of immaterial souls present in material bodies?
And is what’s left out of such frameworks relevant to the
devaluation or oppression of women? Feminists have also considered the
structure of social reality and the relationship between the social
world and the natural world. Because social structures are often
justified as natural, or necessary to control what’s natural,
feminists have questioned whether such references to nature are
legitimate. This has led to considerable work on the idea of social
construction and, more specifically, the social construction of
gender.

Feminist Moral Psychology,0.5978466272354126,0.6886448860168457,"


Moral psychology, broadly construed, deals with issues relating to
motivation of moral action. More specifically, it concerns how we
see or fail to see moral issues, why we act or fail to act morally, and
whether and to what extent we are responsible for our actions.
Fundamentally, it is concerned with our moral agency, the kind of
beings we are or ought to be, morally speaking.


Feminist moral psychology deals with what feminists, in particular,
have contributed to the field of moral psychology, or the ways in which
their approach to these issues is motivated by feminist concerns,
especially in connection to understanding and attempting to end
women's oppression. The feminist contribution to moral
psychology has been at least three-fold. First, some feminists
emphasize the role of emotion in action; in particular, they stress the
motive of care in prompting action. They do so for the reason
that emotion in general, and care in particular, have been ignored or
denigrated in traditional moral theory due to their association with
women. They believe that if we are to end women's
oppression, we should incorporate into our philosophical theories
things associated with women and with the feminine and so previously
left out. Other feminists, though, worry about how care in
particular can be harmful to women, and believe that incorporating care
into moral theory will perpetuate women's oppression. Still
other feminists challenge the internalist thesis that motivation is
necessarily present in the rational agent who recognizes a reason to
act morally. Second, feminist attention to oppression has led
those feminists working in the field of moral psychology to acknowledge
the role of systematic oppression in the psychology of both victims of
oppression and oppressors themselves. One issue is the role that
patriarchy plays in a person's motivation and subsequent
action. How does patriarchy affect women's desires?
Can women be autonomous if their desires are deformed by
patriarchy? Does the satisfaction of women's deformed
desires contribute to their own oppression? What motivates those
who perform sexist acts that contribute to women's
oppression? A related issue, the third that feminists working in
the field of moral psychology are concerned with, is that of
responsibility. To what extent are we responsible for our actions
when they are motivated by desires deformed by patriarchy? Are
victims of oppression in any way responsible for their own
oppression? Are they responsible for resisting oppression?
Are members of the dominant social group responsible for understanding
oppression, and how can they come to understand it? Are men
collectively responsible for women's oppression, even when it is
not the case that each man harbors sexist intentions?

Feminist Philosophy of Language,0.6160337328910828,0.6790803670883179,"

Feminist philosophy of language has come a long way in a very short
time period. Initially, most work in the area was critical, calling
for changes either to language itself or to philosophy of language.
More recently, however, the dynamic has changed, with the advent of
several major positive research programmes within philosophy of
language. In this entry, we first discuss the critiques that
constitute the first phase of feminist work in this area, before
moving onto the positive research programmes that have recently come
to the fore. Our focus in this entry will generally be on the analytic
tradition. For continental approaches, see the entries on

Feminist Philosophy of Law,0.6027662754058838,0.6962637305259705,"

Feminist philosophy of law identifies the pervasive influence of
patriarchy and masculinist norms on legal structures and demonstrates
their effects on the material conditions of women and girls and those
who many not conform to cisgender norms. It also considers problems at
the intersection of sexuality and law and develops reforms to correct
gender injustice, exploitation, or restriction. To these ends,
feminist philosophy of law applies insights from feminist
epistemology, relational metaphysics and progressive social ontology,
feminist political theory, and other developments in feminist
philosophy to understand how legal institutions enforce dominant
gendered and masculinist norms. Contemporary feminist philosophy of
law also draws from diverse scholarly perspectives such as
international human rights theory, postcolonial theory, critical legal
studies, critical race theory, queer theory, and disability
studies.

Addressing the goals of feminist philosophy of law requires theory
development, conceptual analysis, and conceptual revision. Promoting
freedom and equality for women reflects a profound shift in basic
assumptions about the nature of women and their proper place in the
world: a shift from inequality to equality of the sexes, along with
re-examination of what equality itself requires. It also requires
re-examination of the understanding of sex, gender, and gender roles.
Given the scope and detail of this change, feminist legal theory
proceeds on multiple levels, from the pragmatic, concrete, and
particular to the conceptual and ultimately visionary. Some of this
writing appears in philosophy journals and monographs, but much also
appears in journals in gender studies and feminism, generalist law
reviews, and the many specialist law journals devoted to issues of
gender and justice. This article begins with a brief overview of
fundamental themes of feminist legal theory, followed by discussion of
the evolution of views about needed institutional changes in several
substantive areas of law:  political equality, immigration, and
citizenship; marriage, reproductive rights, and commodification of the
body; protection from violence; and economic rights.

Feminist Philosophy of Religion,0.6260944008827211,0.6964054703712463,"

Philosophical reflection on religion is as old as Greek questions
about Hebrew stories. Feminist philosophy of religion is a more recent
development within Western philosophy that poses feminist questions
about religious texts, traditions, and practices, often with the aim
of critiquing, redefining, or reconstructing the entire field in light
of gender studies. Feminist philosophy of religion is important to
feminist and nonfeminist philosophy alike for providing a critical
understanding of various religious concepts, beliefs, and rituals, as
well as of religion as a cultural institution that defines, sanctions,
and sometimes challenges gender roles and gender-inflected
representations. It is equally important for feminist theory, which
frequently neglects the academic study of religion, as for analytic
philosophy of religion, which seldom takes into account gender or race
or class. This entry considers the work of both critique and
reconstruction as it has developed in feminist philosophies of
religion over the last several decades.

In the present situation, most practitioners of feminist philosophy of
religion and of feminist theology are agreed that their discipline
cannot be limited simply to a sociological assessment or confessional
narrative of what a particular religious group believes to be true,
without consideration of the difference that gender makes. Because
feminist philosophy of religion is philosophical, it can take
as primary neither the datum of scriptures believed to be revealed and
self-authenticating nor the self-privileging endeavor of intratextual
theologies. Because it is philosophy of religion, a subject
matter that encompasses a broad array of cross-cultural material, it
cannot be concerned simply with themes or questions drawn from the
Christian religion alone. And because it is feminist, it must
promote the elimination of gender inequality and take into account the
multiplicity of human bodies, desires, and differences that are mapped
onto the site of religion. At the same time, it cannot presume that
religion exists as some common universal underlying all the various
traditions; only particular religions exist, and even the very concept
of religion itself has come to be recognized as a modern and Western
concept.

Feminist Political Philosophy,0.613768994808197,0.7040392756462097,"


Feminist political philosophy is an area of philosophy that is in part
focused on understanding and critiquing the way political philosophy
is usually construed—often without any attention to feminist
concerns—and on articulating how political theory might be
reconstructed in a way that advances feminist concerns. Feminist
political philosophy is a branch of both feminist philosophy and
political philosophy. As a branch of feminist philosophy, it serves as
a form of critique or a hermeneutics of suspicion (Ricœur
1970). That is, it serves as a way of opening up or looking at the
political world as it is usually understood and uncovering ways in
which women and their current and historical concerns are poorly
depicted, represented, and addressed. As a branch of political
philosophy, feminist political philosophy serves as a field for
developing new ideals, practices, and justifications for how political
institutions and practices should be organized and reconstructed.


While feminist philosophy has been instrumental in critiquing and
reconstructing many branches of philosophy, from aesthetics to
philosophy of science, feminist political philosophy may be the
paradigmatic branch of feminist philosophy because it best exemplifies
the point of feminist theory, which is, to borrow a phrase from Marx,
not only to understand the world but to change it (Marx and Engels
1998). And, though other fields have effects that may change the
world, feminist political philosophy focuses most directly on
understanding ways in which collective life can be improved. This
project involves understanding the ways in which power
emerges and is used or misused in public life (see the entry on 
 feminist perspectives on power).  
 As with other kinds of feminist theory, common themes have emerged for
discussion and critique, but there has been little in the way of
consensus among feminist theorists on what is the best way to
understand them.  This introductory article lays out the various
schools of thought and areas of concern that have occupied this
vibrant field of philosophy for the past forty years. It understands
feminist philosophy broadly to include work conducted by feminist
theorists doing this philosophical work from other disciplines,
especially political science but also anthropology, comparative

Feminist Perspectives on Autonomy,0.5276300311088562,0.7521422505378723,"

Autonomy is usually understood by feminist writers in the same way
that it is understood within moral psychology generally, namely, as
self-government or self-direction: being autonomous is acting on
motives, reasons, or values that are one's own. Early
feminist literature regarded the notion of autonomy with suspicion
because it was thought to promote unattractive
“masculinist” ideals of personhood; that is, it was
thought to presuppose a conception of the person as
“atomistic”, as ideally self-sufficient, as operating in a
vacuum unaffected by social relationships, or as an abstract reasoner
stripped of distorting influences such as emotions. Recently feminists
have sought to rehabilitate the notion of autonomy. Some have argued
that articulating the conditions of autonomous choice is essential to
understanding gender oppression and related concepts such as
objectification. The challenge facing feminist theorists therefore is
to reconceptualize autonomy from a feminist perspective. The term
“relational autonomy” is often used to refer to
reconceptualizations of the notion of autonomy to contrast feminist
accounts with those that presuppose atomistic conceptions of the
self.

Feminist Perspectives on Class and Work,0.6064425110816956,0.6851918697357178,"

A good place to situate the start of theoretical debates about women,
class and work is in the intersection with Marxism and feminism. Such
debates were shaped not only by academic inquiries but as questions
about the relation between women’s oppression and liberation and
the class politics of the left, trade union and feminist movements in
the late 19th and 20th centuries, particularly
in the U.S., Britain and Europe. It will also be necessary to consider
various philosophical approaches to the concept of work, the way that
women’s work and household activities are subsumed or not under
this category, how the specific features of this work may or may not
connect to different “ways of knowing” and different
approaches to ethics, and the debate between essentialist and social
constructionist approaches to differences between the sexes as a base
for the sexual division of labor in most known human societies.

The relation of women as a social group to the analysis of economic
class has spurred political debates within both Marxist and feminist
circles as to whether women’s movements challenging male
domination can assume a common set of women’s interests across
race, ethnicity, and class. If there are no such interests, on what
can a viable women’s movement be based, and how can it evade
promoting primarily the interests of white middle class and wealthy
women? To the extent to which women do organize themselves as a
political group cutting across traditional class lines, under what
conditions are they a conservative influence as opposed to a
progressive force for social change? If poor and working class
women’s issues are different than middle and upper class
women’s issues, how can middle class women’s movements be
trusted to address them? In addition to these questions, there is a
set of issues related to cross-cultural comparative studies of women,
work and relative power in different societies, as well as analyses of
how women’s work is connected to processes of globalization.

Considerable research in the past 30 years has been devoted to women
and work in the context of shifting divisions of labor globally
(Ehrenreich and Hochschild 2004). Some of this feminist work proceeds
from the development perspectives promoted by the UN and other policy
making institutions (Chen et al 2005), while other research takes a
more critical view (Beneria 2003; Pyle and Ward 2007). Many studies
address changes in the gender division of labor within specific
national economies (Freeman 1999; George 2005; Rofel; Sangster 1995)
while others consider the impact of transnational migration on
women’s class position (Pratt 2004; Romero 1992; Stephen 2007;
Keogh 2015) and women’s opportunities for cross-class solidarity
and grassroots-based organizing (Mohanty 2003). More recent feminist
research has addressed the restructuring of work and its impact on
women and gender culture as an effect of neo-liberal economic
adjustments (Adkins 2002; Enloe 2004; Federici 2008; McRobbie 2002;
Skeggs 2003).

aesthetics, have made important contributions to debates about
globalization, this entry focuses on one subset of these
critiques. Below, we outline the ways in which predominantly
Western feminist political philosophers who explicitly discuss

Feminist Perspectives on Objectification,0.6067134141921997,0.648821234703064,"


Objectification is a notion central to feminist theory. It can be
roughly defined as the seeing and/or treating a person, usually a
woman, as an object. In this entry, the focus is primarily on
sexual objectification, objectification occurring in the sexual realm.
Martha Nussbaum (1995, 257) has identified seven features that are
involved in the idea of treating a person as an object:

instrumentality: the treatment of a person as a tool for
the objectifier's purposes;
denial of autonomy: the treatment of a person as lacking
in autonomy and self-determination;
inertness: the treatment of a person as lacking in
agency, and perhaps also in activity;
fungibility: the treatment of a person as interchangeable
with other objects;
violability: the treatment of a person as lacking in
boundary-integrity;
ownership: the treatment of a person as something that is
owned by another (can be bought or sold);
denial of subjectivity: the treatment of a person as
something whose experiences and feelings (if any) need not be taken
into account.



Rae Langton (2009, 228–229) has added three more features to
Nussbaum's list:

reduction to body: the treatment of a person as
identified with their body, or body parts;
reduction to appearance: the treatment of a
person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the
senses;
silencing: the treatment of a person as if they are
silent, lacking the capacity to speak.



The majority of the thinkers discussing objectification have taken it
to be a morally problematic phenomenon. This is particularly the case
in feminist discussions of pornography. Anti-pornography feminists
Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, influenced by Immanuel Kant's
conception of objectification, have famously argued that, due to men's
consumption of pornography, women as a group are reduced to the status
of mere tools for men's purposes. Moreover, feminists like Sandra Bartky and
Susan Bordo have argued that women are objectified through being excessively
preoccupied with their appearance. Important recent work by feminists
has also been devoted to exploring the connection between objectivity
and objectification. More recently, some thinkers, such as Martha
Nussbaum, have challenged the idea that objectification is a
necessarily negative phenomenon, arguing for the possibility of
positive objectification. While treating a person as an object (in one
or more of the ways mentioned above) is often problematic, Nussbaum
argues that objectification can in some contexts take benign or even
positive forms, and can constitute a valuable and enjoyable part of
our lives. In her forthcoming work, Nancy Bauer questions the very
idea that it makes sense to specify the marks and features of the term
‘objectification’. Such an attempt, she argues, will only distort the
phenomenon in question (2015, forthcoming).

Feminist Perspectives on Power,0.6226199269294739,0.6712889671325684,"

Although any general definition of feminism would no doubt be
controversial, it seems undeniable that much work in feminist theory
is devoted to the tasks of critiquing women’s subordination, analyzing
the intersections between sexism and other forms of subordination such
as racism, heterosexism, and class oppression, and envisioning the
possibilities for both individual and collective resistance to such
subordination. Insofar as the concept of power is central to each of
these theoretical tasks, power is clearly a central concept for
feminist theory as well. And yet, curiously, it is one that is not
often explicitly discussed in feminist work (exceptions include Allen
1998, 1999, Caputi 2013, Hartsock 1983 and 1996, Yeatmann 1997, and
Young 1992). This poses a challenge for assessing feminist
perspectives on power, as those perspectives must first be
reconstructed from discussions of other topics. Nevertheless, it is
possible to identify three main ways in which feminists have
conceptualized power: as a resource to be (re)distributed, as
domination, and as empowerment. After a brief discussion of
theoretical debates amongst social and political theorists over how to
define the concept of power, this entry will survey each of these
feminist conceptions.

Feminist Perspectives on Rape,0.5991506576538086,0.6607780456542969,"

Although the proper definition of ‘rape’ is itself a
matter of some dispute, rape is generally understood to involve sexual
penetration of a person by force and/or without that person's consent.
Rape is committed overwhelmingly by men and boys, usually against
women and girls, and sometimes against other men and boys. (For the
most part, this entry will assume male perpetrators and female
victims.)

Virtually all feminists agree that rape is a grave wrong, one too
often ignored, mischaracterized, and legitimized. Feminists differ,
however, about how the crime of rape is best understood, and about how
rape should be combated both legally and socially.

Feminist Perspectives on Reproduction and the Family,0.5986959338188171,0.70068359375,"


Historically, few of the philosophers who defended justice in the
public political realm argued for just family structures. Instead, most
viewed the family as a separate realm that needed to be protected from
state intrusion. The private sphere and the public sphere were
dichotomized into separate realms with the latter beyond the reach
of public action. Where these philosophers did not legitimate private
power in the family, they simply ignored it.


John Stuart Mill was a notable exception, arguing in The
Subjection of Women, that the inequality of women in the
family was incompatible with their equality in the wider social world.
Consider, he asks, the consequences of “the self-worship, the
unjust self preference” nourished in boys growing up in male
dominated households in which “by the mere fact of being born
male he is by right the superior of all and every one of an entire
half of the human race” (1869, 86–87). How will such
boys grow up into men who treat women as equals? Feminist scholarship
has continued, extended and deepened this attack on the conception of
the family as a private personal realm. Indeed, the idea that
“the personal [that is, the family] is political” is the
core idea of most contemporary feminism.

Feminist Perspectives on Science,0.6236121654510498,0.7095847725868225,"


Feminists have a number of distinct interests in, and perspectives
on, science. The tools of science have been a crucial resource for
understanding the nature, impact, and prospects for changing
gender-based forms of oppression; in this spirit, feminists actively
draw on, and contribute to, the research programs of a wide range of
sciences. At the same time, feminists have identified the sciences as both a
source and a locus of gender inequalities: the institutions of
science have a long tradition of excluding women as practitioners;
feminist critics of science find that women and gender (or, more
broadly, issues of concern to women and sex/gender minorities) are
routinely marginalized as subjects of scientific inquiry, or are
treated in ways that reproduce gender-normative stereotypes; and,
closing the circle, scientific authority has frequently served to
rationalize the kinds of social roles and institutions that feminists
call into question.
 Feminist perspectives on science therefore reflect a broad
spectrum of epistemic attitudes toward and appraisals of
science. These perspectives range from urging the reform of gender
inequities in the institutions of science by calling attention to the
underrepresentation of women or neglected questions while still
embracing the standards and practices of the sciences they engage, to
critical and constructive alternative programs of research that, to
varying degrees, aim at transforming the framework assumptions,
methodologies, substantive content, and epistemic ideals that shape
the sciences. The content of these perspectives, and the degree to
which they generate transformation depends not only on the types of
philosophical and political commitments that inform them but also on
the nature of the sciences and their subject domains. Feminist
perspectives appear to have had greater impact on sciences that deal
with objects of inquiry that are understood as gendered—those in
the social and human sciences—and, secondarily, on sciences
where the objects of inquiry are often characterized in gendered
terms, metaphorically or by analogy (projectively gendered
subjects)—chiefly the biological and life sciences. Feminist
perspectives are relevant to sciences that deal with non-gendered
subject matters, but perspectives vary substantially in content and in
critical import depending on the sciences and the particular research
programs they engage.

Feminism is said to be the movement to end women's oppression (hooks
2000, 26). One possible way to understand ‘woman’ in this
claim is to take it as a sex term: ‘woman’ picks out human
females and being a human female depends on various biological and
anatomical features (like genitalia). Historically many feminists have
understood ‘woman’ differently: not as a sex term, but as
a gender term that depends on social and cultural factors (like social
position). In so doing, they distinguished sex (being female or male)
from gender (being a woman or a man), although most ordinary language
users appear to treat the two interchangeably. More recently this
distinction has come under sustained attack and many view it nowadays
with (at least some) suspicion. This entry outlines and discusses
distinctly feminist debates on sex and gender.

philosophy, and philosophy of language and art, feminist philosophers

Feminist Perspectives on the Body,0.631599485874176,0.6762074828147888,"


In terms of the history of western philosophy, the philosophy of
embodiment is relatively recent. For much of this history the
body has been conceptualised as simply one biological object among
others, part of a biological nature, which our rational faculties set us
apart from, as well as an instrument to be directed, and a possible
source of disruption to be controlled. Problematically for feminists,
the opposition between mind and body has also been correlated with an
opposition between male and female, with the female regarded as
enmeshed in her bodily existence in a way that makes attainment of
rationality questionable. “Women are somehow more
biological, more corporeal, and more natural than
men” (Grosz 1994 14). Such enmeshment in corporeality was also
attributed to colonised bodies and those attributed to the lower
classes (McClintock 1995, Alcoff 2006, 103). Challenging such
assumptions required feminists to confront corporeality in order to
elucidate and confront constructions of sexed difference.


In developing philosophical frameworks for making sense of sexed
difference feminist philosophers have provided accounts of the
relationship between subjectivity, corporeality and identity which are
also applicable to other aspects of our corporeal existence.  Feminist
theorists are therefore currently in active conversation with critical
race theorists (Alcoff, Ahmed, Gilman, Gooding-Williams), theorists of
(dis)ability (Inahara, Garland Thompson, Thomas, Wendell), and
theorists concerned with aging, health and illness (Inahara, Mairs,
Toombs). Their concerns have also required an engagement with the
philosophy of biology, as naturalising accounts of embodiment have
been resisted, while the distinctive materiality of our embodied
situations in the world has nonetheless been respected (Birke, Bleier,
Fausto-Sterling, Grosz, Haraway, Tuana).

Feminist Perspectives on the Self,0.6232833862304688,0.6851863861083984,"


The topic of the self has long been salient in feminist philosophy,
for it is pivotal to questions about personal identity, the body,
sociality, and agency that feminism must address. Simone de Beauvoir's
provocative declaration, “He is the Subject, he is the
Absolute—she is the Other,” signals the central importance
of the self for feminism. To be the Other is to be the non-subject,
the non-person, the non-agent—in short, the mere body. In law,
in customary practice, and in cultural stereotypes, women's selfhood
has been systematically subordinated, diminished, and belittled, when
it has not been outright denied. Throughout history, women have been
identified either as pale reflections of men or as their opposite,
characterized through perceived differences from men and subordinated
as a result of them; in both cases, women have been denigrated on the
basis of these views. Since women have been cast as lesser forms of
the masculine individual, the paradigm of the self that has gained
ascendancy in U.S. popular culture and in Western philosophy is
derived from the experience of the predominantly white and
heterosexual, mostly economically advantaged men who have wielded
social, economic, and political power and who have dominated the arts,
literature, the media, and scholarship. As a result, feminists have
not merely perceived the self as a metaphysical issue but have also
drawn attention to its ethical, epistemological, social, and political
imbrication. Responding to this state of affairs, feminist
philosophical work on the self has taken three main tacks: (1)
critiques of dominant modern, Western views of the self, (2)
reclamations of female identities, and (3) reconceptualizations of the
self as both (a) a dynamic, relational individual beholden to
unconscious desires and social bonds and (b) an intersectional,
multilayered phenomenon. The feminist reconceptualizations of the self
have in turn not only challenged standard philosophical models for
their biases but also shifted the center of the discipline toward
mutlilayered models of the relational self.  This entry will survey
both critical and reconstructive feminist approaches to the self.

Feminist Perspectives on Trans Issues,0.6398606896400452,0.6875404715538025,"


The relationship between feminism and transgender theory and politics
is surprisingly fraught. The goal in this entry is to outline some of
the key philosophical issues at the intersections, and this can be
accomplished only by attending to the history of feminist and trans
politics as it has unfolded in the U.S. “Transgender” as a
politics and “trans studies” as a twin of “queer
studies” (Stryker 2004) emerged in the early 1990s and this
emergence is intertwined with feminist as well as queer theory and
politics. (These terms will be explained below.) Consequently, this
entry will follow a roughly chronological order.


One major set of philosophical themes concerns competing conceptions
of the self and its relation to the sexed body and to gender.
(Biological sex is often distinguished from gender,
taken as the cultural roles assigned on the basis of sex). Is the self
prior to the institution of gender identity? Is sex the
“hardware” on which the program of gender is run, or is sex
itself thoroughly cultural? If the self is irrevocably immersed in
cultural gender, how is resistance to gender oppression possible at
all? Moreover, how should answers to these questions inform feminist
politics and theory? How should they inform trans politics and
theory?


A related set of themes concerns the political and philosophical
difficulties in formulating a theory of gender oppression and
strategies for resistance when multiple modalities of oppression are
recognized: If trans people are oppressed as trans people and
women are oppressed as women, then it would seem we need an
account of at least two different modalities of gender oppression. Do
these two different modalities lead to politics that are inevitably at
odds with each other? And if so how could we then accommodate
individuals who are oppressed as woman and as trans people? How
is coalition among non trans feminists and trans activists possible?
Where are the grounds of commonality? Where are the tensions?

Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach,0.5915446281433105,0.861725926399231,"

For a number of years in the mid-nineteenth century Ludwig Feuerbach
(1804–1872) played an important role in the history of
post-Hegelian German philosophy, and in the transition from idealism
to various forms of naturalism, materialism and positivism that is one
of the most notable developments of this period. To the extent that he
is remembered today by non-specialists in the history of
nineteenth-century religious thought, it is mainly as the object of
Marx’s criticism in his famous Theses on Feuerbach,
originally penned in 1845 and first published posthumously by
Friedrich Engels as an appendix to his book, Ludwig Feuerbach and
the End of Classical German Philosophy (Engels 1888). Although
never without his admirers, who have included several leading
popularizers of scientific materialism in the second half the
nineteenth century (cf. Gregory 1977), not to mention the theologian,
Karl Barth, Feuerbach’s public influence declined rapidly after
the failed revolution of 1848/49 (in approximately inverse proportion
to the rising popularity of Schopenhauer). Renewed philosophical
attention paid to him in the middle of the twentieth century is
largely attributable to the publication, beginning in the late 1920s,
of Marx’s early philosophical manuscripts, including The
German Ideology, which revealed the extent of Feuerbach’s
influence on Marx and Engels during the period culminating in the
composition of that historic work (1845–46). 

Apart from this influence, and the continuing interest of his work as
a theorist of religion, Feuerbach’s importance for the history
of modern philosophy is also due to the fact that the publication of
The Essence of Christianity in 1841 can be taken, as it was
by Engels, to symbolically mark the end of the period of classical
German philosophy that had begun sixty years earlier with the
appearance of Kant’s Critique of Pure
Reason—though some might want to question the assumption
involved in this way of putting things that classical German
philosophy culminated in the Hegelian system that Engels thought of
Feuerbach as having overthrown. In any case, Feuerbach’s
biography and the trajectory of his thinking are both closely
intertwined with political and intellectual developments in the period
referred to by historians as the Vormärz, which extends
from
 1830–1848.[1]
 Although he remained unable to bring to fruition the
“philosophy of the future”, the aphoristically formulated
“principles” of which he attempted to set out in 1843, the
emphases in his later essays on corporeality, the senses, finitude,
inter-subjectivity, and drive psychology introduced into the history

Fiction,0.7947214841842651,0.5794388651847839,"


Philosophical issues surrounding fiction have attracted increasing attention
from philosophers over the past few decades. What follows is a discussion of
one familiar and quite fundamental topic in this area: fictional entities
(both the issue of what such entities might be like and whether there  really
are such entities). The discussion will form the second part of a projected
two-part entry on Fiction, with the first part to cover such topics as the
nature of fiction, the notion of truth in fiction, and the character of our
emotional responses to fiction.


A familiar characteristic of works of fiction is that they feature
fictional characters: individuals whose exploits are written about in
works of fiction and who make their first appearance in a work of
fiction. Shakespeare's Hamlet, for example, features the
fictional character Hamlet, Doyle's The Hound of the
Baskervilles features Sherlock Holmes, Tolstoy's Anna
Karenina features Anna Karenina, and so on. All of these works
feature numerous other fictional characters, of course (Ophelia and Dr
Watson, for example); indeed, some works of fiction are characterized
by the sheer abundance of their characters (Russian novels are often
said to have this characteristic). Fictional characters belong to the
class of entities variously known as fictional entities
or fictional objects or ficta, a class that includes
not just animate objects of fiction (fictional persons, animals,
monsters, and so on) but also inanimate objects of fiction such as
fictional places (Anthony Trollope's cathedral town of Barchester and
Tolkien's home of the elves, Rivendell, for example). As stated,
however, it doesn't include entities located in the real world,
although real entities do have an important role to play in works of
fiction. Thus, neither London nor Napoleon are fictional entities,
although the first is the quite essential backdrop to what goes on in
the Holmes stories while the second plays an important role in the
events described in War and Peace. (While London and Napoleon
are not fictional entities, some have thought that the London of the
Holmes stories and the Napoleon of War and Peace are
fictional entities.)


The above characterization suggests that fictional entities
constitute a special type of entity. Not surprisingly, then, one
fundamental philosophical question we can ask about fictional entities
is a question about their nature: what kind of thing is a fictional
entity? This question is separate from what seems an even more
fundamental question: why suppose that there are any fictional entities
in the first place? After all, our world never contained a Sherlock
Holmes or a Rivendell—these alleged entities make their
appearance in works of fiction, not works of fact. Following the
division in Thomasson (1999), we shall call the first question the
metaphysical question, and the second
the ontological question.

characterized as the view that claims made within that discourse are
not best seen as aiming at literal truth but are better regarded as a
sort of ‘fiction’. As we will see, this first
characterization of fictionalism is in several ways rough. But it is a
useful point of departure.


This entry is divided into five main sections. The first section
contains a brief history and overview of fictionalist views. The second section
describes more carefully what different fictionalist theses there
are. In the third and fourth sections, important arguments for and
against fictionalism are summarized. The fifth section is
devoted to a more general discussion of the philosophical significance
of fictionalism.

Fictionalism in the Philosophy of Mathematics,0.8250125050544739,0.599756121635437,"

Mathematical fictionalism (hereafter, simply fictionalism) is
best thought of as a reaction to mathematical platonism. Platonism is
the view that (a) there exist abstract mathematical objects (i.e.,
nonspatiotemporal mathematical objects), and (b) our mathematical
sentences and theories provide true descriptions of such objects. So,
for instance, on the platonist view, the sentence ‘3 is
prime’ provides a straightforward description of a certain
object—namely, the number 3—in much the same way that the
sentence ‘Mars is red’ provides a description of Mars. But
whereas Mars is a physical object, the number 3 is (according to
platonism) an abstract object. And abstract objects,
platonists tell us, are wholly nonphysical, nonmental, nonspatial,
nontemporal, and noncausal. Thus, on this view, the number 3 exists
independently of us and our thinking, but it does not exist in space
or time, it is not a physical or mental object, and it does not enter
into causal relations with other objects. This view has been endorsed
by Plato, Frege (1884, 1893–1903, 1919), Gödel (1964), and
in some of their writings, Russell (1912) and Quine (1948, 1951), not
to mention numerous more recent philosophers of mathematics, e.g.,
Putnam (1971), Parsons (1971), Steiner (1975), Resnik (1997), Shapiro
(1997), Hale (1987), Wright (1983), Katz (1998), Zalta (1988), Colyvan
(2001), McEvoy (2012), and Marcus (2015).

Fictionalism, on the other hand, is the view that (a) our mathematical
sentences and theories do purport to be about abstract mathematical
objects, as platonism suggests, but (b) there are no such things as
abstract objects, and so (c) our mathematical theories are not true.
Thus, the idea is that sentences like ‘3 is prime’ are
false, or untrue, for the same reason that, say, ‘The tooth
fairy is generous’ is false or untrue—because just as
there is no such person as the tooth fairy, so too there is no such
thing as the number 3. It is important to note, however, that despite
the name, fictionalist views do not have to involve any very strong
claims about the analogy between mathematics and fiction. For
instance, there is no claim here that mathematical discourse is a kind
of fictional discourse. Thus, fictionalists are not committed to the
thesis that there are no important disanalogies between mathematics
and fiction. (We will return to this issue below, in section 2.4.)
Finally, it should also be noted at the start that fictionalism is a
version of mathematical nominalism, the view that there are
no such things as mathematical objects.

Fictionalism was first introduced by Field (1980, 1989, 1998, 2016).
Since then, the view has been developed—in a few different
ways—by Balaguer (1996a, 1998a, 2001, 2009), Rosen (2001), Yablo
(2002a, 2002b, 2005), Leng (2005a, 2005b, 2010), and Bueno (2009),
though as will become clear below, one might question whether Bueno
and Yablo are best interpreted as fictionalists. Others to endorse or
defend fictionalism (or views in the neighborhood of fictionalism)
include Daly (2006), Liggins (2010), Contessa (2016), and Plebani
(2018). Finally, one might also interpret Melia (2000) as defending a
fictionalist view, though he doesn’t really commit to this.

It’s worth noting that Hoffman (2004) also endorses a view that
is a kind of fictionalism. Her view is very different from the
fictionalist view defined above, however, because it doesn’t
involve a commitment to thesis (a). She reinterprets mathematics along
the lines of Kitcher (1984) and then endorses a fictionalist view of
this reinterpretation; i.e., she maintains that once mathematics is
reinterpreted in this way, it’s singular terms fail to refer and
its sentences are not true. (It’s not clear how much this view
differs from Kitcher’s view; one might interpret Kitcher as
endorsing a very similar view.) In any event, it is important to note
that Hoffman’s rejection of thesis (a) makes her view radically
different from more standard fictionalist views. As will become clear
below, thesis (a) is very plausible, and its plausibility is one of
the main reasons for the popularity of platonism. Thus, one of the
main selling points of fictionalism—i.e., the standard sort of
fictionalism defined above—is that it combines an acceptance of
thesis (a) with an anti-platonistic ontology.

It’s also worth noting that Lear (1982) and Corkum (2012) argue
that Aristotle held a version of mathematical fictionalism; but as
Corkum notes, it’s unlikely that Aristotle held the version of
fictionalism defined above. 

When one first hears the fictionalist hypothesis, it can seem a bit
crazy. Are we really supposed to believe that sentences like ‘3
is prime’ and ‘2 + 2 = 4’ are false? But
the appeal of fictionalism starts to emerge when we realize what the
alternatives are. By thinking carefully about the issues surrounding
the interpretation of mathematical discourse, it can start to seem
that fictionalism is actually very plausible, and indeed, that it
might just be the least crazy view out there.

Section 1 provides a formulation of what might be thought of as the
central argument for fictionalism. Section 2 provides a discussion of
a number of different objections to fictionalism, as well as a number
of different versions of fictionalism. These two things go
together very naturally, because the different versions of
fictionalism have emerged in connection with the responses that
different philosophers have given to the various objections to
fictionalism.

Modal Fictionalism,0.8164111375808716,0.6045461297035217,"


Questions about necessity (or what has to be, or what cannot be 
otherwise) and possibility (or what can be, or what could be 
otherwise) are questions about modality. 
Fictionalism is an approach to theoretical matters in a 
given area which treats the claims in that area as being in some 
sense analogous to fictional claims: claims we do not literally 
accept at face value, but which we nevertheless think serve some 
useful function. However, despite its name, “Modal 
Fictionalism” in its usual manifestations is not primarily 
fictionalism about claims of necessity and possibility, but rather a 
fictionalist approach to claims about possible worlds. (For instance,
modal fictionalism is not normally fictionalist about the claim that 
“it is possible that there be a species of tail-less 
kangaroo”, but rather about the claim that “there is a 
possible world in which there is a species of tail-less 
kangaroo”.) The practice of taking possible worlds to be merely
convenient fictions, or of treating talk about possible worlds as 
being useful without being literally correct, is quite common in 
philosophical circles. It is only recently, however, that 
philosophers have seriously examined the implications of taking 
possible worlds to be merely fictional objects, like Sherlock Holmes 
or a frictionless surface. 


Theories employing possible worlds terminology have been found to be 
very useful in philosophy, e.g. when engaging in thought experiments;
distinguishing various claims in metaphysics, or in the philosophy of
language, mind, knowledge or ethics; and in areas other than 
philosophy, like linguistics, modal logic, and probability theory. 
Many have found the status of these worlds and their contents to be 
puzzling, to say the least. What are they? Where, if anywhere, are 
they supposed to be? How are we supposed to discover facts about 
them? Isn't it extravagant to believe that just because a situation 
is possible, it must in some sense exist? Modal fictionalists take 
theories committed to the existence of possible worlds, merely 
hypothetical situations, non-actual but possible objects etc. to be 
strictly and literally false, and so they avoid the problems of 
believing in possible worlds. Nevertheless, they claim, they can 
enjoy the benefits of using these seemingly problematic theories.


Modal fictionalism should be of interest to those concerned with the 
metaphysics of modality, since theories committed to the literal 
existence of possible worlds (and, even more worryingly, the literal 
existence of merely possible objects ‘contained’ in these
worlds) come at a cost, both to economy and to many people's 
intuitions. But it is, or should be, of wider interest as well, since
it is one of the most discussed applications of a fictionalist 
treatment of abstract objects, along with mathematical fictionalism. 
Lessons learned in the case of modal fictionalism can hopefully be 
applied to other areas in which we may wish to evade literal 
theoretical commitments.


I shall begin by discussing the motivation for modal fictionalism, 
and distinguishing some of its varieties. Next, I shall seek to put 
fictionalism in a slightly broader theoretical context, by discussing
its connections with instrumentalism and eliminativism, and by 
discussing what connection there might be between 
“fictionalism” and treatments of paradigmatic fictions. I
shall then discuss the debate about the “Brock/Rosen 
objection” and a problem raised by Bob Hale, both of which turn
on technical problems concerning modal claims about the status of the
modal fiction. Finally, in section 4, other concerns about modal 
fictionalism will be discussed.

Fideism,0.6954357028007507,0.7964563369750977,"

“What indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem?” (246) This
question of the relation between reason—here represented by
Athens—and faith—represented by Jerusalem—was posed
by the church father Tertullian (c.160–230 CE), and it remains a
central preoccupation among contemporary philosophers of religion.

“Fideism” is the name given to that school of
thought—to which Tertullian himself is frequently said to have
subscribed—which answers that faith is in some sense independent
of, if not outright adversarial toward, reason. In contrast to the
more rationalistic tradition of natural theology, with its arguments
for the existence of God, fideism holds—or at any rate
appears to hold (more on this caveat shortly)—that
reason is unnecessary and inappropriate for the exercise and
justification of religious belief. The term itself derives from
fides, the Latin word for faith, and can be rendered
literally as faith-ism. “Fideism” is thus to be
understood not as a synonym for “religious belief,” but as
denoting a particular philosophical account of faith’s appropriate
jurisdiction vis-a-vis that of reason.

Philosophy of Film,0.8549620509147644,0.4268366694450377,"


The philosophy of film is now a firmly established subfield of
contemporary philosophy of art. Although philosophers were among the
first academics to publish studies of the new artform in the early
decades of the twentieth century, the field did not experience
significant growth until the 1980's when a renaissance occurred. There
are many reasons for the field's recent growth. Suffice it to say here
that changes in both academic philosophy and the cultural role of the
movies in general made it imperative for philosophers to take film
seriously as an artform on a par with the more traditional ones like
theater, dance, and painting. As a result of this surge in interest in
film as a subject for philosophical reflection, the philosophy of film
has become an important area of research in aesthetics.


This entry is organized around a number of issues that are central to
the philosophy of film. They explore different aspect of film as an
artistic medium, illustrating the range of concerns addressed within
the philosophy of film.

Fine-Tuning,0.9117951989173888,0.4202136397361755,"

The term “fine-tuning” is used to characterize
sensitive dependences of facts or properties on the values of certain
parameters. Technological devices are paradigmatic examples of
fine-tuning. Whether they function as intended depends sensitively on
parameters that describe the shape, arrangement, and material
properties of their constituents, e.g., the constituents’
conductivity, elasticity and thermal expansion coefficient.
Technological devices are the products of actual
“fine-tuners”—engineers and manufacturers who
designed and built them—but for fine-tuning in the broad sense
of this article to obtain, sensitivity with respect to the values of
certain parameters is sufficient.

Philosophical debates in which “fine-tuning” appears are
often about the universe’s fine-tuning for life:
according to many physicists, the fact that the universe is able to
support life depends delicately on various of its fundamental
characteristics, notably on the form of the laws of nature, on the
values of some constants of nature, and on aspects of the
universe’s conditions in its very early stages. Various
reactions to the universe’s fine-tuning for life have been
proposed: that it is a lucky coincidence which we have to accept as a
primitive given; that it will be avoided by future best theories of
fundamental physics; that the universe was created by some divine
designer who established life-friendly conditions; and that
fine-tuning for life indicates the existence of multiple other
universes with conditions very different from those in our own
universe. Sections 1–4 of the present article review the case
for this fine-tuning for life, the reactions to it, and major
criticisms of these reactions. Section 5 turns from fine-tuning for
life to the criterion of naturalness—a condition of no
fine-tuning in a rather different sense which applies to theories in
quantum field theory and plays a large role in contemporary particle
physics and cosmology.

Fitch's Paradox of Knowability,0.8404068350791931,0.7547129988670349,"

The paradox of knowability is a logical result suggesting that,
necessarily, if all truths are knowable in principle then all truths
are in fact known.  The contrapositive of the result says,
necessarily, if in fact there is an unknown truth, then there is a
truth that couldn't possibly be known. More specifically,
if p is a truth that is never known then it is unknowable
that p is a truth that is never known. The proof has been
used to argue against versions of anti-realism committed to the thesis
that all truths are knowable.  For clearly there are unknown truths;
individually and collectively we are non-omniscient. So, by the main
result, it is false that all truths are knowable.  The result has also
been used to draw more general lessons about the limits of human
knowledge. Still others have taken the proof to be fallacious, since
it collapses an apparently moderate brand of anti-realism into an
obviously implausible and naive idealism.

Fitness,0.99740332365036,0.5719935894012451,"
 

The diversity, complexity, and adaptation of the biological realm
is evident. Until Darwin, the best explanation for these three
features of the biological was the conclusion of the “argument
from design.” Darwin’s theory of natural selection
provides an explanation of all three of these features of the
biological realm without adverting to some mysterious designing
entity, by explaining the process of “the survival of the
fittest.” But this explanation’s success turns on the
meaning of its central explanatory concept,
‘fitness’. Moreover, since Darwinian theory provides the
resources for a purely causal account of teleology, wherever it is
manifested, its reliance on the concept of ‘fitness’ makes
it imperative that conceptual problems threatening the explanatory
legitimacy of this notion be solved.

Fitting Attitude Theories of Value,0.6134880781173706,0.8316528797149658,"


Fitting attitude (FA) theories propose to analyze value, or some
limited range of values, in terms of evaluative attitudes endorsed as
fitting—or, alternatively, as appropriate, correct,
merited, proper, rational, or warranted. (FA theories come in both
cognitivist and noncognitivist versions, and can be given either a
realist or a quasi-realist gloss. For discussion of this point, see
(D'Arms and Jacobson 2006a)). Contrast this view with its two
main realist alternatives, robust realism and dispositionalism.
According to robust realism, values exist independently of human
responses to them, like such primary qualities as shape and size. A
yellow tennis ball looks spherical because it is (roughly) a sphere;
and shapes can be defined without recourse to anything about our
responses to them. By contrast, colors depend, in some way, both on the
qualities of things and on our perceptual capacities. Even if yellow is
defined in terms of certain physical properties of yellow objects, the
reason we conceive of colors as we do—which makes yellow a useful
concept to us—is because of the way our color vision happens to
work. According to a simple dispositionalist view of color, yellowness
just is whatever has the power to arouse yellow appearances to normal
human observers in standard conditions. Similarly, a dispositionalist
view of value understands funniness, for instance, in terms of whatever
amuses normal humans in standard conditions; whereas robust realism
about the comic holds that amusement, when correct, is a perception of
some mind-independent quality of funniness.


An FA theory of humor agrees with dispositionalism that the funny
can only be characterized in terms of a human response (amusement); but
it also holds, with robust realism, that the amusement of even normal
humans in standard conditions can be mistaken: it can be unfitting. To
call something funny is in some way to endorse amusement at
it, not to report or predict it. The attraction of FA theory is that it
purports to capture the sense that we ought to be amused at certain
things because they are funny, as robust realism has it, while agreeing
with dispositionalism that funny cannot be understood except by way of
human response and sensibility: our sense of humor.


Although terms such as ‘fitting’,
‘appropriate’, and the like are often used interchangeably,
there are several distinct forms of endorsement one can give to
evaluative attitudes (such as emotions and desires), and the failure to
differentiate adequately between them gives rise to the central
outstanding problem facing FA theory: the wrong kind of reason
problem. Consider the simplest form of FA theory, which analyzes
goodness in terms of what it is fitting to desire: the desirable. Not
all considerations in favor of desiring something manifest its
desirability; for instance, incentives and sanctions attached to desire
do not. Perhaps desiring certain good things (such as happiness) makes
one less likely to succeed in getting them. If so, then that seems a
good reason not to desire happiness, but it clearly does not show that
happiness isn't desirable. Thus FA theories must explicate a
notion of fittingness that can distinguish reasons of the right kind:
those relevant to evaluative judgment of the object. Moreover, the
evaluative attitudes used by the theory must not already involve the
value concept it attempts to explicate, on pain of circularity. If to
desire something involves thinking it good, for example, then an FA
theory of goodness in terms of fitting desire seems circular. However,
certain FA accounts claim, at least with respect to more fine-grained
attitudes and specific values, that such circularity is not vicious
because it does real explanatory work.


The class of FA theories includes some quite disparate views, which
differ importantly in their fundamental motivation as well as in their
scope and ambition. Although the renewed interest in FA theories arose
from a dispute between quasi-realist expressivism (Blackburn 1993,
Gibbard 1990) and anthropocentric, less-than-robust realism (McDowell
1998, Wiggins 1987), the metaethical differences between these two
approaches seem less significant than their similarities (D'Arms
and Jacobson 2006a). Rather, the most significant differences among FA
theories concern the range of values they seek to analyze, the specific
evaluative attitudes they adduce to do so, and whether or not they give
explanatory priority to those evaluative attitudes. Three distinct
varieties of FA theory are generic attitude theories,
which aspire to give a general and non-circular theory of value in
terms of some capacious notion such as desire or approval;
sentimentalist theories that focus specifically on the
sentiments and those values most intimately related to them, such as
shame and the shameful; and sensibility theories, which deny
the priority of evaluative attitudes in favor of an overtly circular
account of value properties and evaluative responses.

In the 1930s, Ludwik Fleck (1896–1961), a Polish-Jewish
microbiologist, developed the first system of the historical
philosophy and sociology of science. Fleck claimed that cognition is a
collective activity, since it is only possible on the basis of a
certain body of knowledge acquired from other people. When people
begin to exchange ideas, a thought collective arises, bonded
by a specific mood, and as a result of a series of
understandings and misunderstandings a peculiar thought style
is developed. When a thought style becomes sufficiently sophisticated,
the collective divides itself into an esoteric circle
(professionals) and an exoteric circle (laymen). A thought
style consists of the active elements, which shape ways in
which members of the collective see and think about the world, and of
the passive elements, the sum of which is perceived as an
“objective reality”.  What we call “facts”,
are social constructs: only what is true to culture is true to
nature. Thought styles are often incommensurable: what is a
fact to the members of a thought collective A sometimes does not exist
to the members of a thought collective B, and a thought that is
significant and true to the members of A may sometimes be false or
meaningless for members of B.

Folk Psychology as Mental Simulation,0.8055064082145691,0.3822315335273743,"

The capacity for “mindreading” is understood in philosophy
of mind and cognitive science as the capacity to represent, reason
about, and respond to others’ mental states. Essentially the
same capacity is also known as “folk psychology”,
“Theory of Mind”, and “mentalizing”. An
example of everyday mindreading: you notice that Tom’s
fright embarrassed Mary and surprised Bill,
who had believed that Tom wanted to try
everything. Mindreading is of crucial importance for our social life:
our ability to predict, explain, and/or coordinate with others’
actions on countless occasions crucially relies on representing their
mental states. For instance, by attributing to Steve the desire for a
banana and the belief that there are no more bananas at home but there
are some left at the local grocery store, you can: (i)
explain why Steve has just left home; (ii) predict
where Steve is heading; and (iii) coordinate your behavior
with his (meet him at the store, or prepare a surpise party while he
is gone). Without mindreading, (i)–(iii) do not come
easily—if they come at all. That much is fairly uncontroversial.
What is controversial is how to explain mindreading. That is, how do
people arrive at representing others’ mental states? This is the
main question to which the Simulation (or, mental simulation) Theory
(ST) of mindreading offers an answer.

Common sense has it that, in many circumstances, we arrive at
representing others’ mental states by putting ourselves in their
shoes, or taking their perspective. For example, I can try to figure
out my chess opponent’s next decision by imagining what I would
decide if I were in her place. (Although we may also speak of this as
a kind of empathy, that term must be understood here without
any implication of sympathy or benevolence.)

ST takes this commonsensical idea seriously and develops it into a
fully-fledged theory. At the core of the theory, we find the thesis
that mental simulation plays a central role in mindreading:
we typically arrive at representing others’ mental states by
simulating their mental states in our own mind. So, to figure out my
chess opponent’s next decision, I mentally switch roles with her
in the game. In doing this, I simulate her relevant beliefs
and goals, and then feed these simulated mental states into
my decision-making mechanism and let the mechanism produce a simulated
decision. This decision is projected on or attributed to the
opponent. In other words, the basic idea of ST is that if the
resources our own brain uses to guide our own behavior can be modified
to work as representations of other people’s mental states, then
we have no need to store general information about what makes people
tick: we just do the ticking for them. Accordingly, ST challenges the
Theory-Theory of mindreading (TT), the view that a tacit psychological
theory underlies the ability to represent and reason about
others’ mental states. While TT maintains that mindreading is an
information-rich and theory-driven process, ST sees it as
informationally poor and process driven (Goldman 1989).

This entry is organized as follows. In section 1 (The Origins and
Varieties of ST), we briefly reconstruct ST’s history and
elaborate further on ST’s main theoretical aims. We then go on
to explain the very idea of mental simulation (section 2: What is
Meant by “Mental Simulation”?) In section 3 (Two Types of
Simulation Processes), we consider the cognitive architecture
underlying mental simulation and introduce the distinction between
high-level and low-level simulation processes. In section 4 (The Role
of Mental Simulation in Mindreading), we discuss what role mental
simulation is supposed to play in mindreading, according to ST. This
discussion carries over to section 5 (Simulation Theory and
Theory-Theory), where we contrast the accounts of mindreading given by
ST and TT. Finally, section 6 (Simulation Theory: Pros and Cons)
examines some of the main arguments in favour of and against ST as
theory of mindreading.

Folk Psychology as a Theory,0.8020363450050354,0.4029843211174011,"

The concept of folk psychology has played a significant role in
philosophy of mind and cognitive science over the last half century.
However, even a cursory examination of the literature reveals that
there are at least three distinct senses in which the term “folk
psychology” is used. (1) Sometimes “folk psychology”
is used to refer to a particular set of cognitive capacities which
include—but are not exhausted by—the capacities to predict
and explain behavior. (2) The term “folk psychology” is
also used to refer to a theory of behavior represented in the brain.
According to many philosophers and cognitive scientists, the set of
cognitive capacities identified above are underpinned by folk
psychology in this second sense. (3) The final sense of “folk
psychology” is closely associated with the work of David Lewis.
On this view, folk psychology is a psychological theory constituted by
the platitudes about the mind ordinary people are inclined to
endorse.

To reduce terminological ambiguity, throughout this entry the term
“mindreading” will be used to refer to that set of
cognitive capacities which include (but is not exhausted by) the
capacities to predict and explain behavior. “Folk
psychology” will be used only in the second and third senses
identified above. When separate names are required to avoid confusion,
the second sense of “folk psychology” will be called the
mindreading approach to folk psychology and the third sense
the platitude approach to folk psychology. This terminology
is due to Stich & Nichols 2003.

It’s not clear who introduced the term “folk
psychology” into the philosophy of mind. It gained wide usage
during the 1980s and is rarely used outside philosophy. The phrase
“commonsense psychology” is sometimes used by philosophers
synonymously with “folk psychology”, although the former
term seems to be dying out. Psychologists rarely use “folk
psychology”, preferring the phrase “theory of mind”
(or sometimes “naïve psychology”). Just as there is
ambiguity in the use of “folk psychology”, “theory
of mind” is used to refer both to mindreading and to the theory
hypothesized to underpin mindreading.

Philippa Foot produced a slim output of articles, most of which are
collected in two volumes, and one monograph on moral philosophy; the
articles treated issues in metaethics, moral psychology, and applied
ethics. Throughout her career, she defended the objectivity of
morality against various forms of noncognitivism and tangled with
issues of moral motivation, notoriously changing her mind about
whether moral judgments necessarily provide rational agents with
reasons for action. To the wider world, and perhaps especially to

Forgiveness,0.3695577383041382,0.682224452495575,"

To forgive is to respond in a particular way to someone who has
treated someone badly or wrongly. Forgiveness is therefore a dyadic
relation involving a wrongdoer and a wronged party, and is thought to
be a way in which victims of wrongdoing alter both their and a
wrongdoer’s status by, for instance, acknowledging yet moving
past a moral transgression. Commonly, forgiveness is thought to
involve the giving up of certain negative emotions towards the
wrongdoer, the forbearance of negative reactions against the
wrongdoer, and possibly the restoration of the relationship with the
wrongdoer. Much philosophical discussion of forgiveness centers on
three primary questions: (1) What is the nature of
forgiveness—what must one do in order to forgive; (2) Who has
standing to forgive—when is one in a position to forgive a
wrongdoer; and (3) What are the norms governing forgiveness—when
is forgiveness morally good, right, or praiseworthy?

Formalism in the Philosophy of Mathematics,0.8803800344467163,0.6577298641204834,"

The guiding idea behind formalism is that mathematics is not a body
of propositions representing an abstract sector of reality but is much
more akin to a game, bringing with it no more commitment to an ontology
of objects or properties than ludo or chess. This idea has some
intuitive plausibility: consider the tyro toiling at multiplication
tables or the student using a standard algorithm for differentiating or
integrating a function. It also corresponds to some aspects of the
practice of advanced mathematicians in some periods—for example, the
treatment of imaginary numbers for some time after Bombelli's
introduction of them, and perhaps the attitude of some contemporary
mathematicians towards the higher flights of set theory. Finally, it is
often the position to which philosophically naïve respondents will
gesture towards, when pestered by questions as to the nature of
mathematics.

Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology,0.5491206049919128,0.2826984226703644,"


Students of Plato and other ancient philosophers divide philosophy
into three parts: Ethics, Epistemology and Metaphysics. While generally
accurate and certainly useful for pedagogical purposes, no rigid
boundary separates the parts. Ethics, for example, concerns how one
ought to live and focuses on pleasure, virtue, and happiness. Since,
according to Plato (and Socrates), virtue and happiness require
knowledge, e.g., knowledge of goods and evils, Plato's ethics is
inseparable from his epistemology. Epistemology is, broadly speaking,
the study of what knowledge is and how one comes to have knowledge.
Among the many topics included in epistemology are logic, belief,
perception, language, science, and knowledge. (‘Science’
derives from the Latin ‘scientia’, which in turn
translates the Greek ‘episteme’, from which
English derives ‘epistemology’.) Integral to all of these
notions is that they (typically) are directed at something. Words refer
to something; perception (aesthesis in Greek) involves
perceptibles; knowledge requires a known. In this respect, epistemology
cannot be investigated without regard to what there is.


Metaphysics, or alternatively ontology, is that branch of philosophy
whose special concern is to answer the question ‘What is
there?’ These expressions derive from Aristotle, Plato's student.
In a collection of his works, the most detailed treatise on the general
topic of things that are comes after a treatise on natural things,
ta phusika (from which English derives
‘physics’). Since the Greek for ‘after’ is
meta, this treatise is titled ‘Metaphysics’. In
that work one finds the famous formula that (first) philosophy studies
being—the Greek for which is on—qua being. Hence the
account of being is ‘ontology’—the English suffix
‘-ology’ signifying ‘study of’: e.g., biology
is the study of living things.


Metaphysics, then, studies the ways in which anything that
is can be said or thought to be. Leaving to sciences like biology or
physics or mathematics or psychology the task of addressing the special
ways in which physical things, or living things, or mathematical
objects, e.g., numbers, or souls (minds) come to have the peculiar
qualities each, respectively, has, the subject-matter of metaphysics
are principles common to everything. Perhaps the most general principle
is: to be is to be something. Nothing just exists, we might say. This
notion implies that each entity/item/thing has at least some one
feature or quality or property. Keeping at a general level, we can
provisionally distinguish three factors involved when anything is
whatever it is: there is that which bears or has the property, often
called the ‘subject’, e.g., Socrates, the number three, or
my soul; there is the property which is possessed; e.g., being thin,
being odd, and being immortal; and there is the manner or way in which
the property is tied or connected to the subject. For instance, while
Socrates may be accidentally thin, since he can change, that is, gain
and lose weight, three cannot fail to be odd nor, if Plato is correct,
can the soul fail to be immortal. The metaphysician, then, considers
physical or material things as well as immaterial items such as souls,
god and numbers in order to study notions like property, subject,
change, being essentially or accidentally.

Form vs. Matter,0.6570994257926941,0.17027844488620758,"

Aristotle famously contends that every physical object is a compound
of matter and form. This doctrine has been dubbed
“hylomorphism”, a portmanteau of the Greek words for
matter (hulê) and form (eidos or
morphê). Highly influential in the development of
Medieval philosophy, Aristotle’s hylomorphism has also enjoyed
something of a renaissance in contemporary metaphysics.

While the basic idea of hylomorphism is easy to grasp, much remains
unclear beneath the surface. Aristotle introduces matter and form, in
the Physics, to account for changes in the natural world,
where he is particularly interested in explaining how substances come
into existence even though, as he maintains, there is no generation
ex nihilo, that is that nothing comes from nothing. In this
connection, he develops a general hylomorphic framework, which he then
extends by putting it to work in a variety of contexts. For example,
he deploys it in his Metaphysics, where he argues that form
is what unifies some matter into a single object, the compound of the
two; he appeals to it in his De Anima, by treating soul and
body as a special case of form and matter and by analyzing perception
as the reception of form without matter; and he suggests in the
Politics that a constitution is the form of a polis
and the citizens its matter, partly on the grounds that the
constitution serves to unify the body politic.

Hylomorphism thus finds a range of applications across
Aristotle’s corpus. This entry focuses on its genesis and
development in the Physics and Metaphysics, in order
to characterize and assess its fundamental features and core
commitments. There is in any case already a considerable controversy
at this basic level about what Aristotle means by matter and form:
what precisely they are, how they are related to one another, how
Aristotle intends to marshal arguments in support of them, and how
best to deal with reasonable objections to their metaphysical
consequences. We will begin by examining how Aristotle introduces his
twin notions. Then we will move on to discuss some of the most
important interpretative controversies: does Aristotle believe in
so-called “prime” matter? Does matter or form serve as the
principle of individuation in his metaphysics? Do natural forms
include a specification of the kind of matter that anything of that
form has to have?

Positive and Negative Liberty,0.4298321604728699,0.5993237495422363,"

Negative liberty is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints.
One has negative liberty to the extent that actions are available to
one in this negative sense. Positive liberty is the possibility of
acting — or the fact of acting — in such a way as to take
control of one's life and realize one's fundamental purposes. While
negative liberty is usually attributed to individual agents, positive
liberty is sometimes attributed to collectivities, or to individuals
considered primarily as members of given collectivities.

The idea of distinguishing between a negative and a positive sense of
the term ‘liberty’ goes back at least to Kant, and was
examined and defended in depth by Isaiah Berlin in the 1950s and
’60s. Discussions about positive and negative liberty normally
take place within the context of political and social philosophy. They
are distinct from, though sometimes related to, philosophical
discussions about
 free will.
 Work on the nature of positive liberty often overlaps, however, with
work on the nature of
 autonomy.

As Berlin showed, negative and positive liberty are not merely two
distinct kinds of liberty; they can be seen as rival, incompatible
interpretations of a single political ideal. Since few people claim to
be against liberty, the way this term is interpreted and defined can
have important political implications. Political
 liberalism
 tends to presuppose a negative definition of liberty: liberals
generally claim that if one favors individual liberty one should place
strong limitations on the activities of the state. Critics of
liberalism often contest this implication by contesting the negative
definition of liberty: they argue that the pursuit of liberty
understood as self-realization or as self-determination (whether of
the individual or of the collectivity) can require state intervention
of a kind not normally allowed by liberals.

Many authors prefer to talk of positive and negative freedom.
This is only a difference of style, and the terms
‘liberty’ and ‘freedom’ are normally used
interchangeably by political and social philosophers. Although some
attempts have been made to distinguish between liberty and freedom
(Pitkin 1988; Williams 2001; Dworkin 2011), generally speaking these
have not caught on. Neither can they be translated into other European
languages, which contain only the one term, of either Latin or
Germanic origin (e.g. liberté, Freiheit), where English
contains both.

The Free Rider Problem,0.6651753187179565,0.9226245880126952,"


In many contexts, all of the individual members of a group can
benefit from the efforts of each member and all can benefit
substantially from collective action. For example, if each of us
pollutes less by paying a bit extra for our cars, we all benefit from
the reduction of harmful gases in the air we breathe and even in the
reduced harm to the ozone layer that protects us against exposure to
carcinogenic ultraviolet radiation (although those with fair skin
benefit far more from the latter than do those with dark skin). If all
of us or some subgroup of us prefer the state of affairs in which we
each pay this bit over the state of affairs in which we do not, then
the provision of cleaner air is a collective good for us. (If it costs
more than it is worth to us, then its provision is not a collective
good for us.)


Unfortunately, my polluting less does not matter enough for anyone—especially me—to notice. Therefore, I may not contribute my
share toward not fouling the atmosphere. I may be a free
rider (or freerider) on the beneficial actions of
others. This is a compelling instance of the
logic of collective action, an instance of such grave import
that we pass laws to regulate the behavior of individuals to force them
to pollute less.

Free Will,0.5790828466415405,0.7723017334938049,"


The term “free will” has emerged over the past two
millennia as the canonical designator for a significant kind of
control over one’s actions. Questions concerning the
nature and existence of this kind of control (e.g., does it require
and do we have the freedom to do otherwise or the power of
self-determination?), and what its true significance is (is it
necessary for moral responsibility or human dignity?) have been taken
up in every period of Western philosophy and by many of the most
important philosophical figures, such as Plato, Aristotle, Augustine,
Aquinas, Descartes, and Kant. (We cannot undertake here a review of
related discussions in other philosophical traditions. For a start,
the reader may consult Marchal and Wenzel 2017 and Chakrabarti 2017
for overviews of thought on free will, broadly construed, in Chinese
and Indian philosophical traditions, respectively.) In this way, it
should be clear that disputes about free will ineluctably involve
disputes about metaphysics and ethics. In ferreting out the kind of
control involved in free will, we are forced to consider questions
about (among others) causation, laws of nature, time, substance,
ontological reduction vs emergence, the relationship of causal and
reasons-based explanations, the nature of motivation and more
generally of human persons. In assessing the significance of free
will, we are forced to consider questions about (among others)
rightness and wrongness, good and evil, virtue and vice, blame and
praise, reward and punishment, and desert. The topic of free will also
gives rise to purely empirical questions that are beginning to be
explored in the human sciences: do we have it, and to what degree?


Here is an overview of what follows. In Section 1, we
acquaint the reader with some central historical contributions to our
understanding of free will. (As nearly every major and minor figure
had something to say about it, we cannot begin to cover them all.) As
with contributions to many other foundational topics, these ideas are
not of ‘merely historical interest’: present-day
philosophers continue to find themselves drawn back to certain
thinkers as they freshly engage their contemporaries. In Section
2, we map the complex architecture of the contemporary discussion
of the nature of free will by dividing it into five subtopics: its
relation to moral responsibility; the proper analysis of the freedom
to do otherwise; a powerful, recent argument that the freedom to do
otherwise (at least in one important sense) is not necessary
for moral responsibility; ‘compatibilist’ accounts of
sourcehood or self-determination; and ‘incompatibilist’ or
‘libertarian’ accounts of source and
self-determination. In Section 3, we consider arguments from
experience, a priori reflection, and various scientific findings and
theories for and against the thesis that human beings have free will,
along with the related question of whether it is reasonable to believe
that we have it. Finally, in Section 4, we survey the
long-debated questions involving free will that arise in classical
theistic metaphysics.

Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will,0.5763141512870789,0.7861536145210266,"

To have free will is to have what it takes to act freely. When an
agent acts freely—when she exercises free will—it is up to
her whether she does one thing or another on that occasion. A
plurality of alternatives is open to her, and she determines which she
pursues. When she does, she is an ultimate source or origin of her
action. So runs a familiar conception of free will.

Incompatibilists hold that we act freely in this sense only if
determinism is false. Some say little more about what, besides
indeterminism, free will requires. And, indeed, the task of providing
an incompatibilist account is not an easy one. If the truth of
determinism would preclude free will, it is far from obvious how
indeterminism would help.

The incompatibilist theories that have been offered fall into three
main groups, depending on which type of indeterminism (uncaused
events, nondeterministically caused events, agent- [or substance-]
caused events) they require. Further variations among accounts concern
where in the processes leading to decisions or other actions they
require indeterminism and what other conditions besides indeterminism
they require. The first three sections below examine recent versions
of each of the three main types of incompatibilist view. The fourth
section considers the evidence regarding whether in fact there exists
what any of these accounts requires.

Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (b. 1848, d. 1925) was a German
mathematician, logician, and philosopher who worked at the University
of Jena. Frege essentially reconceived the discipline of logic by
constructing a formal system which, in effect, constituted the first
‘predicate calculus’. In this formal system, Frege
developed an analysis of quantified statements and formalized the
notion of a ‘proof’ in terms that are still accepted
today. Frege then demonstrated that one could use his system to
resolve theoretical mathematical statements in terms of simpler
logical and mathematical notions. One of the axioms that Frege later
added to his system, in the attempt to derive significant parts of
mathematics from logic, proved to be inconsistent. Nevertheless, his
definitions (e.g., of the predecessor relation and of the
concept of natural number) and methods (e.g., for deriving
the axioms of number theory) constituted a significant advance. To
ground his views about the relationship of logic and mathematics,
Frege conceived a comprehensive philosophy of language that many
philosophers still find insightful.  However, his lifelong project, of
showing that mathematics was reducible to logic, was not
successful.

Frege's Theorem and Foundations for Arithmetic,0.8858202695846558,0.70942622423172,"

Over the course of his life, Gottlob Frege formulated two logical
systems in his attempts to define basic concepts of mathematics and to
derive mathematical laws from the laws of logic. In his book of 1879,
Begriffsschrift: eine der arithmetischen nachgebildete
Formelsprache des reinen Denkens, he developed a second-order
predicate calculus and used it both to define interesting mathematical
concepts and to state and prove mathematically interesting
propositions. However, in his two-volume work of 1893/1903,
Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, Frege added (as an axiom) what
he thought was a logical proposition (Basic Law V) and tried to derive
the fundamental axioms and theorems of number theory from the
resulting system. Unfortunately, not only did Basic Law V fail to be a
logical proposition, but the resulting system proved to be
inconsistent, for it was subject to Russell’s Paradox.

Until recently, the inconsistency in Frege’s
Grundgesetze overshadowed a deep theoretical accomplishment
that can be extracted from his work. The Grundgesetze
contains all the essential steps of a valid proof (in second-order
logic) of the fundamental propositions of arithmetic from a single
consistent principle. This consistent principle, known in the
literature as “Hume’s Principle”, asserts that for
any concepts \(F\) and \(G\), the number of \(F\)-things is equal to
the number \(G\)-things if and only if there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the \(F\)-things and the \(G\)-things. Though
Frege derived Hume’s Principle from Basic Law V in the
Grundgesetze, the subsequent derivations of the fundamental
propositions of arithmetic from Hume’s Principle do not
essentially require Basic Law V. So by setting aside the problematic
Basic Law V and the derivation of Hume’s Principle, one can
focus on Frege’s derivations of the basic propositions of
arithmetic using Hume’s Principle as an axiom. His theoretical
accomplishment then becomes clear: his work shows us how to prove, as
theorems, the Dedekind/Peano axioms for number theory from
Hume’s Principle in second-order logic. This achievement, which
involves some remarkably subtle chains of definitions and logical
reasoning, has become known as Frege’s Theorem.

The principal goal of this entry is to present Frege’s Theorem
in the most logically perspicuous manner, without using
Frege’s own notation. Of course, Frege’s own notation is
fascinating and interesting in its own right, and one must come to
grips with that notation when studying Frege’s original work.
But one doesn’t have to understand Frege’s notation to
understand Frege’s Theorem, and so we will, for the most part,
put aside Frege’s own notation and the many interpretative
issues that arise in connection with it. We strive to present
Frege’s Theorem by representing the ideas and claims involved in
the proof in clear and well-established modern logical notation. With
a clear understanding of what Frege accomplished, one will be better
prepared to understand Frege’s own notation and derivations, as
one reads Frege’s original work (whether in German or in
translation). Moreover, our efforts below should prepare the reader to
understand a number of scholarly books and articles in the secondary
literature on Frege’s work, e.g., Wright 1983, Boolos 1990, and
Heck 1993, 2011, and 2012.

To accomplish these goals, we presuppose only a familiarity with the
first-order predicate calculus. We show how to extend this language
and logic to the second-order predicate calculus, and show how to
represent the ideas and claims involved in Frege’s Theorem in
this calculus. These ideas and claims all appear in Frege 1893/1903,
which we refer to as Gg I/II. But we
sometimes also cite to his book of 1879 and his book of 1884 (Die

capture the idea that there is something basic or primitive in the
world. This metaphysical notion is related to the vernacular use of
“fundamental”, but philosophers have also put forward
various technical definitions of the notion. Among the most
influential of these is the definition of absolute
fundamentality in terms of ontological independence or
ungroundedness. Accordingly, the notion of fundamentality is
often associated with these two other technical notions, covered under
 ontological dependence
 and
 metaphysical grounding
 in this encyclopedia.

Why are philosophers interested in fundamentality? One reason comes
from a certain view of science. It is not uncommon to think that
particle physics has some special role in our inquiry into the
structure of reality. After all, every material entity is made up of
fundamental particles. So, one might think that particle physics aims
to describe the fundamental level of reality, which contains
the basic building blocks of nature. We can then employ the notion of
relative fundamentality, which enables us to express the
hierarchical nature of reality disclosed by science, according to
which the facts of biochemistry depend on the facts of elementary
chemistry, which depend in turn on the allegedly fundamental facts of
fundamental particle physics.

The thought that this priority ordering terminates at the fundamental
level is often expressed with the notion of well-foundedness.
The view that reality is well-founded in the relevant sense is called
metaphysical foundationalism, in contrast with
metaphysical infinitism. A further option, which undermines
the priority ordering and suggests that dependence chains can form
loops, is called metaphysical coherentism.

We can identify two key tasks for the notion of fundamentality. The
first is to capture the idea that there is a foundation of being,
which consists of independent entities. The second is to
capture the idea that the fundamental entities constitute a
complete basis that all else depends on. These tasks are
related. In fact, the first would seem to require the second, but not
the other way around. We will see that prioritizing one or the other
of these tasks may result in different accounts of fundamentality. The
second task may be applied to relative fundamentality and used to
express the idea that there is a hierarchy of being whereby some
entities are more fundamental than others, although strictly speaking
this hierarchical picture is independent of the notion of a complete
basis.

This entry will focus on the contemporary discussion, but many of the
ideas debated in the contemporary literature have been around for
millennia. We now have the tools to make these important ideas much
more precise. Relevant historical issues include ancient atomism
(e.g., Leucippus and Democritus, see the separate entry on
 ancient atomism),
 Aristotle’s many discussions of priority (see, e.g., Peramatzis
2011 and the articles in Sirkel & Tahko 2014), Aquinas’s
discussion of the first cause (see the entry on the
 cosmological argument),
 and the
 principle of sufficient reason,
 as discussed by Spinoza and Leibniz, among others.

Future Contingents,0.7285523414611816,0.6261531710624695,"


Future contingents are contingent statements about the future —
such as future events, actions, states etc. To qualify as contingent
the predicted event, state, action or whatever is at stake must
neither be impossible nor inevitable. Statements such as “My
mother shall go to London” or “There will be a sea-battle
tomorrow” could serve as standard examples. What could be called
the problem of future contingents concerns how to ascribe truth-values
to such statements. If there are several possible decisions out of
which one is going to be made freely tomorrow, can there be a truth
now about which one will be made? If ‘yes’, on what
grounds could something which is still open, nevertheless be true
already now? If ‘no’, can we in fact hold that all
logically exclusive possibilities must be untrue without denying that
one of the possible outcomes must turn out to be the chosen
one?[1]

In point of fact, ‘future contingents’ could also refer to
future contingent objects. A statement like “The first astronaut
to go to Mars will have a unique experience” could be analyzed
as referring to an object not yet existing, supposing that one day in
the distant future some person will indeed travel to Mars, but that
person has not yet been born. The notion of ‘future contingent
objects’ involves important philosophical questions, for
instance the issue of ethical obligations towards future generations,
quantification over ‘future contingent objects’
etc. However, this entry is confined to the study of future contingent
statements.
 The problem of future contingents is interwoven with a number of
issues in theology, philosophy, logic, semantics of natural language,
computer science, and applied mathematics. The theological issue of
how to reconcile the assumption of God's foreknowledge with the
freedom and moral accountability of human beings has been a main
impetus to the discussion and a major inspiration to the development
of various logical models of time and future contingents. This
theological issue is connected with the general philosophical question
of determinism versus indeterminism. Within logic, the relation
between time and modality must be studied and various models
satisfying various assumptions with respect to the structure of time
must be developed and investigated. The project of formal semantics
for natural languages also has to address the problem of how to
ascribe a correct semantics to statements about the future. Finally,
it should be mentioned that temporal logic has found a remarkable
application in computer science and applied mathematics (see Hasle and
Øhrstrøm 2004).


In the present context the issue of future contingents will be
approached from the viewpoint of philosophical logic with due
consideration to philosophical-theological origins.

Medieval Theories of Future Contingents,0.6932451725006104,0.15496443212032318,"


The philosophical debate concerning the truth-value of singular
statements about future contingents derives from Chapter 9 of
Aristotle's treatise De interpretatione (Peri
hermeneias). In Chapters 7–8, Aristotle deals with
the contradictory pairs of assertoric statements which divide truth
and falsity so that one is true and the other is false. In Chapter 9
he raises the question of whether this holds for all assertoric
statements or whether there might be an exception with respect to
statements about singular future events or states of affairs which are
neither necessary nor impossible and hence may take place, or may not.
Aristotle's famous example is tomorrow's sea battle. Is the prediction
‘There will be a sea battle tomorrow’ necessarily true, if
it is true, and does its truth entail that the sea battle is
inevitable? After a discussion of deterministic arguments and the
absurdity of fatalism (18a34–19a22), Aristotle gives his
ambiguous reply in 19a23–39. Boethius's (c. 480–524) Latin
translation of De interpretatione had a long commentary
tradition through the Middle Ages, beginning from the eleventh
century. Boethius's own two commentaries were very influential as well
and provided information about other ancient commentaries (Magee
2010). Chapter 9 was also dealt with in theological commentaries on
Peter Lombard's Sentences (I.38) and in separate treatises
(Isaac 1953; Lohr 1967–1974; Craig 1988; Marenbon 1993;
Braakhuis and Kneepkens 2003; Knuuttila 2010). Al-Farabi's
(c. 870–950) commentary on De interpretatione was
influential in medieval Arabic philosophy; Averroes (1126–1198)
wrote another Arabic commentary. (For future contingents in medieval
Arabic thought, see Marmura 1985; Adamson 2006.)

Hans-Georg Gadamer,0.54899662733078,0.4780737161636353,"


Hans-Georg Gadamer is the decisive figure in the development of
twentieth century hermeneutics—almost certainly eclipsing, in
terms of influence and reputation, the other leading figures,
including Paul Ricoeur, and also Gianni Vattimo (Vattimo was himself
one of Gadamer's students). Trained in neo-Kantian scholarship, as
well as in classical philology, and profoundly affected by the
philosophy of Martin Heidegger, Gadamer developed a distinctive and
thoroughly dialogical approach, grounded in Platonic-Aristotelian as
well as Heideggerian thinking, that rejects subjectivism and
relativism, abjures any simple notion of interpretive method, and
grounds understanding in the linguistically mediated happening of
tradition. Employing a more orthodox and modest, but also more
accessible style than Heidegger himself, Gadamer's work can be seen as
concentrated in four main areas: the first, and clearly the most
influential, is the development and elaboration of a philosophical
hermeneutics; the second is the dialogue within philosophy, and within
the history of philosophy, with respect to Plato and Aristotle in
particular, but also with Hegel and Heidegger; the third is the
engagement with literature, particularly poetry, and with art; and the
fourth is what Gadamer himself terms ‘practical
philosophy’ (see Gadamer 2001, 78-85) encompassing contemporary
political and ethical issues. The ‘dialogical’ character
of Gadamer's approach is evident, not merely in the central
theoretical role he gives to the concept of dialogue in his thinking,
but also in the discursive and dialogic, even
‘conversational’, character of his writing, as well as in
his own personal commitment to intellectual engagement and
exchange. Indeed, he is one of the few philosophers for whom the
‘interview’ has become a significant category of
philosophical output (see Hahn 1997, 588-599; also Gadamer 2001,
2003).  Although he identified connections between his own work and
English-speaking ‘analytic’ thought (mainly via the later
Wittgenstein, but also Donald Davidson), and has sometimes seen his
ideas taken up by thinkers such as Alasdair McIntyre (see MacIntyre
2002), Ronald Dworkin (see Dworkin 1986), Robert Brandom (see Brandom
2002), John McDowell (see McDowell 1996, 2002), and especially Richard
Rorty (Rorty 1979), Gadamer is perhaps less well known, and certainly
less well-appreciated, in philosophical circles outside Europe than
are some of his near-contemporaries. He is undoubtedly, however, one
of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century, having had an
enormous impact on a range of areas from aesthetics to jurisprudence,
and having acquired a respect and reputation in Germany, and elsewhere
in Europe, that went far beyond the usual confines of academia.

Galen,0.6259791254997253,0.050753738731145866,"

Galen (Galēnos, 129–c. 200 CE) was primarily a medical
author, but had a deep engagement with and influence on the
philosophical debates of his time. He wrote many works of logic and
ethics, and also addressed those and other philosophical
questions—especially of epistemology, causation in the natural
world, and philosophy of mind—in his medical-scientific
writings. His medical, and in some contexts his philosophical, work
had enormous influence throughout the medieval period and even later,
both in Europe and (through Arabo-Islamic transmission) beyond.
Largely ignored by the intellectual world, including philosophers,
since the Scientific Revolution, he has recently attracted
considerable scholarly attention, especially for his work on
scientific knowledge, his contribution to logic, and his discussions
of ethics, moral psychology and the mind-body problem.

Galen was one of the most prolific intellectuals of western antiquity,
his works extending to 21 volumes of roughly 1000 pages each in the
standard Greek edition (with a few additional works surviving only in
Arabic, Syriac, Hebrew or Latin translations)—a total of more
than 4 million words. While most of his scientific and medical
writings survive, many of his specialist works of philosophy do not.
He is an extremely adversarial author, a vigorous participant in the
highly rhetorical and learned competitive intellectual culture of
second-century-CE Rome (the so-called “Second Sophistic”);
and he is extremely prone to digression. He often expresses his own
views through the twin media of polemic against his opponents and
textual interpretation and commentary on his intellectual heroes
(especially Plato and Hippocrates). And, in spite of his profound
knowledge of the Greek philosophical tradition and
“classic” philosophical texts and his engagement with
philosophical terminology and modes of argument, he does not define
himself as a philosopher, often expressing hostility towards
“school” practitioners of philosophy.

The above very brief introduction to the study of “Galen the
philosopher” may also serve as a preliminary warning of the
peculiar challenges that any such study faces: the vast body of texts,
many both diffuse in structure and unexamined by modern scholarship;
the wide range of genres (most not primarily philosophical),
dialectical contexts and rhetorical arguments from which his
philosophical views must be reconstructed; his eclectic and
decontextualized use of philosophical terminology for his own
purposes; certain specific losses amongst his specialist treatises of
philosophy.

Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) has always played a key role in any
history of science and, in many histories of philosophy, he is a, if

astronomy, and the methodology of science still evoke debate after
over 400 years.  His role in promoting the Copernican theory and his
travails and trials with the Roman Church are stories that still

these aspects of Galileo’s life and work, but does so by focusing in a

"Games, Full Abstraction and Full Completeness",0.8546648025512695,0.8695852756500244,"

Computer programs are particular kinds of texts. It is therefore
natural to ask what is the meaning of a program or, more generally,
how can we set up a formal semantical account of a programming
language. 

There are many possible answers to such questions, each motivated by
some particular aspect of programs. So, for instance, the fact that
programs are to be executed on some kind of computing machine gives
rise to operational semantics, whereas the similarities of programming
languages with the formal languages of mathematical logic have
motivated the denotational approach that interprets programs and their
constituents by means of set-theoretical models. 

Each of these accounts induces its own synonymy relation on the
phrases of the programming language: in a nutshell, the full
abstraction property states that the denotational and operational
approaches define the same relation. This is a benchmark property for
a semantical account of a programming language, and its failure for an
intuitive denotational account of a simple language based on
lambda-calculus has led eventually to refinements of the technical
tools of denotational semantics culminating in game semantics, partly
inspired by the dialogue games originally used in the semantics of
intuitionistic logic by Lorenzen and his school, and later extended by
Blass and others to the intepretation of Girard’s linear logic. This
bridge between constructive logic and programming has also suggested
stronger forms of relation between semantics and proof-theory, of
which the notion of full completeness is perhaps the most remarkable
instance.

Epistemic Foundations of Game Theory,0.7769358158111572,0.892634928226471,"
Foundational work in game theory aims at making explicit the
assumptions that underlie the basic concepts of the
discipline. Non-cooperative game theory is the study of individual,
rational decision making in situations of strategic interaction. This
entry presents the epistemic foundations of non-cooperative
game theory (this area of research is called epistemic game
theory).
Epistemic game theory views rational decision making in games as
something not essentially different from rational decision making
under uncertainty. As in Decision Theory (Peterson 2009), to choose
rationally in a game is to select the “best” action in
light of one’s beliefs or information. In a decision problem,
the decision maker’s beliefs are about a passive state of
nature, the state of which determines the consequences of her
actions. In a game, the consequences of one’s decision depend on
the choices of the other agents involved in the situation
(and possibly the state of nature). Recognizing this—i.e., that
one is interacting with other agents who try to choose the best course
of action in the light of their own
beliefs—brings higher-order information into the
picture. The players’ beliefs are no longer about a passive or
external environment. They concern the choices and the
information of the other players. What one expects of one’s
opponents depends on what one thinks the others expect from her, and
what the others expect from a given player depends on what they think
her expectations about them are.
This entry provides an overview of the issues that arise when one
takes this broadly decision-theoretic view on rational decision making
in games. After some general comments about information in games, we
present the formal tools developed in epistemic game theory and
epistemic logic that have been used to understand the role of
higher-order information in interactive decision making. We then show
how these tools can be used to characterize known “solution
concepts” of games in terms of rational decision making in
specific informational contexts. Along the way, we highlight a number
of philosophical issues that arise in this area.

Game Theory and Ethics,0.4050152003765106,0.8069919347763062,"


Game theory is the systematic study of interdependent
rational choice. It should be distinguished from decision theory, the
systematic study of individual (practical and epistemic) choice in
parametric contexts (i.e., where the agent is choosing or deliberating
independently of other agents). Decision theory has several
applications to ethics (see Dreier 2004; Mele and Rawlings 2004).


Game theory may be used to explain, to predict, and to evaluate
human behavior in contexts where the outcome of action depends on what
several agents choose to do and where their choices depend on what
others choose to do. (See the entry on
 game theory)
 Game theory consequently is relevant to ethics, and it is
used in moral and political philosophy in a variety of ways.


We shall concentrate on the influence and use of game theory in
ethics and those parts of political theory involving norms or
principles of justice, ignoring questions about political and legal
institutions on the one hand and questions about issues dealing with
moral virtues on the other.


One can distinguish three distinctive kinds of inquiries in the
literature. The first we shall call functionalist: game theory
is used to identify the function of morality. It is used to
describe the problem(s) that would occur in the absence of morality,
and inferences about the remedial or ameliorative function of morality
are drawn from this description. The second approach,
contractarianism, uses game theory (especially bargaining
theory) to formalize social contract theory. This older tradition
understands political institutions or norms to be justified to the
extent that rational agents would agree to them under suitable
conditions. Bargaining theory has been used to establish, first, that
there will be agreement in such conditions and, secondly, to predict
the outcome of this bargaining process. Third and finally, game theory,
especially evolutionary game theory, is used to “recover”
many traditional moral norms or practices. In what follows, we shall
consider each of these approaches and the results and problems they
have encountered. We shall start with some historical background.

Pierre Gassendi,0.6115657687187195,0.03302622586488724,"


Pierre Gassendi (b. 1592, d. 1655) was a French philosopher,
scientific chronicler, observer, and experimentalist, scholar of
ancient texts and debates, and active participant in contemporary
deliberations of the first half of the seventeenth century.  His
significance in early modern thought has in recent years been
rediscovered and explored, towards a better understanding of the dawn
of modern empiricism, the mechanical philosophy, and relations of
modern philosophy to ancient and medieval discussions. While Gassendi
is perhaps best known in history of philosophy for his disputes with
Descartes, his relations with other major figures, including Kepler,
Galileo, Mersenne, Beeckman, and Hobbes, represented even more
important transactions of ideas. And while Gassendi also sought to
communicate anew the ideas of Epicurus, the Stoics, and other earlier
thinkers, his resulting amalgam of perspectives provides a modern view
of his own making, one of the touchstones of philosophy and science in
his times: our access to knowledge of the natural world is dependent
on the constraints and licenses that follow from our epistemic grasp
being limited to information provided by senses.  Through this
arch-empiricism—tempered by his priestly adherence to key
elements of Church doctrine—Gassendi views metaphysics as a
realm for speculation grounded in the possibility of empirical
confirmation, logic as (by turns) a psychologistic and probabilistic
enterprise, knowledge of the external world as built on and forever
subject to sensory-based evidence, and ethics in quasi-hedonist,
possibly quantifiable terms. Gassendi's philosophy is a constant
review of other sources, a thorough consideration of the landscape
into which his own empiricism fits and represents an alternative to
contrasting claims, past and present. What is sometimes thought of as
eclecticism—particularly in the posthumous masterwork, the
Syntagma Philosophicum—actually recasts philosophy as a
fully-referenced scholarly enterprise, advancing historical styles and
rhetorical modes in philosophical research and exposition. In these
changes he matches even the magnitude of innovation that marks his
atomist matter theory, empiricist perspectives, explorations and
defenses of the new physics, objections to the Meditations,
and refutations of contemporary Aristotelians and mystical
thinkers. It has been argued—perhaps unfairly—that
Gassendi's core ideas are better preserved through the medium of
writings by Boyle, Locke, Huygens, and Newton. Yet his presentation of
an empiricism, atomism, and new cosmology in historical and
philosophical context greatly advanced the community of scholarship in
his day, and represents what was then a fairly new model of research
and exposition—still in philosophical use today.

The Gelukpa (or Geluk) tradition of Tibetan Buddhist philosophy is
inspired by the works of Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), who set out a
distinctly nominalist Buddhist tradition that differs sharply from
other forms of Buddhist thought not only in Tibet, but elsewhere in
the Buddhist world. The negative dialectics of the Middle Way
(madhyamaka) is the centerpiece of the Geluk intellectual
tradition and is the philosophy that is commonly held in Tibet to
represent the highest view. The Middle Way, a philosophy systematized
in the second century by Nāgārjuna, seeks to chart a
“middle way” between the extremes of essentialism and
nihilism with the notion of two truths: the ultimate truth of
emptiness and the relative truth of dependent existence. The Geluk

Gene,0.9751262664794922,0.5177674889564514,"
 “There can be little doubt,” philosopher and
biochemist Lenny Moss claimed in 2003, “that the idea of
‘the gene’ has been the central organizing theme of
twentieth century biology” (Moss 2003, xiii; cf. Keller 2000,
9). And yet it is clear that the science of genetics never provided
one generally accepted definition of the gene. More than a hundred
years of genetic research have rather resulted in the proliferation of
a variety of gene concepts, which sometimes complement, sometimes
contradict each other. Some philosophers and scientists have tried to
remedy this situation by reducing this variety of gene concepts,
either “vertically” to a fundamental unit, or
“horizontally” by subsuming them under a general
term. Others have opted for more pluralist stances. As a consequence,
“the gene” has become a hot topic in philosophy of science
around which questions of reduction, emergence, or supervenience of
concepts and theories (along with the epistemic entities they refer
to) are lively debated.  So far, however, all attempts to reach a
consensus regarding these questions have been unsuccessful. Today,
since the completion of the human genome sequence and the beginning of
what is being called the era of postgenomics, genetics is again
experiencing a time of conceptual change. The concept of the gene,
emerging out of a century of genetic research, has been and continues
to be, as Raphael Falk has reminded us not so long ago, a
“concept in tension” (Falk 2000).


The layout of the following article will therefore be largely
historical. There exist several accounts of the historical development
and diversification of the gene concept, written from the perspective
of a history of ideas (Dunn 1965; Stubbe 1965; Carlson 1966, 2004;
Schwartz 2008).  While we will largely follow the conventional time
line of events established by this literature, we will take a slightly
different perspective by looking at genes as epistemic objects,
i.e., as objects subjected to on-going research.  This means that we
will not simply relate established concepts of “the” gene,
but rather analyze how changing experimental practices and
experimental systems determined and modified such concepts
 (see also the entry on
  experiment in biology). After
having thus established a rich historical “panorama” of
the gene as a “concept in flux”, to pick up a suggestive
term introduced by Yehuda Elkana (1970; cf. Falk 1986), some more
general philosophical themes will be briefly addressed, for which the
gene has served as a convenient “handle” in
discussion. These revolve around the topic of reduction, but also
involve questions about causality in living systems (for fuller
accounts see entries on
 molecular biology,
 molecular genetics,
 biological information, and
 reductionism in biology;

 regarding genetics, see Griffiths and Stotz 2013).

Early Philosophical Interpretations of General Relativity,0.8836629390716553,0.3967418670654297,"

Early philosophical interpretations of the general theory of
relativity selected distinct aspects of that theory for favored
recognition. Followers of Mach initially lauded Einstein’s
attempt to implement a “relativization of inertia” in the
general theory, but ultimately were more comfortable with
Einstein’s operationalist treatment of the concept of distant
simultaneity in the special theory. Kantians and neo-Kantians, if
freed from strict fealty to the doctrines of the Transcendental
Aesthetic and Transcendental Analytic, pointed to the surpassing
importance of certain synthetic “intellectual forms” in
the general theory, above all, the principle of general covariance. To
an emerging logical empiricism, the philosophical significance of
relativity theory was above all methodological, that conventions must
first be laid down in order to express the empirical content of a
physical theory. In a more far reaching development, already by its
completion in November 1915, attempts were made to extend general
relativity’s geometrization of gravitational force to
non-gravitational interactions, in particular, to electromagnetism.
Among these, that of Weyl, and shortly thereafter of Eddington, may be
distinguished from others, in particular from Einstein’s many
subsequent proposals. Weyl and Eddington aimed not only at a unified

Generic Generalizations,0.7446184754371643,0.6866010427474976,"

Generics are statements such as “tigers are striped”,
“a duck lays eggs”, “the dodo is extinct”, and
“ticks carry Lyme disease”. Generics express
generalizations, but unlike quantified statements, generics do not
carry information about how many members of the kind or category have
the property. For example, if asked “how many ravens are
black?” one could reply “all [or some, or most, etc.]
ravens are black”, but one cannot felicitously reply with the
generic “ravens are black” (Carlson 1977).

Generics have proved quite difficult to analyze semantically. For
example, “dogs are mammals” seems to require for its truth
that all dogs be mammals. “A tiger is striped” or
“ravens are black”, however, are somewhat more forgiving,
since they are compatible with the existence of a few stripeless
tigers and white albino ravens. “Ducks lay eggs” and
“a lion has a mane” are more forgiving still; these
generics are true even though it is only the mature members of one sex
that possess the relevant properties. Notice, however, that we do not
accept “ducks are female”, even though every egg-laying
duck is a female duck. Finally, we accept “ticks carry Lyme
disease”, even though very few ticks (approximately one percent)
actually have the property, while also rejecting “humans are
right-handed”, when over ninety percent of humans are
right-handed.

As these examples illustrate, generics are not equivalent in meaning
to any of the quantifying determiners such as “all”,
“some”, or “most”. They also differ in meaning
from sentences containing adverbs of quantification (Lewis 1975) such
as “generally”, “usually”, or
“often”. For example, the generic “books are
paperbacks” is false, yet the insertion of any of these adverbs
of quantification would render the statement true: “books are
generally/usually/often paperbacks”.

Genetic Drift,0.998843550682068,0.5531037449836731,"

In the 1950s, a lively debate broke out among biologists that
continues to this day, over what might seem like the most unlikely of
organisms: the land snail, Cepaea nemoralis. Yet, there are
in fact some interesting aspects to C. nemoralis. This
species of snail is polymorphic; the snail’s shell varies in
color (pink, brown, and yellow) as well as the number of visible bands
(anywhere from 0–5). But the colors and bands are not equally
distributed across populations. In some populations, pink
predominates, whereas in others, yellow or brown, and similarly, some
banding numbers are more prevalent in some populations than in others.
Thus, not only are there variations within populations (it is rare to
find a population that is all one color or where all the snails have
the same number of bands), but there are variations between
populations. What is the explanation for this distribution of forms?
Those whose knowledge of evolution familiarized them only with the
theory of natural selection might assume that, for example, that in
the populations where yellow snails were the most prevalent, it was
because they were fitter than the other colors—that there was
some environmental factor that favored yellow over brown and pink. And
that in the populations where brown snails were the most prevalent,
there was some difference in the environment that led them to be
favored over yellow and pink snails. But is there some other
explanation? Perhaps the distributions are in some sense due to
chance, perhaps even in a way that can be modeled mathematically. What
would that mean, and how would you determine which explanation was
correct? The attempt to develop “chancy” explanations that
are alternatives (perhaps complementary alternatives) to those due to
natural selection is what is led biologists to develop models of
genetic drift.

Genetic drift (variously called “random drift”,
“random genetic drift”, or sometimes just
“drift”) has been a source of ongoing controversy within
the philosophy of biology and evolutionary biology communities, to the
extent that even the question of what drift is has become
controversial. There seems to be agreement that drift is a chance (or
probabilistic or statistical) element within population genetics (see
entry on
 population genetics)
 and within evolutionary biology more generally, and that the term
“random” isn’t invoking indeterminism or any
technical mathematical meaning, but that’s about where agreement
ends. Yet genetic drift models are a staple topic in population
genetics textbooks and research, with genetic drift described as one
of the main factors of evolution alongside selection, mutation, and
migration. Some claim that genetic drift has played a major role in
evolution (particularly molecular evolution), while others claim it to
be minor. This article will examine these and other controversies.

In order to break through the logjam of competing definitions of
drift, this entry begins with a brief history of the concept, before
examining various philosophical claims about the proper
characterization of drift and whether it can be distinguished from
natural selection; the relation of drift to debates over
statisticalism; whether drift can be detected empirically and if so,
how; and the proper understanding of drift as a model and as a
(purported) law.

Evolutionary Genetics,0.9939554333686828,0.5518975257873535,"

Evolutionary genetics is the broad field of studies that
resulted from the integration of genetics and Darwinian evolution,
called the ‘modern synthesis’ (Huxley 1942), achieved
through the theoretical works of R. A. Fisher, S. Wright, and J. B. S.
Haldane and the conceptual works and influential writings of  J.
Huxley, T. Dobzhansky, and H.J. Muller. This field attempts to account
for evolution in terms of changes in gene and genotype frequencies
within populations and the processes that convert the variation with
populations into more or less permanent variation between species. In
this view, four evolutionary forces (mutation, random genetic drift,
natural selection, and gene flow) acting within and among populations
cause micro-evolutionary change and these processes are sufficient to
account for macro-evolutionary patterns, which arise in the longer
term from the collective action of these forces. That is, given very
long periods of time, the micro-evolutionary forces will eventually
give rise to the macro-evolutionary patterns that characterize the
higher taxonomic groups. Thus, the central challenge of Evolutionary
Genetics is to describe how the evolutionary forces shape the patterns
of biodiversity observed in nature.



The force of mutation is the ultimate source of new genetic variation
within populations. Although most mutations are neutral with no effect
on fitness or harmful, some mutations have a small, positive effect on
fitness and these variants are the raw materials for gradualistic
adaptive evolution. Within finite populations, random genetic drift
and natural selection affect the mutational variation.  Natural
selection is the only evolutionary force which can produce adaptation,
the fit between organism and environment, or conserve genetic states
over very long periods of time in the face of the dispersive forces of
mutation and drift. The force of migration or gene flow has effects on
genetic variation that are the opposite of those caused by random
genetic drift. Migration limits the genetic divergence of populations
and so impedes the process of speciation. The effect of each of these
evolutionary forces on genetic variation within and among populations
has been developed in great detail in the mathematical theory of
population genetics founded on the seminal works of Fisher, Wright,
and Haldane.


Among the evolutionary forces, natural selection has long been
privileged in evolutionary studies because of its crucial role in
adaptation. Ecological genetics is the study of
evolutionary processes, especially adaptation by natural selection, in
an ecological context in order to account for phenotypic patterns
observed in nature. Where population genetics tends toward a branch of
applied mathematics founded on Mendelian axioms, often with minimal
contact with data, ecological genetics is grounded in the reciprocal
interaction between mathematical theory and empirical observations from
field and laboratory.

The Genotype/Phenotype Distinction,0.98463374376297,0.5173505544662476,"

The predominant current-day meaning of genotype is some
relevant part of the DNA passed to the organism by its parents. The
phenotype is the physical and behavioral traits of the
organism, for example, size and shape, metabolic activities, and
patterns of movement. The distinction between them is
especially important in evolutionary theory, where the survival and
mating of organisms depends on their traits, but it is the DNA, held
to be unaffected by the development of the traits over the life
course, that is transmitted to the next generation. Philosophical
discussion mostly now takes the predominant meanings as given,
focusing instead on questions about the genotype-phenotype
relationship. For example: How can DNA be construed as
information for the processes of development of an organism’s
traits? What is the causal status of DNA versus other influences in
the organism’s development? (see entries on
 inheritance systems
 and
 biological information
 and also Griffiths & Stotz 2013). Without dismissing the
importance of such questions, the focus of this entry remains on the
genotype-phenotype distinction. Given that discussion by
philosophers of this issue has been minimal, this entry cannot take
the standard form of a review of published debates. In order to help
frame and orient readers’ conceptual inquiries, another approach
is needed. The entry builds from the observations that the original
meanings of genotype and phenotype and the distinction between them as
given by Wilhelm Johannsen (1911) were quite different from the now
predominant meaning (given above) and that different kinds of meanings
coexist in Johannsen and up to the present. To make sense of those
observations, Johannsen’s paper is recounted with special
reference to practices or assumptions regarding control of
biological materials and conditions. Subsequent developments are then
described in relation to problems introduced by conceptualizing
heredity on the basis of breeding experiments. This framing brings
into play many areas of philosophical discussions, including the
“New Experimentalism” in philosophy of biology (see entry
on
 experiment in biology),
 abstraction (see entry on
 abstract objects),
 confirmation, ambiguity, Scientific Realism, descriptive versus
normative approaches, and The Social Dimensions of Scientific
Knowledge. At the same time, the framing helps open up questions that
have not been well addressed in those discussions and has implications
for issues that might seem settled to many who, when they invoke the
genotype-phenotype distinction, are simply thinking DNA
versus trait.

Population Genetics,0.9919468760490416,0.5477547645568848,"


Population genetics is a field of biology that studies the genetic
composition of biological populations, and the changes in genetic
composition that result from the operation of various factors,
including natural selection. Population geneticists pursue their goals
by developing abstract mathematical models of gene frequency dynamics,
trying to extract conclusions from those models about the likely
patterns of genetic variation in actual populations, and testing the
conclusions against empirical data. A number of the more robust
generalizations to emerge from population-genetic analysis are
discussed below.


Population genetics is intimately bound up with the study of evolution
and natural selection, and is often regarded as the theoretical
cornerstone of modern Darwinism. This is because natural selection is
one of the most important factors that can affect a population's
genetic composition. Natural selection occurs when some variants in a
population out-reproduce other variants as a result of being better
adapted to the environment, or ‘fitter’. Presuming the
fitness differences are at least partly due to genetic differences,
this will cause the population's genetic makeup to be altered over
time. By studying formal models of gene frequency change, population
geneticists therefore hope to shed light on the evolutionary process,
and to permit the consequences of different evolutionary hypotheses to
be explored in a quantitatively precise way.


The field of population genetics came into being in the 1920s and
1930s, thanks to the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall
Wright. Their achievement was to integrate the principles of Mendelian
genetics, which had been rediscovered at the turn of century, with
Darwinian natural selection. Though the compatibility of Darwinism with
Mendelian genetics is today taken for granted, in the early years of
the twentieth century it was not. Many of the early Mendelians did not
accept Darwin's ‘gradualist’ account of evolution,
believing instead that novel adaptations must arise in a single
mutational step; conversely, many of the early Darwinians did not
believe in Mendelian inheritance, often because of the erroneous belief
that it was incompatible with the process of evolutionary modification
as described by Darwin. By working out mathematically the consequences
of selection acting on a population obeying the Mendelian rules of
inheritance, Fisher, Haldane and Wright showed that Darwinism and
Mendelism were not just compatible but excellent bed fellows; this
played a key part in the formation of the ‘neo-Darwinian
synthesis’, and explains why population genetics came to occupy
so pivotal a role in evolutionary theory.


The discussion below is structured as follows. Section 1 outlines the
history of population genetics, focusing on major themes. Section 2
explains the Hardy-Weinberg principle, one of the most important
concepts in population genetics. Section 3 introduces the reader to
simple population-genetic models of the evolutionary process, and
discusses their significance. Section 4 discusses the status of

been leveled against it. Section 5 examines some of the philosophical

Genomics and Postgenomics,0.9856749773025512,0.4936275780200958,"

About 30 years ago researchers and other stakeholders started setting
up the first genomics initiative, the Human Genome Project (HGP) (see 
the link to All About the Human Genome Project (HGP) in the
 Other Internet Resources section below). 
What was conceived as an audacious plan in the 1980s turned
into an official multi-centre, international program in 1990 and was
brought to a conclusion in 2003.

More than a decade later genomics is still big in business (and big
business): the Obama administration announced in January 2015 that
they intend to sequence one million human genomes (see Precision
Medicine Initiative in the 
 Other Internet Resources section
 below; see also Reardon 2015). Craig Venter, the commercially minded
nemesis of the publicly-funded HGP is also in the mix again, this time
involved in a privately-funded collaboration that aims to sequence two
million genomes over the course of the next ten years (Ledford 2016).
And equally important, we see not only the same players clash again
but also the same promises being made, with talk of
“groundbreaking health benefits” and “new medical
breakthroughs” appearing once again in press releases and other
announcements (see for instance Collins & Varmus 2015 or NIH
2015).

But many things are also different now. For instance, China has
emerged as a major player in the genomics field, with the BGI
(formerly the Beijing Genomics Institute) already announcing in 2011
the aim to sequence one million genomes. Moreover, DNA sequencing is
no longer the only goal of these large-scale initiatives: the new
genomics is of course still a genome-based effort, but it is a
transformed enterprise that also focuses on data about proteins, DNA
 methylation[1]
 patterns or the physiology and the environment of the people studied;
DNA sequence data now forms only part of a much larger picture in the
push for what is called ‘precision’ or
‘personalised’ medicine. Developments such as these have
led many to refer to the present as a ‘postgenomic’ age
(Richardson & Stevens 2015). The goal of this entry is to look at
this constantly developing space of genomic and postgenomic research
and outline some of the central philosophical issues it raises.

Section 1
 will introduce and discuss several key terms, such as
‘genome’ or ‘genomics’.
 Section 2
 will then turn to the question of what it means to read and interpret
the genome. What did the sequencing and the mapping of the human
genome entail and what philosophical issues arose in the context of
the human genome project? How did sequencing evolve into a much larger
‘postgenomic’ enterprise and what issues did this
transformation bring about? To answer the last question
 Section 3
 will consider two different projects, perhaps newly emerging fields,
namely the HapMap project, and metagenomics. In the supplementary
document
 The ENCODE Project and the ENCODE Controversy,
 we will look at the ENCODE project and the controversy that
surrounded it. These three cases will highlight key issues that come
up again and again in the context of genomics and postgenomics.

It is also important to point out what this article is not
about. There are already a number of entries in the Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) that deal specifically with
genes, genetics and also the HGP, and the present entry will not,
therefore, address in much detail the history of, or the philosophical
issues surrounding, the concept of the ‘gene’ (see SEP
entry
 gene,
 but also the entries
 molecular biology,
 molecular genetics, and
 the human genome project),
 or the history of the HGP (see SEP entry,
 the human genome project).
 Broader issues that also play a role in genomics, such as the notion
of biological information and the issue of reductionism have also been
discussed in a set of SEP entries (for more on reductionism see
 reductionism in biology;
 gene;
 HGP;
 and
 molecular genetics
 and for more on the metaphor of a ‘genetic program’ and
biological information see entries on
 biological information;
 gene;
 molecular genetics;
 and
 molecular biology).
 Furthermore, and probably most importantly of all, our focus here
will be on the epistemological, ontological and methodological issues
raised by genomics rather than the ethical, legal and social issues
that the sequencing of DNA inevitably brings up (but see
 HGP
 entry for more on these topics).

Epistemology of Geometry,0.8934948444366455,0.45028698444366455,"


Geometrical knowledge typically concerns two kinds of things:
theoretical or abstract knowledge contained in the definitions,
theorems, and proofs in a system of geometry; and some knowledge of
the external world, such as is expressed in terms taken from a system
of geometry. The nature of the relation between the abstract geometry
and its practical expression has also to be considered.


This essay considers various theories of geometry, their grounds for
intelligibility, for validity, and for physical interpretability in
the period largely before the advent of the theories of special and
general relativity in the 20th century. It turns out that a
complicated interplay between shortest and straightest is at work in
many stages.


Before the 19th century only one geometry was studied in any depth
or thought to be an accurate or correct description of physical space,
and that was Euclidean geometry. The 19th century itself saw a
profusion of new geometries, of which the most important were
projective geometry and non-Euclidean or hyperbolic
geometry. Projective geometry can be thought of as a deepening of the
non-metrical and formal sides of Euclidean geometry; non-Euclidean
geometry as a challenge to its metrical aspects and implications. By
the opening years of the 20th century a variety of Riemannian
differential geometries had been proposed, which made rigorous sense
of non-Euclidean geometry. There were also significant advances in the
domain of abstract geometries, such as those proposed by David
Hilbert. It follows that the terms ‘geometry’ and
‘physical space’ do not have simple meanings in the 19th
century, and changing conceptions of these terms do not follow a
simple pattern of refinement. Their inter-relations therefore also
have a complicated history.

Finitism in Geometry,0.8993542194366455,0.4489795863628388,"
In our representations of the world, especially in physics,
(mathematical) infinities play a crucial role. The continuum of the
real numbers, \(\Re\), as a representation of time or of
one-dimensional space is surely the best known example and, by
extension, the \(n\)-fold cartesian product, \(\Re^{n}\), for
\(n\)-dimensional space. However, these same infinities also cause
problems. One just has to think about Zeno’s paradoxes or the
present-day continuation of that discussion, namely the discussion
about supertasks, to see the difficulties (see
the entry on supertasks in this
encyclopedia for a full treatment). Hence, it is a very tempting
idea to investigate whether it is possible to eliminate these
infinities and still be able to do physics. The first step towards an
answer to that question is to examine whether or not a discrete
geometry is possible that can approximate classical continuous
geometry as closely as possible. For, if such is the case, the latter
geometry can easily be replaced by a discrete version in any physical
theory that makes use of this particular mathematical background.
Straightforward as the task may seem, there are however at least
two ways in which the concept of approximation can be
understood. Suppose that \(T\) is a physical theory that is based on
classical geometry. Then an approximation to \(T\) can mean two
different things:

For all concepts in \(T\), including the geometrical concepts, a
discrete analog is proposed (if such a thing exists), or
An underlying theory \(T^\prime\) is formulated using possibly
different concepts in such a way that the classical concepts can be
derived from \(T^\prime\).

In the sections that follow an overview will be presented of (some
of) the various attempts that fall under (a) or (b). However, before
embarking on this journey, several caveats have to be
mentioned.

Nineteenth Century Geometry,0.8930858969688416,0.4484353959560394,"


In the nineteenth century, geometry, like most academic disciplines,
went through a period of growth verging on cataclysm. During this
period, the content of geometry and its internal diversity increased
almost beyond recognition; the axiomatic method, vaunted since
antiquity by the admirers of geometry, finally attained true logical
sufficiency, and the ground was laid for replacing, in the description
of physical phenomena, the standard geometry of Euclid by Riemann's
wonderfully pliable system. Modern philosophers of all tendencies
— Descartes and Hobbes, Spinoza and Locke, Hume and Kant —
had regarded Euclidean geometry as a paradigm of epistemic certainty.
The sudden shrinking of Euclidean geometry to a subspecies of the vast
family of mathematical theories of space shattered some illusions and
prompted important changes in our the philosophical conception of human
knowledge. Thus, for instance, after these nineteenth-century
developments, philosophers who dream of a completely certain knowledge
of right and wrong secured by logical inference from self-evident
principles can no longer propose Euclidean geometry as an instance in
which a similar goal has proved attainable. The present article reviews
the aspects of nineteenth century geometry that are of major interest
for philosophy and hints in passing, at their philosophical
significance.

that task fell to Christian Thomasius (Thomas) at the end of the
seventeenth century. It was then taken up and further developed in a
theological (pietist) direction by a number of minor figures, the
Thomasians, and reissued in a rationalist direction in the early and

Foundationalist Theories of Epistemic Justification,0.7127737402915955,0.7017085552215576,"

Foundationalism is a view about the structure of justification or
knowledge. The foundationalist’s thesis in short is that all
knowledge or justified belief rest ultimately on a foundation of
noninferential knowledge or justified belief.

A little reflection suggests that the vast majority of the
propositions we know or justifiably believe have that status only
because we know or justifiably believe other propositions. So, for
example, I justifiably believe that there is at least one dog in our
neighborhood, because I justifiably believe that my next door neighbor
has a dog; I justifiably believe that our garbage will get picked up
tomorrow, because I justifiably believe that tomorrow is Tuesday and
that our garbage gets picked up every Tuesday; and I justifiably
believe that there is going to be at least some rain in the next week,
because I justifiably believe that the forecast calls for a good deal
of rain, and forecasts are almost always right when it comes to
similar short-term forecasts in this area. And the dependence seems to
be inferential in nature: in each case, I justifiably believe the
former only because I have inferred it, or at least am readily able to
infer it, from the latter. Foundationalists about epistemic
justification (knowledge) want to contrast my inferentially justified
belief (knowledge) with a kind of justified belief (knowledge) that
doesn’t involve the having of other justified beliefs
(knowledge). There is no standard terminology for what we shall
henceforth refer to as noninferential or foundational justification
 (knowledge).[1]

Many interesting and difficult questions can be raised about the
relation between justification and knowledge, including whether
knowledge should be analyzed in terms of justification, as
epistemologists traditionally seem to have thought, or the other way
 round.[2]
 In what follows we will concentrate on foundationalism about
justification, though much of what we say also applies to
foundationalism about knowledge. 

Epistemologists commonly distinguish between doxastic and
propositional justification. Very roughly, one has
propositional justification when has justification for belief
in a proposition—i.e., when one possesses good reasons,
evidence, or justification to believe a proposition. One has doxastic
justification when one not only has justification to believe a
proposition but also believes the proposition and believes it
at least partly on the basis of good reasons, evidence, or
justification one has. For ease of exposition, much of our discussion
is put in terms that most naturally refer to doxastic
justification—e.g., “justified belief”, “being
justified in believing”. However, even when we use such terms,
we focus on propositional justification (which is also required for
doxastic justification) and assume that the other conditions involved
in believing on a proper basis are satisfied. (For more on the basing
requirement, see the entry on
 the epistemic basing relation.)

debate. In popular discourse, globalization often functions as little
more than a synonym for one or more of the following phenomena: the
pursuit of classical liberal (or “free market”) policies in
the world economy (“economic liberalization”), the growing
dominance of western (or even American) forms of political, economic,
and cultural life (“westernization” or
“Americanization”), the proliferation of new information
technologies (the “Internet Revolution”), as well as the
notion that humanity stands at the threshold of realizing one single
unified community in which major sources of social conflict have
vanished (“global integration”). Fortunately, recent social
theory has formulated a more precise concept of globalization than
those typically offered by pundits. Although sharp differences continue
to separate participants in the ongoing debate, most contemporary
social theorists endorse the view that globalization refers to
fundamental changes in the spatial and temporal contours of social
existence, according to which the significance of space or territory
undergoes shifts in the face of a no less dramatic acceleration in the
temporal structure of crucial forms of human activity. Geographical
distance is typically measured in time. As the time necessary to
connect distinct geographical locations is reduced, distance or space
undergoes compression or “annihilation.” The human
experience of space is intimately connected to the temporal structure
of those activities by means of which we experience space. Changes in
the temporality of human activity inevitably generate altered
experiences of space or territory. Theorists of globalization disagree
about the precise sources of recent shifts in the spatial and temporal
contours of human life. Nonetheless, they generally agree that
alterations in humanity's experiences of space and time are working to
undermine the importance of local and even national boundaries in many
arenas of human endeavor. Since globalization contains far-reaching
implications for virtually every facet of human life, it necessarily
suggests the need to rethink key questions of normative political
theory.

Global Justice,0.4462342858314514,0.6993612051010132,"


On common accounts, we have a state of justice when everyone has their
due. The study of justice has been concerned with what we owe one
another, what obligations we might have to treat each other fairly in
a range of domains, including over distributive and recognitional
matters. Contemporary political philosophers had focused their
theorizing about justice almost exclusively within the state, but the
last twenty years or so has seen a marked extension to the global
sphere, with a huge expansion in the array of topics covered. While
some, such as matters of just conduct in war, have long been of
concern, others are more recent and arise especially in the context of
contemporary phenomena like intensified globalization, economic
integration and potentially catastrophic anthropogenic climate
change.


John Rawls’s Law of Peoples was an especially important
work and greatly stimulated thinking about different models of global
justice (Rawls 1999). Several questions soon became prominent in
discussions including: What principles should guide international
action? What responsibilities do we have to the global poor? Should
global inequality be morally troubling? Are there types of non-liberal
people who should be tolerated? What kind of foreign policy is
consistent with liberal values? Is a “realistic utopia”
possible in the global domain? How might we transition effectively
towards a less unjust world?


Contemporary events also played an enormous role in prompting
philosophical inquiries. Prominent cases of genocide, ethnic
cleansing, forms of terrorism uncommon prior to 2001, intensified
interest in immigration to affluent developed countries, increased
dependence on the labor of those from poor developing countries, and
enormous threats to well-being, security and the environment became
common catalysts for further work. Philosophers began to reflect on
questions such as: Is it ever permissible to engage in coercive
military action for humanitarian purposes, such as to halt genocide or
prevent large-scale violations of human rights? Can terrorism ever be
justified? Should affluent developed countries open their borders more
generously than they currently do to those from poor developing
countries who would like to immigrate to them? Are our current global
economic arrangements fair ones and if not, how should they be
transformed? What responsibilities do we have to one another in a
globalized, post-Westphalian world order? How should we allocate
responsibilities for reducing global injustice in our world, such as
in the case of distributing costs associated with addressing climate
change?


Increased interest concerning issues of global justice has also
coincided with enhanced interest in the place and value of
nationalism. These explorations also track contemporary events such as
nationalist clashes which have spilled over into widespread suffering
(notably in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda), increased calls for
national self-determination to carry considerable weight, such as in
state recognition for Palestinians or Tibetans, and also in the case
of secession (prominently, Quebec). In this area global justice
theorists have been concerned with a range of important questions such
as: Under what conditions should claims to national self-determination
be granted substantial weight? When should self-determination yield to
concern for protecting human rights? Are commitments to nationalism
and global justice compatible? Is genuine democracy only possible at
the state level or are there robust forms of democracy that are
possible in more international fora? How are ideals of democracy best
incorporated into defensible global institutional arrangements? Is
world justice possible without a world state?

enormous and rapidly expanding field of global justice. There are

God and Other Necessary Beings,0.7052813768386841,0.5795085430145264,"
It is commonly accepted that there are two sorts of existent
entities: those that exist but could have failed to exist, and those
that could not have failed to exist. Entities of the first sort
are contingent beings; entities of the second sort
are necessary 
 beings.[1]
 We will be concerned with the latter sort of entity in this article.
There are various entities which, if they exist, would be
candidates for necessary beings: God, propositions, relations,
properties, states of affairs, possible worlds, and numbers, among
others. Note that the first entity in this list is a concrete entity,
while the rest are abstract 
 entities.[2]
 Many interesting philosophical questions arise when one inquires about
necessary beings: What makes it the case that they exist necessarily?
Is there a grounding for their necessary existence? Do some of them
depend on others? If so, how might one understand the dependence
relation?

Pragmatic Arguments and Belief in God,0.7099894285202026,0.7731878161430359,"


Pragmatic arguments have often been employed in support of theistic 
belief. Theistic pragmatic arguments are not arguments for the 
proposition that God exists; they are arguments that believing that 
God exists is rational. The most famous theistic pragmatic argument

 Pascal’s Wager.
 Though we touch on this argument briefly below, this entry focuses 
primarily on the theistic pragmatic arguments found in William James,
J.S. Mill, and James Beattie. It also explores the logic of pragmatic
arguments in general, and the pragmatic use of moral arguments in 
particular. Finally, this entry looks at an important objection to 
the employment of pragmatic arguments in belief formation—the 
objection that evidence alone should regulate belief.

Moral Arguments for the Existence of God,0.539007306098938,0.6487513780593872,"

Moral arguments for God’s existence form a diverse family of
arguments that reason from some feature of morality or the moral life
to the existence of God, usually understood as a morally good creator
of the universe. Moral arguments are both important and
interesting. They are interesting because evaluating their
soundness requires attention to practically every important
philosophical issue dealt with in metaethics. They are important
because of their prominence in popular apologetic arguments for
religious belief. Evidence for this can be found in the amazing
popularity of C. S. Lewis’s Mere Christianity
(1952), which is almost certainly the best-selling book of
apologetics in the twentieth century, and which begins with a moral
argument for God’s existence. Many ordinary people regard
religion as in some way providing a basis or foundation for
morality. This fact might seem to favor religious arguments for
morality rather than moral arguments for religious belief, but if
someone believes that morality is in some way “objective”
or “real,” and that this moral reality requires
explanation, moral arguments for God’s reality naturally suggest
themselves. The apparent connection between morality and religion
appears to many people to support the claim that moral truths require a
religious foundation, or can best be explained by God’s
existence, or some qualities or actions of God.


After some general comments about theistic arguments and a brief
history of moral arguments, this essay will discuss several different
forms of the moral argument. A major distinction is that between
moral arguments that are theoretical in nature and practical or
pragmatic arguments. The former are best thought of as arguments
that begin with alleged moral facts and argue that God is necessary to
explain those facts, or at least that God provides a better explanation
of them than secular accounts can offer. The latter typically
begin with claims about some good or end that morality requires and
argue that this end is not attainable unless God exists. Whether
this distinction is hard and fast will be one of the questions to be
discussed, as some argue that practical arguments by themselves cannot
be the basis of rational belief. To meet such concerns practical
arguments may have to include a theoretical dimension as well.

Ontological Arguments,0.7089245319366455,0.5430075526237488,"


Ontological arguments are arguments, for the conclusion that God
exists, from premises which are supposed to derive from some source
other than observation of the world—e.g., from reason alone. In
other words, ontological arguments are arguments from nothing but
analytic, a priori and necessary premises to the conclusion
that God exists. 



The first, and best-known, ontological argument was proposed by St.
Anselm of Canterbury in the 11th. century C.E. In his
Proslogion, St. Anselm claims to derive the existence of God
from the concept of a being than which no greater can be
conceived. St. Anselm reasoned that, if such a being fails to
exist, then a greater being—namely, a being than which no
greater can be conceived, and which exists—can be
conceived. But this would be absurd: nothing can be greater than a
being than which no greater can be conceived. So a being than which no
greater can be conceived—i.e., God—exists.


In the seventeenth century, René Descartes defended a family
of similar arguments. For instance, in the Fifth Meditation,
Descartes claims to provide a proof demonstrating the existence of God
from the idea of a supremely perfect being. Descartes argues that there
is no less contradiction in conceiving a supremely perfect being who
lacks existence than there is in conceiving a triangle whose interior
angles do not sum to 180 degrees. Hence, he supposes, since we do
conceive a supremely perfect being—we do have the idea of a
supremely perfect being—we must conclude that a supremely
perfect being exists.


In the early eighteenth century, Gottfried Leibniz attempted to fill
what he took to be a shortcoming in Descartes’ view. According to
Leibniz, Descartes’ arguments fail unless one first shows that the idea
of a supremely perfect being is coherent, or that it is possible for
there to be a supremely perfect being. Leibniz argued that, since
perfections are unanalysable, it is impossible to demonstrate that
perfections are incompatible—and he concluded from this that
all perfections can co-exist together in a single entity.


In more recent times, Kurt Gödel, Charles Hartshorne, Norman
Malcolm and Alvin Plantinga have all presented much-discussed
ontological arguments which bear interesting connections to the earlier
arguments of St. Anselm, Descartes and Leibniz. Of these, the most
interesting are those of Gödel and Plantinga; in these cases,
however, it is unclear whether we should really say that these authors
claim that the arguments are proofs of the existence of
God.


Critiques of ontological arguments begin with Gaunilo, a
contemporary of St. Anselm. Perhaps the best known criticisms of
ontological arguments are due to Immanuel Kant, in his Critique of
Pure Reason. Most famously, Kant claims that ontological arguments
are vitiated by their reliance upon the implicit assumption that
“existence” is a predicate. However, as Bertrand Russell observed, it
is much easier to be persuaded that ontological arguments are no good
than it is to say exactly what is wrong with them. This helps to
explain why ontological arguments have fascinated philosophers for
almost a thousand years.


In various ways, the account provided to this point is rough, and
susceptible of improvement. Sections 1–5 in what follows provide
some of the requisite embellishments, though—as is usually the
case in philosophy—there are many issues taken up here which
could be pursued at much greater length. Sections 6–8 take up
some of the central questions at a slightly more sophisticated level
of discussion. Section 9 is a quick overview of very recent work on
ontological arguments:

Godfrey of Fontaines,0.6430647969245911,0.23918890953063965,"


Godfrey of Fontaines was one of the major philosopher-theologians to
serve as Regent Master at the University of Paris in the final quarter
of the thirteenth century, along with Henry of Ghent and Giles of Rome.
After completing philosophical studies in the Faculty of Arts and
beginning to study theology probably by August, 1274, he became Regent
Master in Theology in 1285 and retained this position until 1303/1304.
His greatest contributions to philosophy were in the area of
metaphysics. He was positively influenced by Thomas Aquinas, but
differed with him on various major points, and also seems to have been
influenced by the Arts Master, Siger of Brabant. His might well be
described as a metaphysics of act and potency, since he often turns to
this in seeking to resolve metaphysical problems such as, for instance,
the relationship between essence and existence and between possible and
actual being, the distinction between substance and accidents and
between the soul and its powers, the causes of intellection and
volition, or the nature of prime matter and its relationship to
substantial form. Overall his philosophical thought and especially his
metaphysics is somewhat more Aristotelian and less influenced by
Neoplatonism than that of many of his contemporaries, including
Aquinas.

William Godwin,0.4020647406578064,0.5765430927276611,"

William Godwin (1756–1836) was the founder of philosophical
anarchism. In his An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice
(1793) he argued that government is a corrupting force in society,
perpetuating dependence and ignorance, but that it will be rendered
increasingly unnecessary and powerless by the gradual spread of
knowledge and the expansion of the human understanding. Politics will
be displaced by an enlarged personal morality as truth conquers error
and mind subordinates matter. In this development the rigorous
exercise of private judgment, and its candid expression in public
discussion, plays a central role, motivating his rejection of a wide
range of co-operative and rule-governed practices which he regards as
tending to mental enslavement, such as law, private property, marriage
and concerts. Epitomising the optimism of events in France at the time
he began writing, Godwin looked forward to a period in which the
dominance of mind over matter would be so complete that mental
perfectibility would take a physical form, allowing us to control
illness and ageing and become immortal.

Godwin’s moral theory is often described as utilitarian. He
clearly does play an important part in the history of utilitarianism,
not least for his invocation of both British and French writers in the
tradition, such as Joseph Priestley and d’Holbach and Helvetius,
and for the way that his ethical theory is underpinned by a
distinctive rationalist necessarianism on the basis of which he
insisted on a strong form of first order impartiality. One of
Godwin’s lasting contributions to moral philosophy is “the
famous fire cause”, in which we are asked to consider whom I
should save from a burning room if I can only save one person and if
the choice is between Archbishop Fénelon and a common
chambermaid. Fénelon is about to compose his immortal
Télémaque and the chambermaid turns out to be
my mother. Godwin’s conclusion that we must save the former
relies on consequentialist grounds. However, since his account of the
content of utility is inseparable from the development of truth and
wisdom, and since we can best promote this through the full and free
exercise of private judgment and public discussion, the resulting
position looks more like a form of perfectionism than
utilitarianism.

Godwin’s philosophical importance rests principally on his
Political Justice. He wrote other philosophical works,
The Enquirer (1798) and Thoughts on Man (1831), but
he has become perhaps better known for his novels, the most famous of
which is Things as They are, or The Adventures of Caleb
Williams (1794), and for the part he played in literary London
from 1783–1836—from his heyday in the 1790s as the radical
philosopher who married Mary Wollstonecraft, through the next forty
years in which he was variously the butt of attacks by Thomas Malthus,
Samuel Parr and a host of anti-jacobin scribes, friend of the romantic
poets, publisher and author of children’s books, father-in-law
and sponger off Percy Bysshe Shelley, and historian of the Civil War,
to his final anomalous position as a government pensioner supported by
a Tory administration. His papers and especially his diary, which
sparsely records what he read and wrote and whom he met, provide an
immense resource for scholars of the romantic period.

founders of the modern, metamathematical era in mathematical logic. He
is widely known for his Incompleteness Theorems, which are among the
handful of landmark theorems in twentieth century mathematics, but his
work touched every field of mathematical logic, if it was not in most
cases their original stimulus. In his philosophical work Gödel
formulated and defended mathematical Platonism, the view that
mathematics is a descriptive science, or alternatively the view that
the concept of mathematical truth is objective. On the basis of that
viewpoint he laid the foundation for the program of conceptual
analysis within set theory (see below).  He adhered to Hilbert's
“original rationalistic conception” in mathematics (as he
called it);[1]
and he was prophetic in anticipating and emphasizing the importance of
large cardinals in set theory before their importance became
clear.

Gödel's two incompleteness theorems are among the most
important results in modern logic, and have deep implications for
various issues. They concern the limits of provability in formal
axiomatic theories. The first incompleteness theorem states that in any
consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of
arithmetic can be carried out, there are statements of the language of
F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F.
According to the second incompleteness theorem, such a formal system
cannot prove that the system itself is consistent (assuming it is
indeed consistent). These results have had a great impact on the
philosophy of mathematics and logic. There have been attempts to apply
the results also in other areas of philosophy such as the philosophy of
mind, but these attempted applications are more controversial. 
The present entry surveys the two incompleteness theorems and 
various issues surrounding them. (See also the entry on

projectible and non-projectible predicates.  Other important
contributions include his description of the technique which would

investigation of counterfactuals, his “irrealism”, his
development of mereology (with Henry S. Leonard), a nominalistic
account of logical syntax (with W.V. Quine), his contribution to the

Perfect Goodness,0.5745583176612854,0.6145807504653931,"


Reflection on perfect goodness is most commonly carried out as part
of the project of philosophical theology. One prominent
methodological strand of philosophical theology is perfect being
theology, in which the nature of God is made more explicit by
identifying God as an absolutely perfect being and working out what
features an absolutely perfect being must exhibit (Morris 1989c; Rogers
2000; Nagasawa 2008). As it is a commonplace that one of the
perfections that would have to be exhibited by any being that would
qualify as absolutely perfect is perfect goodness, it is obvious why
philosophical theologians employing perfect being theology would be
motivated to reflect in some detail on the character of perfect
goodness and to consider various challenges to the very idea.


This article will take for granted the importance of situating
reflection on perfect goodness within philosophical theology. But
it should be noted that one need not proceed in this way. One
might instead attempt to reflect on the character of perfect goodness
in a way that entirely abstracts from theological concerns, or indeed
any concerns about the particular being by whom, or by which, perfect
goodness is realized (McGinn 1992; Conee 1994). But typically
such reflection focuses specifically on perfect goodness as realized
in God, a being that exhibits not only perfect goodness, but
every other perfection as well. One might also wonder whether
there is any such thing as a general standard for perfect goodness;
perhaps perfect goodness is kind-relative, such that there is nothing
that privileges the question of what counts as perfect goodness for God
over the question of what counts as perfect goodness for humans, or
angels, or Martians, or any other particular type of rational
being. (Indeed, one might go further, asking why we should
privilege the goodness of rational beings over that of hedgehogs,
movies, or landscapes.) But this article will take the perfect
goodness of God as privileged, and will treat as a crucial difficulty
for some conception of perfect goodness that it cannot be exemplified
with other features that an absolutely perfect being would have to
exemplify.

Gorampa Sonam Senge (Go rams pa bSod nams Seng ge, 1429–89) is
one of the most widely-studied philosophers in the Sakya (sa skya)
school of Tibetan Buddhism. A fierce critic of Tsongkhapa, the founder
of what later came to be known as the Gelug (dge lugs)
school, his works were so controversial that they were suppressed by
Gelug leaders shortly after they were composed. Gorampa’s texts
remained hidden until the early 20th century, when the monk
Jamgyal Rinpoche received permission from the thirteenth Dalai Lama to
collect Gorampa’s extant texts and have them reprinted in
Derge. Today, Gorampa’s philosophy is studied widely in monastic
colleges, not only in those affiliated with his own Sakya tradition,
but also in institutions affiliated with the Kagyu (bka'
brgyud) and Nyingma (rnying ma) schools.


Gorampa, like most Tibetan Buddhist philosophers, considers himself a
follower of the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) school developed by the Indian
philosopher Nāgārjuna in the second century, CE. His views
with respect to particular issues within Madhyamaka, however, differ
significantly from the views of scholars belonging to other sects of
Tibetan Buddhism (e.g., Tsongkhapa and Dolpopa), and at times, his
views even differ from those of other Sakya scholars (most notably
Shakya Chokden). Gorampa’s particular brand of Madhyamaka
philosophy is defined by his understanding of the relationship between
the two truths, the use of negation, the role of logic, and proper
methods of philosophical argumentation.

the core of these grammars are residuated families of type-forming
operations; a hierarchy of typelogical grammars results from the
choices one makes with respect to the structural properties of the
type-forming operations, and the means one introduces to control the

Paul Grice,0.7686706781387329,0.7313175797462463,"


Herbert Paul Grice, universally known as Paul, was born on March 13,
1913 in Birmingham, England and died on August 28, 1988 in Berkeley
CA. Grice received firsts in classical honours moderation (1933) and
literae humaniores (1935) from Corpus Christi College,
Oxford. After a year teaching in a public school, he returned to
Oxford where, with a nearly five year interruption for service in the
Royal Navy, he taught in various positions until 1967 when he moved to
the University of California-Berkeley. He taught there past his
official 1979 retirement until his death in 1988. He was
philosophically active until his death—holding discussions at
his home, giving lectures and editing a collection of his work that
was posthumously published as Studies in the Way of Words. He
is best known for his innovative work in philosophy of language, but
also made important contributions to metaphysics, ethics and to the
study of Aristotle and Kant. His work has also been influential
outside of philosophy in linguistics and artificial
intelligence. Although relatively little work was published during his
life, he had a very wide influence via lectures and unpublished
manuscripts. The best known of these were the William James Lectures
which he gave at Harvard in early 1967 and which circulated widely in
unauthorized manuscript form until they were published as part of
Studies in the Way of Words. He also played cricket, chess
and piano, each at a very high level of accomplishment. A useful
biography including both Grice’s personal and professional life is

the points.

Robert Grosseteste,0.7064309120178223,0.10918764770030977,"
Robert Grosseteste (ca. 1168–1253), Bishop of Lincoln from 1235 to
1253, was one of the most prominent and remarkable figures in
thirteenth-century English intellectual life. He was a man of many
talents: commentator and translator of Aristotle and Greek patristic
thinkers, philosopher, theologian, and student of nature. He was
heavily influenced by Augustine, whose thought permeates his writings
and from whom he drew a Neoplatonic outlook, but he was also one of
the first to make extensive use of the thought of Aristotle, Avicenna
and Averroes.  He developed a highly original and imaginative
account of the generation and fundamental nature of the physical world
in terms of the action of light, and composed a number of short works
regarding optics and other natural phenomena, as well as works of
philosophy and theology. As bishop, he was an important figure in
English ecclesiastical life, focusing his energies on rooting out
abuses of the pastoral care, which in later life he traced to the
papacy itself.  He made a powerful impression on his
contemporaries and subsequent thinkers at Oxford, and has been hailed
as an inspiration to scientific developments in fourteenth-century
Oxford.

Metaphysical Grounding,0.7734718918800354,0.6064779162406921,"
Consider the following three philosophical claims made by Plato,
Russell, and Kripke, respectively: (i) an act is lovable by the
gods in virtue of its being pious, (ii) complexes
exist because simples exist, and (iii) the fact that our use
of the term ‘Aristotle’ is causally connected in the right
kind of way to how it was originally used explains why
‘Aristotle’ refers to Aristotle when we use the
term. There are at least three important observations to make about
these claims.  First, it seems that they aren't identity
claims. Russell's claim seems to be that, while a complex and the
simples that compose it are distinct, we can explain the existence of
the former in terms of the existence of the latter. Second, it seems
that these claims aren't causal in nature. Kripke's claim isn't that
causal facts themselves cause our words to refer to what they do.
Instead, the idea is that certain causal facts non-causally determine
the facts about what words refer to. Third, it seems that these claims
aren't purely modal in nature. The relations of modal entailment,
supervenience, and the like are too coarse-grained to capture what
Plato has in mind. It's necessary that if something is pious, then
it's lovable by the gods. But it's also necessary that if something is
pious, then \(2+3=5\). Plato, however, would presumably deny that
anything is such that \(2+3=5\) in virtue of the fact that it's
pious.
It seems that we make similar claims in everyday life as well as in
the context of philosophy. Suppose you claim that there is a labor
strike due to the fact that the truck drivers are refusing to
work and instead picketing outside their workplace. In making this
claim, you're not saying that for there to be a labor strike just is
for there to be truck drivers who are engaging in these particular
activities, for strikes can involve workers with different
occupations, and there are different ways of striking (e.g., workers
might go to work but carefully follow all safety regulations so as to
impede their productivity). Nor are you claiming that the activity of
the truck drivers concurrent with the strike causes there to be a
strike. A causal explanation of the strike instead would appeal to
certain antecedent events such as how their employer has allotted
payroll deductions and benefits. Finally, you aren't merely claiming
that there is a necessary connection between the concurrent activity
of the truck drivers and the existence of a labor strike. Instead,
you're claiming that the fact that they're refusing to work and
picketing outside their workplace explains why there is a strike in
some metaphysically significant sense. 
Taking such considerations as a point of departure, some suggest
that claims like those described above should be read
as grounding claims—claims about what grounds what. We
begin by addressing five foundational issues about grounding: (i)
whether grounding is unitary, (ii) whether we can analyze the concept
of grounding, (iii) the logical form of grounding statements, (iv) how
grounding is related to explanation, and (v) how it's related to
necessity. Then we turn to the application of the notion of grounding.
In particular, we address how the notion might allow us to profitably
formulate familiar philosophical theses, as well as construct novel
philosophical accounts. We conclude by discussing two further issues,
namely, whether the facts concerning what grounds what themselves have
grounds and skepticism about grounding.

Group Rights,0.4465865194797516,0.7333967089653015,"


A group right is a right held by a group as a group rather than by its
members severally. The “group” in “group
right” describes the nature of the right-holder; it does not
describe the mere fact that the right is confined to the members of a
group rather than possessed by all members of a society or by humanity
at large. Much of the controversy that surrounds group rights focuses
on whether groups can hold rights and, if they can, on the conditions
that a group must satisfy if it is to be a right-holder. Some
proponents of group rights conceive right-holding groups as moral
entities in their own right, so that, as a right-holder, a group has a
being and status analogous to those of an individual person. Others
give groups no such independent standing, but conceive group rights as
rights that are shared in and held jointly by the group's
members. Some opponents of group rights challenge the very proposition
that groups can bear rights. Others do not, but worry about the
threats that such rights pose for individuals and their rights. They,
in turn, are met by claims that individual rights and group rights,
suitably formulated, are complementary rather than conflicting and
that some group rights might even be human rights.

Jürgen Habermas,0.6276342272758484,0.7774656414985657,"


Jürgen Habermas currently ranks as one of the most influential
philosophers in the world. Bridging continental and Anglo-American
traditions of thought, he has engaged in debates with thinkers as
diverse as Gadamer and Putnam, Foucault and Rawls, Derrida and Brandom.
His extensive written work addresses topics stretching from
social-political theory to aesthetics, epistemology and language to
philosophy of religion, and his ideas have significantly influenced not
only philosophy but also political-legal thought, sociology,
communication studies, argumentation theory and rhetoric, developmental
psychology and theology. Moreover, he has figured prominently in
Germany as a public intellectual, commenting on controversial issues of
the day in German newspapers such as Die Zeit.


However, if one looks back over his corpus of work, one can discern
two broad lines of enduring interest, one having to do with the
political domain, the other with issues of rationality, communication,
and knowledge. (In what follows, unnamed citations refer to works by
Habermas; quotations are from the English editions, where

Haecceitism,0.8135499358177185,0.5772668719291687,"
Imagine the following alternative history of the world: Things
are qualitatively just as they actually are. There is no
difference in anything like the shape, size, or mass of objects. There
is no difference in the number of entities. Even so, there is
a non-qualitative difference and it concerns you in
particular. According to this alternative history, you fail to
exist. In your place, there is a distinct individual, Double. Double
has all the qualitative properties, whether mental or physical, you
actually have, but, despite all these similarities, you and Double are
distinct individuals. So, according to this alternative history, you
do not exist.
Is this alternative history of the world a possible one? And what
should we make of other alleged qualitatively indiscernible
possibilities? For example, is it possible for a pair of siblings to
swap their actual qualitative roles—i.e., where the actually
firstborn twin is born second and vice versa—but where
no qualitative features of the world are altered? In a similar vein,
suppose, following Black (1952), that there could be a world
containing only two qualitatively indiscernible iron spheres. Are
there yet other possible worlds where these spheres “swap”
their respective spatial locations or are “replaced” by
numerically distinct yet qualitatively indiscernible
doppelgängers?
An affirmative answer to these questions
entails haecceitism, according to which the world could
differ non-qualitatively without differing qualitatively. So, if the
alternative history described above where Double replaces you is a
genuine possibility, it is a maximal possibility—i.e.,
a total way the world could be—that differs
haecceitistically from actuality. Similarly, if it is possible
for twins to swap their birth orders while leaving all qualitative
matters unchanged, that maximal possibility also differs
haecceitistically from actuality.
According to anti-haecceitism, there are no haecceitistic
differences between maximal possibilities. Anti-haecceitism therefore
holds that the world could not be haecceitistically different without
being qualitatively different. So, for anti-haecceitists, the
alternative history of the world described above is not possible nor
are there are distinct maximal possibilities that differ solely in
terms of individuals “swapping” their qualitative roles or
being “replaced” by non-actual individuals.
This entry is a general overview of the issues raised by
haecceitism and anti-haecceitism. In Sections One through Three,
various formulations of haecceitism are presented and the connections
between haecceitism, haecceities, and essentialism are examined. In
Sections Four and Five, arguments for and against haecceitism are
surveyed. Section Six discusses the scope of haecceitistic differences
and the prospects for accepting only certain kinds of haecceitistic
differences. Finally, Section Seven briefly notes the significance of
haecceitism and its denial within various areas of metaphysics.

Medieval Theories of Haecceity,0.710051953792572,0.2236586958169937,"


First proposed by John Duns Scotus (1266–1308), a haecceity is a
non-qualitative property responsible for individuation and identity. As understood
by Scotus, a haecceity is not a bare particular in the sense of
something underlying qualities. It is, rather, a
non-qualitative property of a substance or thing: it is a
“thisness” (a haecceitas, from the Latin haec,
meaning “this”) as opposed to a “whatness” (a
quidditas, from the Latin quid, meaning
“what”). Furthermore, substances, on the sort of
metaphysics defended by Scotus, are basically collections of tightly
unified properties, all but one of them qualitative; the one
non-qualitative property is the haecceity. In contrast to more modern
accounts of the problem of individuation, Scotus holds that the
haecceity explains more than just the distinction of one substance
from another. According to Scotus, the fact that individual substances
cannot be instantiated — are indivisible or incommunicable, as
Scotus puts it — also requires explaining. In short a haecceity
is supposed to explain individuality.

Judah Halevi,0.5626274347305298,0.19764836132526398,"


Judah ben Samuel Halevi (c. 1075–1141) was the premier Hebrew
poet of his generation in medieval Spain. Over the course of some
fifty years, from the end of the 11th century to the middle
of the 12th, he wrote nearly 800 poems, both secular and
religious. However, because this was a time of intensifying religious
conflict characterized by physical, social, and political upheaval,
Halevi also sought to develop a reasoned defense of the Jewish
religion, which was then under attack on all fronts. Christians and
Muslims dismissed Judaism as a superseded religion and reviled its
adherents as guilty of both blindness and faithlessness. Those more
inclined to philosophy, inside as well as outside the Jewish faith,
found many more points to contest. For some, these included even the
most fundamental teachings of Judaism, such as God's creation of the
world and his involvement in the affairs of mere flesh and blood,
which they regarded as perplexing, at best, or incredible
altogether.


As a young man, Halevi had studied philosophy, and he continued to
follow its evolution in Spain as newer Aristotelian ideas began to
circulate among the courtier classes. However, his reactions to what
he learned were decidedly mixed. As a trained physician, he certainly
appreciated the high premium that the philosophers placed on careful
observation and clear thinking. Lives were saved thanks to such skills
or lost when they were lacking. He also admired the philosophers'
achievements in the formal disciplines of logic and mathematics,
inasmuch as they came as close to generating certainty as anyone could
have hoped. Yet this achievement was also part of a larger
problem. Halevi knew that since its inception philosophy had made the
pursuit of truth in every domain its highest goal.  It persistently
sought to distinguish between opinion and knowledge in order to
replace opinions about all things with knowledge of all things. To the
extent that this project could succeed, those able to acquire such
knowledge, whether theoretical or practical, would presumably be of
one mind about the truth they came to know and also live their lives
in accordance with it. However, Halevi also came to realize that well
before the goal is ever reached, opinions, conventions, and traditions
of all kinds as well as the practices associated with them, would be
rendered questionable or otherwise suspect, because they were not
known philosophically to be true or right. A
consequence of this demotion in status of everything unproved was that
those best equipped intellectually to examine and judge such matters
could, and often did, believe, or allow others to believe, that they
had the requisite knowledge of exactly what others lacked by virtue of
their mastery of logic, theory, and other intellectual
skills. Whether, in fact, lovers of wisdom were also as wise as many
of them or their proponents claimed seemed far from obvious to
Halevi. But how could he even discuss such abstract issues in a work
intended to vindicate the Jewish faith in a time of crisis? How,
indeed, was he to give a reasoned account and defense of Judaism to
his increasingly dispirited or doubting co-religionists, when the
challenges came from so many different directions? Their detractors
had the prestige of power, numbers, worldly success, and specialized
new knowledge to support their claims, while the Jews had only their
history, traditions, and what remained of their faith to fall back
upon.


Ultimately, Halevi opted for a novel, yet entirely appropriate,
solution. He let a widely-attested fact of recent history make the
case for him—the conversion of the Khazar kingdom to Judaism
almost four centuries earlier. The story was well known, even if less
stirring than it was when it first circulated in Spain.  Obviously,
the Khazar king and his people had other, more influential, religious
alternatives to choose from, but they chose Judaism nonetheless
because of a truth that they saw as unique to it.  Surely, the king
must have discussed all this; and if he did, so could
Halevi—within the framework of a dialogue. Indeed, such an
approach would allow him to examine all of the relevant issues in the
course of an on-going series of conversations, just as they are so
often encountered and discussed in real life. What is more, the real
experiences of the past, now presented with the help of all his poetic
gifts, could be drawn upon to refute the calumnies and answer the
objections raised in the present. Through this connection with an
event in history, Halevi's Book of Refutation and Proof on Behalf
of the Despised Religion came to be known more simply as the
Kuzari. Under that title, his book would also become the
emblematic expression of the lived truths of his people and their
faith as these were experienced throughout their history, and, not
surprisingly, one of the most beloved works of the Jewish intellectual
heritage.

Nevertheless an increasing number of scholars from philosophy,

There are roughly two philosophical literatures on
“happiness,” each corresponding to a different sense of the
term. One uses ‘happiness’ as a value term, roughly
synonymous with well-being or flourishing. The other body of work uses
the word as a purely descriptive psychological term, akin to
‘depression’ or ‘tranquility’. An important
project in the philosophy of happiness is simply getting clear on what
various writers are talking about: what are the important meanings of
the term and how do they connect? While the “well-being”
sense of happiness receives significant attention in the contemporary
literature on well-being, the psychological notion is undergoing a
revival as a major focus of philosophical inquiry, following on recent
developments in the science of happiness. This entry focuses on the
psychological sense of happiness (for the well-being notion, see
the entry on 
  well-being).
 The main accounts of happiness in this sense
are hedonism, the life satisfaction theory, and the emotional state
theory. Leaving verbal questions behind, we find that happiness in the
psychological sense has always been an important concern of
philosophers. Yet the significance of happiness for a good life has
been hotly disputed in recent decades. Further questions of
contemporary interest concern the relation between the philosophy and
science of happiness, as well as the role of happiness in social and

Richard Mervyn Hare,0.5922191143035889,0.8218303322792053,"

Richard Hare left behind at his death a long essay titled “A
Philosophical Autobiography”, which was published after his
death. Its opening is striking:


I had a strange dream, or half-waking vision, not long ago. I found
myself at the top of a mountain in the mist, feeling very pleased with
myself, not just for having climbed the mountain, but for having
achieved my life's ambition, to find a way of answering moral
questions rationally. But as I was preening myself on this
achievement, the mist began to clear, and I saw that I was surrounded
on the mountain top by the graves of all those other philosophers,
great and small, who had had the same ambition, and thought they had
achieved it.  And I have come to see, reflecting on my dream, that,
ever since, the hard-working philosophical worms had been nibbling
away at their systems and showing that the achievement was an
illusion. (2002: 269)


Yet his imagination could also be less modest: a gaggle of moral
philosophers is trapped beneath the earth in a smoke-filled chamber;
they talk at cross purposes, and refuse to take the way out into the
open air that he alone has discovered. It was his ambition to have
united elements from Aristotle, Kant, and Mill in a logically cogent
way that solved the fundamental problems of ethics (though leaving
unfinished business), and he usually believed himself to have achieved
this. For much of his career, his “prescriptivism” formed
an important part of the curriculum, certainly in Britain. His
disappointment was not to have persuaded others (an occasional
“we prescriptivists” was always uncertain of reference),
and to have left no disciples; he once told John Lucas that this made
his life a failure. Yet he leaves behind generations of pupils
grateful for the transmission not of a doctrine but of a discipline;
and posterity, while unlikely to ratify the logical validity of his
theory, will have reason to admire it for its uniting of apparent
opposites, freedom and reason, tradition and rationalism, eclecticism

David Hartley,0.0,0.37667375802993774,"


David Hartley (1705–57) is the author of Observations on
Man, his Frame, his Duty, and his Expectations (1749)—a
wide-ranging synthesis of neurology, moral psychology, and
spirituality (i.e., our “frame,” “duty,” and
“expectations”). The Observations gained
dedicated advocates in Britain, America, and Continental Europe, who
appreciated it both for its science and its spirituality. As science,
the work grounds consciousness in neuro-physiology, mind in brain. On
this basis, the central concept of “association,” much
discussed by other British philosophers and psychologists, receives
distinctive treatment: the term first  names the physiological
process that generates “ideas,” and then the psychological
processes by which perceptions, thoughts, and emotions either link and
fuse or break apart. In keeping with this physiological approach,
Hartley offers a conceptually novel account of how we learn and
perform skilled actions, a dimension of human nature often left
unexplored in works of philosophy. Such actions include those involved
in speech—and, by extension, the conduct of scientific
inquiry. As a work on the spiritual condition of humanity,
Hartley’s Observations affirms universal 
salvation—the assurance that all people will eventually become “partakers
of the divine nature.” In this regard, it presents an original
model of psychological growth, which describes how the self both forms
and transforms, as the person gains in “sympathy” and
“theopathy”—put simply, learns to love, both
others and God.


The son of an Anglican clergyman, David Hartley was born in June 1705
in the vicinity of Halifax, Yorkshire. His mother died three months
after his birth, and his father when David was fifteen. After
receiving his B.A. and M.A. from Jesus College, Cambridge, Hartley
practiced medicine in Bury St. Edmunds (1730–35), London
(1735–42), and Bath, where he died on 28 August 1757. He married
twice: in 1730, Alice Rowley, who died in 1731 giving birth to their
son David (1731–1813); and in 1735, Elizabeth Packer
(1713–78), despite the opposition of her very wealthy
family. The couple had two children, Mary (1736–1803) and
Wincombe Henry (1740–94). Although severely afflicted with
bladder stones, Hartley lived a full and active life: he practiced
medicine, engaged in mathematical research, sought a cure for
“the stone,” devoted himself to intellectual and
philanthropic projects, and wrote the Observations on

Charles Hartshorne (pronounced Harts-horne) is considered by many
philosophers to be one of the most important philosophers of religion
and metaphysicians of the twentieth century. Although Hartshorne often
criticized the metaphysics of substance found in medieval philosophy,
he was very much like medieval thinkers in developing a philosophy
that was theocentric.  Throughout his career he defended the
rationality of theism and for several decades was almost alone in
doing so among English-language philosophers. Hartshorne was also one
of the thinkers responsible for the rediscovery of St. Anselm’s
ontological argument. But his most influential contribution to
philosophical theism did not concern arguments for
the existence of God, but rather was related to a theory of
the actuality of God, i.e., how God exists. In
traditional or classical theism, God was seen as the supreme,
unchanging being, but in Hartshorne’s process-based or neoclassical
conception, God is seen as supreme becoming in which there is a factor
of supreme being. That is, we humans become for a while, whereas
God always becomes, Hartshorne maintains. The neoclassical
view of Hartshorne has influenced the way many philosophers understand
the concept of God. In fact, a small number of scholars—some
philosophers and some theologians—think of him as the greatest
metaphysician of the second half of the twentieth century, yet, with a
few exceptions to be treated below, his work has not been very
influential among analytic philosophers who are theists.

dying in 1992.


Hayek worked in the areas of philosophy of science, political
philosophy, the free will problem, and epistemology. For all
that, Hayek was more hedgehog than fox. His life’s work,
for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1974, illuminated the nature and
significance of spontaneous order. The concept seems simple, yet Hayek
spent six decades refining his idea, evidently finding elusive the goal
of being as clear about it as he aspired to be.


This essay concentrates on this enduring theme of Hayek’s work,

Heaven and Hell in Christian Thought,0.5906643867492676,0.6003907322883606,"

Behind the various Christian ideas about heaven and hell lies the more
basic belief that our lives extend beyond the grave (see the entry on
 afterlife).
 For suppose that our lives do not extend beyond the grave. In
addition to excluding a variety of ideas about reincarnation and
karma, this would also preclude the very possibility of future
compensation of any kind for those who experience horrendous
evil during their earthly lives. Indeed, despite their profound
differences, many Christians (though perhaps not all) and many
atheists can presumably agree on one thing at least. If a young girl
should be brutally raped and murdered and this should be the end of
the story for the child, then a supremely powerful, benevolent, and
just God would not exist. An atheist may seriously doubt that
any future compensation would suffice to justify a supreme
being’s decision to permit such an evil in the first place. But
the point is that even many Christians would concede that, apart from
an afterlife, such an evil would constitute overwhelming evidence
against the existence of God; some might even concede that such an
evil would be logically (or metaphysically) inconsistent with his
existence as well.

It is hardly surprising, then, that a belief in an afterlife should be
an important part of the Christian tradition. Even if our lives do
extend beyond the grave, however, the question remains concerning the
nature of the future in store for us on the other side, and the
various Christian views about heaven and hell are proposed answers to
this question. According to a relatively common view in the wider
Christian culture, heaven and hell are essentially deserved
compensations for the kind of earthly lives we live. Good people go to
heaven as a deserved reward for a virtuous life, and bad people go to
hell as a just punishment for an immoral life; in that way, the scales
of justice are sometimes thought to balance. But virtually all
Christian theologians regard such a view, however common it may be in
the popular culture, as overly simplistic and unsophisticated; the
biblical perspective, as they see it, is far more subtly nuanced than
that.

When we turn to the theological and philosophical literature in the
Christian tradition, we encounter, as we would in any of the other
great religious traditions as well, a bewildering variety of different
(and often inconsistent) theological views. The views about hell in
particular include very different conceptions of divine love, divine
justice, and divine grace, very different ideas about free will and
its role (if any) in determining a person’s ultimate destiny,
very different understandings of moral evil and the purpose of
punishment, and very different views about the nature of moral
responsibility and the possibility of inherited guilt. There is also
this further complication: in the Abrahamic family of monotheistic
religions to which Christianity belongs (along with Judaism and
Islam), theological reflection often includes an interpretation of
various texts thought to be both sacred and authoritative. But the
meaning of these texts, particularly when read in their original
languages, is rarely transparent to all reasonable interpreters; that
is, not even all who regard a relevant text as authoritative seem able
to agree on its correct interpretation. Still, despite this
bewildering diversity of theological opinion, there may be a
relatively easy way to identify three primary eschatological views
within the Christian religion and thus to organize the various ideas
about heaven and hell around these three primary views.

Hedonism,0.5289399623870851,0.5530582666397095,"


The word ‘hedonism’ comes from the ancient Greek for
‘pleasure’. Psychological or motivational hedonism claims
that only pleasure or pain motivates us. Ethical or evaluative hedonism
claims that only pleasure has worth or value and only pain or
displeasure has disvalue or the opposite of worth. Jeremy Bentham
asserted both psychological and ethical hedonism with the first two
sentences of his book An Introduction to the Principles of Morals
and Legislation: “Nature has placed mankind under the
governance of two sovereign masters, pain, and
pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to
do, as well as to determine what we shall do”. Debate about
hedonism was a feature too of many centuries before Bentham, and this
has also continued after him. Other key contributors to debate over
hedonism include Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Aquinas, Butler, Hume,
Mill, Nietzsche, Brentano, Sidgwick, Moore, Ross, Broad, Ryle and
Chisholm.


In general, pleasure is understood broadly below, as including or as
included in all pleasant feeling or experience: contentment, delight,
ecstasy, elation, enjoyment, euphoria, exhilaration, exultation,
gladness, gratification, gratitude, joy, liking, love, relief,
satisfaction, Schadenfreude, tranquility, and so on. Pain or displeasure
too is understood broadly below, as including or as included in all
unpleasant experience or feeling: ache, agitation, agony, angst,
anguish, annoyance, anxiety, apprehensiveness, boredom, chagrin,
dejection, depression, desolation, despair, desperation, despondency,
discomfort, discombobulation, discontentment, disgruntlement, disgust,
dislike, dismay, disorientation, dissatisfaction, distress, dread,
enmity, ennui, fear, gloominess, grief, guilt, hatred, horror, hurting,
irritation, loathing, melancholia, nausea, queasiness, remorse,
resentment, sadness, shame, sorrow, suffering, sullenness, throb,
terror, unease, vexation, and so on. ‘Pain or displeasure’
is usually stated below just as ‘pain’ or just as
‘displeasure’. Further economy is sometimes secured by
stating, just about pleasure or just about displeasure, points that do
or might apply to both. Whether such pleasure-displeasure parallels
actually hold is a significant further issue, touched upon only briefly
in the present entry.


What sort of entity is pleasure or pain? Candidates include: state,
state of affairs, thing, event and property. Second, is it a
first-order entity or a higher-order entity? For example, is your pain
your toothache, its naggingness, or both? When you enjoy the cityscape
below your viewpoint, is your pleasure your view, your enjoyment of it,
the pleasurableness of your enjoyment of it, or all three? And so on.
Third, does pleasure essentially have a ‘feel’ or
phenomenology, a ‘something it is like’ (Nagel 1974).
Fourth, does it essentially have directedness or
‘aboutness’ or intentionality? These issues about the
nature of pleasure and displeasure are discussed below (see also the
entry for
 pleasure)
 as they bear on the
nature and merits of various forms of hedonism.

Along with J.G. Fichte and, at least in his early work, F.W.J.  von
Schelling, Hegel (1770–1831) belongs to the period of German
idealism in the decades following Kant. The most systematic of the
post-Kantian idealists, Hegel attempted, throughout his published
writings as well as in his lectures, to elaborate a comprehensive and
systematic philosophy from a purportedly logical starting point. He is
perhaps most well-known for his teleological account of history, an
account that was later taken over by Marx and “inverted”
into a materialist theory of an historical development culminating in
communism. While idealist philosophies in Germany post-dated
Hegel (Beiser 2014), the movement commonly known as German idealism
effectively ended with Hegel’s death. Certainly since the
revolutions in logical thought from the turn of the twentieth century,
the logical side of Hegel’s thought has been largely forgotten,
although his political and social philosophy and theological views
have continued to find interest and support. Since the 1970s, however,
a degree of more general philosophical interest in Hegel’s
systematic thought has been revived.

specific criteria of adequacy. With Rudolf Carnap and Hans

philosophical movement of the 1930s and 40s, which was known as
“logical positivism”, into the more nuanced position known
as “logical empiricism”. His studies of induction,
explanation, and rationality in science exerted a profound influence

it grounds intentionality in a pre-intentional form of appearing,
namely immanent affectivity or “life”. In the last period

religion and Christianity based on his phenomenology. He is widely

a conservative theologian, engaged in the defence of the Augustinian

Aristotelianism and Arabic philosophy — an impression that
seemed to be confirmed by Henry's participation in the commission set
up by Bishop Tempier in view of the famous condemnation of March
1277. However, the progress of the new critical edition of the
Opera Omnia of Henry — begun in Leuven by Raymond
Macken nearly thirty years ago and now coordinated by G.A. Wilson,
supported by an international team — has already demonstrated
that this evaluation needs to be substantially revised. Indeed, Henry
sought to reconcile traditional Augustinian theories with some of the
basic principles of Aristotelian epistemology and Avicennian ontology,
thereby giving rise to a complex and original synthesis.

Johann Friedrich Herbart,0.6619775891304016,0.445333868265152,"
Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776–1841) is known today mainly as a founding figure
of modern psychology and educational theory. But these were only parts
of a much grander philosophical project, and it was as a philosopher
of the first rank that his contemporaries saw him. Even in his own
day, Herbart’s direct influence on academic philosophy was
limited, but this had as much to do with shifting disciplinary borders
as with his polemics against the German Idealists. In psychology and
pedagogy, however, his influence was greater and longer lasting. While
no one took over his philosophy or psychology (and especially the
impenetrable mathematics) as a whole, certain aspects of his thought
proved immensely fruitful. Indeed, without Herbart, the landscape of
modern psychology and philosophy would be unrecognizable.
Though his mathematization of the mind proved a dead end, it
encouraged early experimentalists like Fechner to apply mathematics to
the psyche. His interpretation of space had an important influence on
Helmholtz’s empirical theory of vision, and on Natorp’s
“logicization” of Kantian spatio-temporal intuition.
Herbart’s arguments against psychological faculties were taken
over by Wundt, and his notions of the limen and the
“subconscious” were fundamental to Freud’s
psychoanalytic theory. In philosophy, Herbart anticipated key ideas of
Phenomenology, such as Brentano’s conception of mental
phenomena, and his ideas of representational force,
the limen, and reproduction all find positive endorsement and
development in Husserl’s Phenomenology. Finally, recent
scholarship in both psychology and philosophy is rediscovering
Herbart. For example, Boudewijnse et al.  argue not only for the
contemporary relevance of Herbart’s psycho-mechanics, but also
that it is supported by experiment. And Beiser’s important
contribution to the early history of neo-Kantianism reveals Herbart as
a radical and important interpreter of Kant.

Johann Gottfried von Herder,0.5481142997741699,0.4460195899009705,"

Johann Gottfried von Herder (1744–1803) is a philosopher of the
first importance. This judgment largely turns on the intrinsic quality
of his ideas (of which this article will try to give some impression).
But another aspect of it is his intellectual influence. This has been
immense both within philosophy and beyond it (much greater than is
usually realized). For example, Hegel’s philosophy turns out to
be largely a sort of elaborate systematic development of
Herder’s ideas (especially concerning language, the mind,
history, and God); so too does Schleiermacher’s (concerning
language, interpretation, translation, the mind, art, and God);
Nietzsche is deeply influenced by Herder as well (concerning language,
the mind, history, and values); so too is Dilthey (especially
concerning history); even John Stuart Mill has important debts to
Herder (in political philosophy); and beyond philosophy, Goethe was
transformed from being merely a clever but rather conventional poet
into the great artist he eventually became largely through the early
impact on him of Herder’s ideas.

Indeed, Herder can claim to have virtually established whole
disciplines that we now take for granted. For example, it was
mainly Herder (not, as has often been claimed, Hamann) who established
fundamental ideas concerning an intimate dependence of thought on
language that underpin modern philosophy of language. It was Herder
who, through those same ideas, his recognition of deep variations in
thought and language across historical periods and cultures, his
perception of the fundamental role of grammar in language and of
grammar’s deep variation between languages, his empirical
approach to languages, and in other ways, inspired Friedrich Schlegel,
Wilhelm von Humboldt, and others to found modern linguistics. It was
Herder who developed modern interpretation-theory, or
“hermeneutics”, in ways that would subsequently be taken
over by Schleiermacher and then more systematically formulated by the
latter’s pupil August Boeckh. It was Herder who, by doing so,
also contributed to establishing the methodological foundations of
nineteenth-century German classical scholarship (which rested on the
Schleiermacher-Boeckh methodology), and hence of modern classical
scholarship generally. It was Herder who did more than anyone else to
establish the general conception and the interpretive methodology of
our modern discipline of anthropology. Finally, Herder also made vital
contributions to the progress of modern biblical scholarship.

Heritability,0.9957480430603028,0.5178127288818359,"


A heritable trait is most simply an offspring’s trait that
resembles the parents’ corresponding trait. Inheritance or
heredity was a focus of systematic research before its inclusion as a
key concept within evolutionary theory. An influential 18th
and early 19th century theory of heredity was
preformationism. This view took several forms, each maintaining that
organisms were passed on from one generation to the next, miniature and
yet fully formed, and development was simply the growth of the
miniature organism. Subsequent accounts of heredity included the theory
that organisms inherited traits that their parents had developed
through response to various environmental pressures. This view was
widely held during the 19th century and usually attributed
to Lamarck. Although Darwin also at times defended aspects of
Lamarck’s view, he also clearly articulates and defends the view
that evolutionary change results from natural selection acting upon
inherited traits under variation. Weismann’s experimental
refutation of the inheritance of acquired traits paved the way for the
combination of Darwin and Mendel’s views of the nature of
heredity. The systematic study of heredity in the 20th
century focused on the gene as the unit of heredity. (There is a vast
amount of helpful work on the history of heredity including Keller
(2002), Griesemer (1994), Morange (1998), Moss (2003), Sapp (2003),
Sarkar (1998), Wade (1992), Winther (2000; 2001) and contributors to
Buerton et al. (eds.) (2000).) Two traditions now dominate the study of
heredity: population genetics and molecular biology. The notion of a
quantitative measure of the heritability of any given trait comes from
population genetics and heritability measures are commonly used in behavioral genetics (Plomin et al. 1990 and Plomin et al. 1997 and see Panofsky 2014, Tabery 2014 and Taylor 2014 for critical reflection on behavioral genetics and heritability analysis). The idea that what is inherited is a stock of DNA, or the information contained in the DNA sequence, comes from molecular
biology.


Philosophical discussions of heredity have focused on the
sustainability of heritability analyses and more recently on the units
of heredity. Here I introduce the concept of heritability and the
problems associated with it.

Inheritance Systems,0.9848889708518982,0.5343412160873413,"


Organisms inherit various kinds of developmental information and
cues from their parents. The study of inheritance systems is aimed at
identifying and classifying the various mechanisms and processes of
heredity, the types of hereditary information that is passed on by
each, the functional interaction between the different systems, and the
evolutionary consequences of these properties.


It is now common to identify heredity with the transmission of
genes, or even more concretely with the transmission of DNA sequence,
from parents to offspring. It is, however, clear on reflection that
there are other ways in which offspring may receive from parents
resources or cues that affect their development. This is particularly
apparent in humans, and the suggestion that social and cultural cues
may serve as an additional “inheritance system” has been made many
times. These observations, and the models of dual inheritance of genes
and culture (e.g., Boyd & Richerson 1985; Cavalli-Sforza &
Feldman 1981; Durham 1991), are a useful starting point from which to
approach the more general project of elucidating the notion of
inheritance system. Cultural inheritance, however, is a broad category,
whereas the analysis of inheritance systems discussed below tends to be
more fine-grained (see Sterelny 2001, p. 337). The term “inheritance
systems” is used to describe different mechanisms, processes, and
factors, by which different kinds of hereditary information are stored
and transmitted between generations.


We present the discussion of inheritance systems in the context of
several debates. First, between proponents of monism about heredity
(gene-centric views), holism about heredity (Developmental Systems
Theory), and those stressing the role of multiple systems of
inheritance. Second, between those analyzing inheritance solely in
terms of replication and transmission, and views that stress the
multi-generation reproduction of phenotypic traits. A third debate is
concerned with different criteria that have been proposed for
identifying and delimiting inheritance systems. A fourth controversy
revolves around the significance of the “Lamarckian” aspects of some of
the inheritance systems that have been identified, such as epigenetic
inheritance and behavioral inheritance, that allow the transmission of
environmentally induced characters (i.e., “soft inheritance”).


This entry is organized as follows: Sections 1 and 2 provide common
ground and historical context for the discussion. Section 3 discusses
specific accounts of inheritance systems. General evolutionary
implications are presented in section 4. Finally, section 5 summarizes
some of the open questions in the field.

Hermeneutics as the methodology of interpretation is concerned with

products of such actions, most importantly texts. As a methodological
discipline, it offers a toolbox for efficiently treating problems of
the interpretation of human actions, texts and other meaningful
material. Hermeneutics looks back at a long tradition as the set of
problems it addresses have been prevalent in human life, and have
repeatedly and consistently called for consideration: interpretation
is a ubiquitous activity, unfolding whenever humans aspire to grasp
whatever interpretanda they deem significant. Due to its long
history, it is only natural that both its problems, and the tools
designed to help solve them, have shifted considerably over time,

Hilbert's Program,0.8988168835639954,0.6967613697052002,"


In the early 1920s, the German mathematician David Hilbert
(1862–1943) put forward a new proposal for the foundation of
classical mathematics which has come to be known as Hilbert's
Program. It calls for a formalization of all of mathematics in
axiomatic form, together with a proof that this axiomatization of
mathematics is consistent. The consistency proof itself was to be
carried out using only what Hilbert called “finitary”
methods. The special epistemological character of finitary reasoning
then yields the required justification of classical
mathematics. Although Hilbert proposed his program in this form only
in 1921, various facets of it are rooted in foundational work of his
going back until around 1900, when he first pointed out the necessity
of giving a direct consistency proof of analysis. Work on the program
progressed significantly in the 1920s with contributions from
logicians such as Paul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, John von Neumann,
and Jacques Herbrand. It was also a great influence
on Kurt Gödel, whose work on the
incompleteness theorems were motivated by Hilbert's Program.
Gödel's work is generally taken to show that Hilbert's Program
cannot be carried out. It has nevertheless continued to be an
influential position in the philosophy of mathematics, and, starting
with the work of Gerhard Gentzen in the 1930s, work on so-called
Relativized Hilbert Programs have been central to the
development of proof theory.

Philosophy of History,0.6337416768074036,0.554480254650116,"

The concept of history plays a fundamental role in human thought. It
invokes notions of human agency, change, the role of material
circumstances in human affairs, and the putative meaning of historical
events. It raises the possibility of “learning from
history.” And it suggests the possibility of better
understanding ourselves in the present, by understanding the forces,
choices, and circumstances that brought us to our current situation.
It is therefore unsurprising that philosophers have sometimes turned
their attention to efforts to examine history itself and the nature of
historical knowledge. These reflections can be grouped together into a
body of work called “philosophy of history.” This work is
heterogeneous, comprising analyses and arguments of idealists,
positivists, logicians, theologians, and others, and moving back and
forth over the divides between European and Anglo-American philosophy,
and between hermeneutics and positivism.

Given the plurality of voices within the “philosophy of
history,” it is impossible to give one definition of the field
that suits all these approaches. In fact, it is misleading to imagine
that we refer to a single philosophical tradition when we invoke the
phrase, “philosophy of history,” because the strands of
research characterized here rarely engage in dialogue with each other.
Still, we can usefully think of philosophers' writings about history
as clustering around several large questions, involving metaphysics,
hermeneutics, epistemology, and historicism: (1) What does history
consist of—individual actions, social structures, periods and
regions, civilizations, large causal processes, divine intervention?
(2) Does history as a whole have meaning, structure, or direction,
beyond the individual events and actions that make it up? (3) What is
involved in our knowing, representing, and explaining history? (4) To
what extent is human history constitutive of the human present?

Hobbes's Moral and Political Philosophy,0.5026611089706421,0.4244905412197113,"


The 17th Century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes is now
widely regarded as one of a handful of truly great political
philosophers, whose masterwork Leviathan rivals in
significance the political writings of Plato, Aristotle, Locke,
Rousseau, Kant, and Rawls. Hobbes is famous for his early and
elaborate development of what has come to be known as “social
contract theory”, the method of justifying political principles
or arrangements by appeal to the agreement that would be made among
suitably situated rational, free, and equal persons. He is infamous
for having used the social contract method to arrive at the
astonishing conclusion that we ought to submit to the authority of an
absolute—undivided and unlimited—sovereign power. While
his methodological innovation had a profound constructive impact on
subsequent work in political philosophy, his substantive conclusions
have served mostly as a foil for the development of more palatable
philosophical positions.  Hobbes’s moral philosophy has been less
influential than his political philosophy, in part because that theory
is too ambiguous to have garnered any general consensus as to its
content. Most scholars have taken Hobbes to have affirmed some sort of
personal relativism or subjectivism; but views that Hobbes espoused
divine command theory, virtue ethics, rule egoism, or a form of
projectivism also find support in Hobbes’s texts and among
scholars. Because Hobbes held that “the true doctrine of the
Lawes of Nature is the true Morall philosophie”, differences in
interpretation of Hobbes’s moral philosophy can be traced to differing
understandings of the status and operation of Hobbes’s “laws of
nature”, which laws will be discussed below. The formerly
dominant view that Hobbes espoused psychological egoism as the
foundation of his moral theory is currently widely rejected, and there
has been to date no fully systematic study of Hobbes’s moral

Paul-Henri Thiry (Baron) d'Holbach,0.5661654472351074,0.3399828970432281,"


Paul-Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach was a philosopher, translator, and
prominent social figure of the French Enlightenment. In his
philosophical writings Holbach developed a deterministic and
materialistic metaphysics which grounded his polemics against organized
religion and his utilitarian ethical and political theory. As a
translator, Holbach made significant contributions to the European
Enlightenment in science and religion. He translated German works on
chemistry and geology into French, summarizing many of the German
advances in these areas in his entries in Diderot's Encyclopedia.
Holbach also translated important English works on religion and
political philosophy into French. Holbach remains best known, however,
for his role in Parisian society. The close circle of intellectuals
that Holbach hosted and, in various ways, sponsored produced the
Encyclopedia and a number of revisionary religious, ethical, and
political works that contributed to the ideological basis for the
French Revolution. Despite the radical views of many members of his
coterie, however, Holbach's broader visiting guest list included many
of the most prominent intellectual and political figures in Europe. His
salon, then, was at once a shelter for radical thought and a hub of
mainstream culture.

Holes,0.8909405469894409,0.3533185124397278,"


Holes are an interesting case study for ontologists and
epistemologists. Naive, untutored descriptions of the world treat holes
as objects of reference, on a par with ordinary material objects.
(‘There are as many holes in the cheese as there are cookies in
the tin.’) And we often appeal to holes to account for causal
interactions, or to explain the occurrence of certain events.
(‘The water ran out because of the hole in the bucket.’)
Hence there is prima facie evidence for the existence of such
entities. Yet it might be argued that reference to holes is just a
façon de parler, that holes are mere entia
representationis, as-if entities, fictions.

Homosexuality,0.6229928731918335,0.6439138054847717,"


The term ‘homosexuality’ was coined in the late
19th century by a German psychologist, Karoly Maria Benkert.
Although the term is new, discussions about sexuality in general, and
same-sex attraction in particular, have occasioned philosophical
discussion ranging from Plato's Symposium to contemporary
queer theory. Since the history of cultural understandings of same-sex
attraction is relevant to the philosophical issues raised by those
understandings, it is necessary to review briefly some of the social
history of homosexuality. Arising out of this history, at least in the
West, is the idea of natural law and some interpretations of that law
as forbidding homosexual sex. References to natural law still play an
important role in contemporary debates about homosexuality in religion,
politics, and even courtrooms. Finally, perhaps the most significant
recent social change involving homosexuality is the emergence of the
gay liberation movement in the West. In philosophical circles this
movement is, in part, represented through a rather diverse group of
thinkers who are grouped under the label of queer theory. A central
issue raised by queer theory, which will be discussed below, is whether
homosexuality, and hence also heterosexuality and bisexuality, is
socially constructed or purely driven by biological forces.

Sidney Hook,0.613615870475769,0.7680048942565918,"


The philosophical career of Sidney Hook was characterized by the
length and constancy of his commitment to the philosophy of John Dewey.
Hook was a leading interpreter and proponent of Deweyan pragmatic
naturalism from his years as Dewey's graduate student at Columbia
in the 1920s through the six decades of his philosophical teaching and
writing until his death in 1989. He identified with the attribution
given to him as “Dewey's bulldog.”


Hook's advocacy of the Deweyan position had its particular
focus in the areas of the pragmatic theory of knowledge and in ethical
naturalism. In regard to theory of knowledge, Hook believed that only
the pragmatic account of knowledge, with its instrumentalist emphasis,
provided an adequate explanation of the value ascribed to knowledge in
human experience and a satisfactory answer to the question of why
knowledge was important for human life. In regard to ethical
naturalism, Hook argued that a naturalistic account of the origin and
justification of ethical statements offered a critical yet justified
and objective basis for moral decisions. In his defense of ethical
naturalism, Hook carried out a sustained criticism of opposing theses.
These theses included all forms of moral absolutism that were derived
from inherited religious traditions or metaphysical systems of Idealism
or Intuitionism. They also included the variants of what he considered
to be moral relativism or moral nihilism, whether these were derived
from arbitrary commitments as in Existentialist philosophy, or were
supported as expressions of emotive attitudes as in Logical
Positivism.


In the tradition of Deweyan pragmatism, Hook sought to apply the
pragmatic interpretation of ethics to diverse areas of social action
including issues of educational policy, cultural freedom and societal
change. Hook's application of normative ethical judgments to
contemporary social and political issues was marked by a significant
reversal. In his early phase through the 1930s, Hook's approach
could be understood as a form of radical liberalism which was
particularly marked by his support for Marxism as an application of
scientific method for the resolution of the problematic situation of
capitalist societies during that period. Hook's involvement in
Marxism, however, eventually led him to his becoming a leading advocate
of anti-communist policy, both in foreign affairs and domestic
institutions. In the later phase of his career, after his reaction to
the programs of the “New Left” in the 1960s, Hook's
approach could be understood as a form of conservative liberalism.
Hook's initial stress upon freedom of inquiry in education
practice was augmented by his emphasis upon the continuity in the
curriculum of Western humanistic cultural traditions. Similarly,
Hook's initial support for social democracy was augmented by his
opposition to the totalitarian potential that had emerged within
socialist and radical movements in contemporary history. Accordingly,
in Hook's final phase as a public philosopher, his writings were
identified with the neoconservative movement.

Hope,0.6739144921302795,0.795551061630249,"

Discussions of hope can be found throughout the history of philosophy
and across all Western philosophical traditions, even though
philosophy has traditionally not paid the same attention to hope as it
has to attitudes like belief and desire. However, even though hope has
historically only rarely been discussed systematically—with
important exceptions, such as Aquinas, Bloch and Marcel—almost
all major philosophers acknowledge that hope plays an important role
in regard to human motivation, religious belief or politics.
Historically, discussions of the importance of hope were often
embedded in particular philosophical projects. More recent discussions
of hope provide independent accounts of its nature and its relation to
other mental phenomena, such as desire, intention and optimism.

Max Horkheimer (1895–1973) was a leader of the
“Frankfurt School,” a group of philosophers and social
scientists associated with the Institut für Sozialforschung
(Institute of Social Research) in Frankfurt am Main.  Horkheimer was
the director of the Institute and Professor of Social Philosophy at
the University of Frankfurt from 1930–1933, and again from
1949–1958.  In between those periods he would lead the Institute
in exile, primarily in America.  As a philosopher he is best known
(especially in the Anglophone world), for his work during the 1940s,
including Dialectic of Enlightenment, which was co-authored with
Theodor Adorno.  While deservedly influential, Dialectic of
Enlightenment (and other works from that period) should not be
separated from the context of Horkheimer’s work as a whole. Especially
important in this regard are the writings from the 1930s, which were
largely responsible for developing the epistemological and
methodological orientation of Frankfurt School critical theory.  This
work both influenced his contemporaries (including Adorno and Herbert
Marcuse) and has had an enduring influence on critical theory’s later
practitioners (including Jürgen Habermas, and the Institute’s
current director Axel Honneth).

The Human Genome Project,0.9852721095085144,0.49526646733284,"


The century that opened with rediscoveries of Gregor Mendel's
studies on patterns of inheritance in peas closed with a research
project in molecular biology heralded as the initial and necessary step
for attaining a complete understanding of the hereditary nature of
humankind. Both basic science and technological feat, the Human Genome
Project (HGP) brought to biology a “big science” model
previously confined to physics. Although originating and centered in
the U.S., laboratories across the globe contributed to the mapping and
sequencing of the haploid human genome's 22 autosomes and 2 sex
chromosomes.


The official date of completion was timed to coincide with
celebrations of the 50th anniversary of James D. Watson and
Francis Crick's discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA.
On 12 April 2003, heads of government of the six countries which
contributed to the sequencing efforts (the U.S., the U.K., Japan,
France, Germany, and China) issued a joint proclamation that the
“essential sequence of three billion base pairs of DNA of the
Human Genome, the molecular instruction book of human life,” had
been achieved (Dept. of Trade 2003). HGP researchers compared their
feat to the Apollo moon landing and splitting the atom, foreseeing the
dawn of a new era, “the era of the genome” (NHGRI
2003).


What does the “era of the genome” promise? Bruce
Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences, characterized
the completed human genome sequence as a “tremendous foundation
on which to build the science and medicine of the 21st
century” (NHGRI 2003). The statement released by the six world
leaders in April 2003 expressed the hope that this progress in science
and medicine would establish “a healthier future for all the
peoples of the globe” (Dept. of Trade 2003). Philosophical
interest in the HGP centers on claims and hopes of this sort and raises
a number of questions: How can DNA sequence information provide
foundations for scientific and medical knowledge? Who will have access
to the potential benefits arising from this research, and will such
benefits be justly distributed? What possible harms lie ahead?



This article provides a brief history of the HGP and discusses a
range of associated issues that gained the attention of philosophers
during the project's planning stages and as it unfolded.
Prominent among philosophical concerns are the conceptual foundations
of the project and its ethical implications.

Human Rights,0.444767028093338,0.7363359928131104,"


Human rights are norms that help to protect all people everywhere from
severe political, legal, and social abuses. Examples of human rights
are the right to freedom of religion, the right to a fair trial when
charged with a crime, the right not to be tortured, and the right to
engage in political activity. These rights exist in morality and in
law at the national and international levels. Historical sources for
bills of rights include the Magna Carta (1215), the English Bill of
Rights (1689), the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the
Citizen (1789), and the Bill of Rights in the United States
Constitution (1791). Early philosophical sources of the idea of human
rights include Francisco Suarez (1548–1617),
 Hugo Grotius (1583–1645),
 Samuel Pufendorf (1632–1694),
 John Locke (1632–1704),
 and Immanuel Kant (1724–1804). 
 The main sources of the contemporary conception of human rights are the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (United Nations, 1948b) 
and the many human rights documents and treaties that followed in
international organizations such as the United Nations, the Council of
Europe, the Organization of American States, and the African Union (on
the early history of human rights see Tierney 2001 and Griffin 2008;
for the history of the Universal Declaration see Glendon 2001, Lauren
1998, and Morsink 1999; and for the recent history of international
human rights see Moyn 2010 and Jean Cohen 2012).

The philosophy of human rights addresses questions about the
existence, content, nature, universality, justification, and legal
status of human rights. The strong claims made on behalf of human
rights (for example, that they are universal, or that they exist
independently of legal enactment as justified moral norms) frequently
provoke skeptical doubts and countering philosophical
defences (on these critiques see Waldron 1988 and the entry on
 rights). Reflection on these doubts and 
the responses that can be
made to them has become a sub-field of political and legal philosophy
with a substantial literature (see the
 Bibliography below).

This entry includes a lengthy fifth section, 
 International Human Rights Law and Organizations, 
that offers a comprehensive survey of today's
international system for the promotion and protection of human
rights.

Wilhelm von Humboldt,0.5299093127250671,0.4532378315925598,"

Wilhelm (Friedrich Wilhelm Christian Karl Ferdinand) von Humboldt,
German man of letters extraordinary, close friend of the poets Goethe
and Schiller, whose life’s work encompasses the areas of philosophy,
literature, linguistics, anthropology, education, and political
thought as well statesmanship was born in Potsdam on June 23, 1767 and
died at Tegel near Berlin on April 8, 1835. Although there has always
been strong interest in Humboldt expressed by political and cultural
historians and educationists in Germany, it is only in recent decades
that his contributions to the formation of modern linguistics, to
semiotics, hermeneutics and philosophy of language have given rise to
renewed attention to his pioneering achievements in these areas, even
though much of his work in linguistics has remained unknown or
unexplored until recently. Yet numerous linguists beginning with Pott
and Steinthal in Germany and the American Brinton in the nineteenth
century to Boas, Sapir, Bühler, Weisgerber, and Chomsky in the
twentieth century derived or claimed to have derived important
insights from Humboldt. But their interest in Humboldt was partial at
best and limited to those aspects of his work that could be utilized
to reinforce or to legitimize their own projects and methodologies. It
is quite misleading to associate the term “Humboldtian
linguistics” or “Humboldtian philosophy of language”
with any one specific direction, for example with the Whorfian thesis
of “linguistic relativity” or with Chomsky’s opposite
notion of a universalist “generative grammar” because
these tend to ignore other equally or more important dimensions of
Humboldt’s work. After his death in 1835 his linguistic work was
effectively disregarded by mainstream linguists in Germany whose
primary interest was focused on the Indo-European language group. Thus
a prominent figure like Franz Bopp would maintain that the languages
of the South Pacific represented but decayed forms of Sanskrit despite
the fact that Humboldt had already thoroughly disproved this opinion
in his Kavi Work and demonstrated that these languages constituted
what is called today the Austronesian language group (Mueller-Vollmer
1991). Even the linguist Heyman Steinthal, who published in 1884 a two
volume edition of Humboldt’s writings entitled Die
Sprachphilosophischen Werke Wilhelm’s von Humboldt (Humboldt’s
works in philosophy of language) (see “Works”,
bibliography), in his introduction and commentaries criticises
Humboldt from a reductionist psychologistic position and neither here
or anywhere in his other writings made a serious attempt to discuss
Humboldt’s own arguments and to investigate his actual philosophical
position. In France, on the other hand, we find throughout the
nineteenth century a comparatively sustained interest in Humboldt
that was confined chiefly to his work in the Asian languages and to
his Basque studies. As a member of the Société
Asiatique in Paris he published a number of articles in the
society’s official journal, the Journal Asiatique (for a list
of these articles, see Bösch 2006, p. 234) and the latter in turn
carried reviews of some of his writings. It has to be noted that this
French reception resulted largely from the personal contacts and
scholarly exchanges that he maintained with a number of prominent
French linguists such as Jean-François Champollion, Jean-Pierre
Abel-Rémusat, Eugène Jacquet, and Eugène Burnouf.
Yet Humboldt’s French reception, while including some of his important
linguistic studies, all but omitted their philosophical concerns and
underlying principles. Typical is the review of Humboldt’s
groundbreaking treatise from 1827, “On the Dual” that
appeared in the Nouvelle Revue Germanique, I: 378–381
(1829), where the reviewer blended out entirely the philosophical
intent and key argument of the piece (Ibid. 105/6) and thus distorted
beyond recognition Humboldt’s integration of linguistic research and
philosophy of language, which lies at the heart of his linguistic
enterprise. It is only in the late twentieth century that the
philosopher of language and linguist Humboldt has been discovered in
France by men like Henri Meschonic, Jean Rousseau or Denis Thouard
(For their publications see, Bösch 2006, pp. 239f, 243f, and
247f). Surprisingly, Humboldt’s name has been notoriously absent in
the extensive debates prompted by Jacques Derrida and his
Grammatology concerning the role of writing (écriture)
for an understanding of language and culture and its alleged neglect
in the Western tradition because of its inherent phonocentrism. For
Humboldt had in effect produced, on the basis of his extensive study
of the world’s different writing systems past and present, a
comprehensive theory of writing that does not fit into the rubrics of
phonocentrism or eurocentrism. Writing constituted in his view an
essential part of language, the material embodiment of the specific
formative principle a language employs to construct meaning rather
than being the mere representational mirror of speech. For him, the
development of language and writing were mutually dependent on each
other (On this issue see the extensive and groundbreaking work by
Messling 2008).

There was an early presence of Humboldtian ideas in American
linguistics and ethnology dating back to the early nineteenth
century in which Humboldt himself had played an active role. Its
beginning is marked by Stephen S. Duponceau’s (1760–1844)
programmatic report to the American Philosophical Society in
Philadelphia in 1819 on the study the American Indian languages in the
“Transactions of the historical and literary committee of the
American Philosophical Society”, the founding document of
American linguistics, with its reference to Humboldt (Transactions
of the historical and literary committee of the American Philosophical
Society, vol. 1, Philadelphia, 1819) and the ensuing
correspondence between the two men. There is in addition Humboldt’s
important correspondence with the second founder of American
linguistics, John Pickering (1777–1846) who wrote a lengthy
article on the American Indian languages for Francis Lieber’s
Encyclopedia Americana where specific reference is made to
Humboldt’s work (see Pickering 1831). Francis Lieber
(1798–1872), the creator and editor of the Encyclopedia
Americana, besides corresponding with the German linguist,
followed Humboldtian principles or what he understood of them in his
own linguistic work on the American languages (see for example
Lieber’s “The Plan of Thought in American Languages”, in
H. R. Schoolcraf’s History and Statistics of the Indian Tribes of
the United State, vol. ii, 346–349, Washington, 1853). The
most prominent American ethnologist and linguist of the second half of
the nineteenth century, Daniel G. Brinton (1837–1899) was
well acquainted with Humboldt’s work on the American Indian tongues,
as far as it was known then. He viewed his own researches as following
the path that Humboldt had first laid out. There are references to
Humboldt throughout his work, he translated an unpublished treatise of
his “On the American Verb System” and regarded him as
founder of “the Philosophy of Language” (Brinton 1890, p.
332.). Yet what he and his followers understood by this term was
confined largely to the methodological principles that governed
Humboldt’s typological and comparative studies and excluded essential
dimensions and the actual philosophical concerns expressed in his
writings. 

A similar process of partial appropriation has been characteristic
also of the philosophers who paid serious attention to Humboldt’s
views, such as Ernst Cassirer (1923–29), Martin Heidegger (1927,
1959), and more recently Bruno Liebrucks (1965), Hans-Georg Gadamer
(1960, 1965, 1972), and Jürgen Habermas (1985, 1988, 1991). It is
only in the last decades that Humboldt’s philosophical and linguistic
writings have become a focal point of attention in their own right.
Linguists of various orientations, philosophers, historians and
literary scholars of different nationalities alike have examined
Humboldt’s philosophy and linguistic ideas by placing them into a
variety of different contexts.

David Hume,0.5667413473129272,0.5758047699928284,"


Generally regarded as one of the most important philosophers to write
in English, David Hume (b. 1711, d. 1776) was also well known in his
own time as an historian and essayist. A master stylist in any genre,
his major philosophical works—A Treatise of Human
Nature (1739–1740), the Enquiries concerning Human
Understanding (1748) and concerning the Principles of
Morals (1751), as well as his posthumously
published Dialogues concerning Natural Religion
(1779)—remain widely and deeply influential.


Although Hume's more conservative contemporaries denounced his
writings as works of scepticism and atheism, his influence is evident
in the moral philosophy and economic writings of his close friend Adam
Smith. Kant reported that Hume's work woke him from his
“dogmatic slumbers”  and
Jeremy Bentham remarked that reading Hume “caused the scales to
fall” from his eyes.

Charles Darwin regarded his work as a central influence on the theory
of evolution. The diverse directions in which these writers took what
they gleaned from reading him reflect both the richness of their
sources and the wide range of his empiricism. Today, philosophers
recognize Hume as a thoroughgoing exponent of philosophical
naturalism, as a precursor of contemporary cognitive science, and as
the inspiration for several of the most significant types of ethical
theory developed in contemporary moral philosophy.

Kant and Hume on Causality,0.6322593688964844,0.44631075859069824,"


Kant famously attempted to “answer” what he took to be
Hume's skeptical view of causality, most explicitly in the
Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783); and, because
causality, for Kant, is a central example of a category or pure
concept of the understanding, his relationship to Hume on this topic
is central to his philosophy as a whole. Moreover, because Hume's
famous discussion of causality and induction is equally central to his
philosophy, understanding the relationship between the two
philosophers on this issue is crucial for a proper understanding of
modern philosophy more generally. Yet ever since Kant offered his
response to Hume the topic has been subject to intense
controversy. There is no consensus, of course, over whether Kant's
response succeeds, but there is no more consensus about what this
response is supposed to be. There has been sharp disagreement
concerning Kant's conception of causality, as well as Hume's, and,
accordingly, there has also been controversy over whether the two
conceptions really significantly differ. There has even been
disagreement concerning whether Hume's conception of causality and
induction is skeptical at all. We shall not discuss these
controversies in detail; rather, we shall concentrate on presenting
one particular perspective on this very complicated set of issues. We
shall clearly indicate, however, where especially controversial points
of interpretation arise and briefly describe some of the main
alternatives. (Most of this discussion will be confined to footnotes,

Kant and Hume on Morality,0.5541368126869202,0.5919427871704102,"

The relationship between Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) and David
Hume (1711–1776) is a source of longstanding fascination. Kant
credited Hume with waking him from his “dogmatic slumber”,
and he describes the Critique of Pure Reason, arguably
the most important work of modern philosophy, as the solution to
the “Humean problem in its greatest possible
amplification” (Prol 4:260–61). Much of the focus has been
on their respective views in metaphysics and epistemology. Yet, as
Thomas Nagel remarks, contemporary moral philosophy also
“continues to be dominated by the disagreement between these two
giants” (Nagel 2012). Comparing Hume and Kant therefore provides
opportunity to clarify and assess two of the modern era’s most
influential approaches to the central problems of moral philosophy.
Comparing their views also illuminates the landscape of
eighteenth-century ethical thought. Although there are many points at
which Kant’s and Hume’s ethics stand in opposition to each
other, there are also important connections between the two. Kant
shared with Hume some important assumptions about morality, virtue,
and motivation. Indeed, early in his career he had been attracted to
the sentimentalism of Hume and other British moralists, especially
Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746), and the influence lingered long
after he changed his mind about the value of their approach.

For the sake of brevity, this article assumes familiarity with
Hume’s and Kant’s main contributions to moral philosophy.
The aim here is not to summarize their views or compare them on all
matters ethical. Instead, the task is to examine several key areas
where we can reasonably see Kant as responding to or influenced by
Hume, or where comparisons between their views are particularly
fruitful.

Hume's Moral Philosophy,0.5599179267883301,0.5859808921813965,"


Hume’s position in ethics, which is based on his
 empiricist theory of the mind,
 is best known for asserting four theses: (1) Reason alone
cannot be a motive to the will, but rather is the
 “slave of the passions” (see
 Section 3)  
 (2) Moral distinctions are not derived from reason (see
 Section 4).
 (3) Moral distinctions are derived from the moral sentiments: feelings of
approval (esteem, praise) and disapproval (blame) felt by spectators
who contemplate a character trait or action (see
 Section 7). 
 (4) While some virtues and vices are natural (see
 Section 13),
 others, including justice, are artificial (see
 Section 9).
 There is heated debate about what Hume intends by each of these
theses and how he argues for them. He articulates and defends them within the broader 
context of his metaethics and his ethic of virtue and
vice.


Hume’s main ethical writings are Book 3 of his Treatise of Human
Nature, “Of Morals” (which builds on Book 2, “Of
the Passions”), his Enquiry concerning the Principles of
Morals, and some of his Essays. In part the moral
Enquiry simply recasts central ideas from the moral part of
the Treatise in a more accessible style; but there are
important differences. The ethical positions and arguments of the
Treatise are set out below, noting where the moral
Enquiry agrees; differences between the Enquiry and
the Treatise are discussed afterwards.

Hume's Newtonianism and Anti-Newtonianism,0.5701407194137573,0.5664457678794861,"


David Hume's philosophy, especially the positive project of his
“science of man,” is often thought to be modeled on
Newton's successes in natural philosophy. Hume's self-described
“experimental method” (see the subtitle to
Treatise) and the resemblance of his “rules of
 reasoning” 
 (Treatise, 1.3.15)[1]
 with Newton's are said to be evidence for this position (Noxon 1973;
De Pierris 2002). Hume encourages this view of his project by
employing Newtonian metaphors: he talks of an “attraction”
in the “mental world” on a par with that in the
“natural world” (1.1.4.6). Hume infers the existence of
“habits” as a kind of mental “force” (EHU
5.2.2) analogous to gravity; the discovery of the “the
principles of association,” which in the Abstract he
 calls his most important
 achievement [see the section on Association in the 
entry on
 Hume
 in this Encyclopedia], 
 are, then, analogous to the laws of motion. Hume certainly appears to
want his readers to feel that he is modeling his project on the
successes of natural philosophy, exemplified by Newton. In the
“Introduction” to the Treatise and even more
explicitly in the opening pages of EHU (1.15), Hume suggests that his
“science of man” can parallel recent achievements in
natural philosophy (with rather obvious nods to Newton's successes in
planetary astronomy). And at the start of EPM, he echoes Newton's
rejection of “hypotheses” (1.10). There is, thus, no doubt
that Hume wants his readers to believe that Newton forms a kind of
model.


Yet, in the totality of Hume's oeuvre the technical details of
Newton's philosophy are rarely discussed explicitly. In fact, some of
the most sophisticated analyses of the implications of Newton's
philosophy are attributed to Cleanthes, the spokesperson for the
inductive argument from design in the Dialogues Concerning Natural
Religion (Dialogues). While in recent years many commentators
have come to doubt that Philo should be considered a straightforward
spokesperson of Hume's views, few suggest that Hume endorses without
qualification Cleanthes's Newtonian argument from design—the
foundations of which are undermined throughout Hume's writings. But
this raises further complications because Hume can be read as implying
that criticism of the design argument can be generated on strictly
Newtonian methodological grounds: the authority of
“experience”—to which Hume and Newton both
appeal—does not license an inference (supported by analogical
reasoning) to a God-like designer of the universe. This would make
Hume something of an internal critic of Newtonianism (Hurlbutt
1985). The same strategy—generate internal criticism to
Newtonian natural philosophy—may be thought to operate in Hume's
Empiricist attack on the putative meaningfulness of invisible or
theoretical entities (e.g., forces, powers, and masses) that made him
a favorite of Logical
 Positivists early in the 20th century
 [see the entry on 
  Ayer
 in this Encyclopedia]. 
 This Positivist interpretation seemed to go well with Hume's
reputation for skepticism. Yet, as Positivism gave way to Naturalism
as the dominant force in 20th century Anglophone
philosophy, scholarship on Hume has increasingly emphasized the
naturalistic elements in Hume, while reinterpreting, even downplaying,
his skeptical tendencies (Kemp Smith, 1941; Stroud 1977, Garrett
1997). But if by naturalism one (also) means that one is willing
to accept the authority of science
 [see the section on Naturalism and Holism in the entry on 
 indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics
  in this Encyclopedia]
 then one runs into a problem: it is by no means clear that Hume
accepts the independent intellectual authority of natural philosophers
(including Newton) to have the final word in interpreting Newton's
achievements.


Before, turning to discussion of Hume's relationship to Newton and
Newtonianism, one ought to emphasize three problems that beset the
scholarly literature on this topic. First, much scholarship on Hume is
still surprisingly ahistorical; especially among philosophers, it
tends to favor rational reconstruction of arguments over attention to
more contextual forms of interpretation. If such philosophers pay
attention to historical figures, these tend to be other canonical
philosophers: Descartes, Locke, Malebranche, and Berkeley. Second,
even scholars that emphasize the historical Hume (e.g., Wright 1983, Broughton
1987, Bell 1997, Winkler 2000) do not tend to exhibit a working
knowledge of the details of Newton's natural philosophy. Nearly all of
the literature in this genre, most of it quite careful, compares the
details of Hume's philosophy to evidence from various text-books
(often “Newtonian”) potentially available to
Hume. Finally, even the most careful and insightful scholarship on
Hume tends to ignore the recent scholarly literature generated by the
renewed philosophic and historical interest in Newton's philosophy
(Cohen
 and Smith 2002; see also 
 Newton's philosophy
 in this Encyclopedia).

Hume on Free Will,0.5625635981559753,0.5818865895271301,"

But to proceed in this reconciling project with regard to the
question of liberty and necessity; the most contentious question of
metaphysics, the most contentious science… —David
Hume (EU, 8.23/95)


David Hume is widely recognized as providing the most influential
statement of the “compatibilist” position in the free will
debate — the view that freedom and moral responsibility can be
reconciled with (causal) determinism. The arguments that Hume advances
on this subject are found primarily in the sections titled “Of
liberty and necessity”, as first presented in A Treatise of
Human Nature (2.3.1–2) and, later, in a slightly amended form, in
the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (sec. 8).
Although there is considerable overlap in content between these two
statements of Hume's position, there are also some significant
differences. This includes, for example, some substantial additions in
the Enquiry discussion as it relates to problems of religion,
such as predestination and divine foreknowledge. While these
differences are certainly significant they should not be exaggerated.
Hume's basic strategy and compatibilist commitments in both
works remain the same in their essentials


It has become common practice to treat the two sections “Of
liberty and necessity” as self-standing contributions that can be
fully understood more or less in isolation from Hume's
philosophical commitments and principles as found outside these
sections. (Many anthologies present one or other of these sections as
complete statements of Hume's position on this subject.) There
is, nevertheless, an intimate and complex relationship between what
Hume has to say in the sections “Of liberty and necessity”
and his moral psychology and philosophical system as a whole. Neglect
of these features has led to some serious misunderstanding concerning
the character and content of Hume's compatibilism. Having said
this, it is equally important to acknowledge that the established or
“classical” interpretation of Hume's views on this
subject has served as the foundation for the subsequent development of
compatibilist strategy over the past two centuries — especially
as found in various prominent representatives of the 20th
century empiricist tradition (e.g., Ayer, Schlick, et al.).


 This article will be arranged around a basic contrast between
two alternative interpretations of Hume's compatibilist strategy:
the “classical” and “naturalistic”
interpretations. According to the classical account,
Hume's effort to articulate the conditions of moral
responsibility, and the way they relate to the free will problem,
should be understood primarily in terms of his views about the
logic of our concepts of “liberty” and
“necessity”. Free and responsible action, it is said, must
be caused by the agent. There is, therefore, no
incompatibility between free will and determinism. On the
contrary, free and responsible action (logically) requires
causal necessity. So interpreted, Hume's arguments involve (a
priori) observations about the logical relations that hold between the
key concepts involved in this dispute. In contrast with this, the
naturalistic approach maintains that what is essential to Hume's
account of the nature and conditions of responsible conduct is his
description of the role that moral sentiment
plays in this sphere. That is to say, it is one of Hume's primary
objectives to describe the circumstances in which people are
felt to be responsible. When we read Hume's arguments in
these terms, not only does this alter the way we understand his general
theory of responsibility, it also changes the way that we interpret his
core arguments relating specifically to the free will debate (i.e. as
presented in the two sections titled “Of liberty and
necessity”). This contrast between the classical and naturalistic
interpretations is of fundamental importance not only for our general
understanding of Hume's philosophical system but also for any
adequate assessment of the contemporary value and relevance of
his views on this subject. In the final section of this article I
consider the way in which Hume's discussion of free will relates
to his wider and more general irreligious philosophical
intentions, as presented throughout his philosophy

David Hume’s various writings concerning problems of religion
are among the most important and influential contributions on this
topic. In these writings Hume advances a systematic, sceptical
critique of the philosophical foundations of various theological
systems. Whatever interpretation one takes of Hume’s philosophy
as a whole, it is certainly true that one of his most basic
philosophical objectives is to discredit the doctrines and dogmas of
traditional theistic belief. There are, however, some significant
points of disagreement about the exact nature and extent of
Hume’s irreligious intentions. One of the most important of
these is whether Hume’s sceptical position leads him to a view
that can be properly characterized as “atheism”. 

The primary aims of this article are: (1) to give an account of
Hume’s main arguments as they touch on various particular issues
relating to religion; and (2) to answer to the question concerning the
general character of Hume’s commitments on this subject.

Ibn Arabi,0.6165059804916382,0.2409502416849137,"


Ibn ‘Arabî (1165–1240) can be considered the
greatest of all Muslim philosophers, provided we understand philosophy
in the broad, modern sense and not simply as the discipline
of falsafa, whose outstanding representatives are Avicenna and,
many would say, Mullâ Sadrâ.  Western scholarship and much
of the later Islamic tradition have classified Ibn ‘Arabî
as a “Sufi”, though he himself did not; his works cover
the whole gamut of Islamic sciences, not least Koran commentary,
Hadith (sayings of Muhammad), jurisprudence, principles of
jurisprudence, theology, philosophy, and mysticism.  Unlike
al-Ghazâlî, whose range of work is similar to Ibn
‘Arabî, he did not usually write in specific genres, but
tended rather to integrate and synthesize the sciences in the context
of thematic works, ranging in length from one or two folios to several
thousand pages.  Nor did he depart from the highest level of
discourse, or repeat himself in different works. The later Sufi
tradition called him al-Shaykh al-Akbar, the Greatest Master, a
title that was understood to mean that no one else has been or will be
able to unpack the multi-layered significance of the sources of the
Islamic tradition with such detail and profundity.


Ibn ‘Arabî's writings remained unknown in the West
until modern times, but they spread throughout the Islamic world
within a century of his death.  The early Orientalists, with one or
two exceptions, paid little attention to him because he had no
discernable influence in Europe. His works, moreover, are notoriously
difficult, making it easy to dismiss him as a “mystic” or
a “pantheist” without trying to read him. Not until books
by Henry Corbin (1958) and Toshihiko Izutsu (1966) was he recognized
as an extraordinarily broad-ranging and highly original thinker with
much to contribute to the world of philosophy. These two scholars,
however, limited their attention almost entirely to one of his short
works, Fusûs al-hikam (“The Ringstones of the
Wisdoms”). Although Ringstones was the focus of a long
tradition of commentary, it represents but a tiny fraction of what he
offers in his massive al-Futûhât al-makkiyya
(“The Meccan Openings”).  More recently, scholars have
begun to look at this work (which will fill an estimated 15,000 pages
in its modern edition), but less than ten percent of it has been
translated into Western languages and even this has not been explained
and interpreted adequately.


Several scholars have pointed to parallels between Ibn
‘Arabî and figures like Eckhart and Cusanus (Sells 1994,
Shah-Kazemi 2006, Smirnov 1993, Dobie 2009), and others have suggested that he
anticipates trends in physics (Yousef 2007) or modern philosophy
(Almond 2004, Coates 2002, Dobie 2007). The most serious attempt to
fit him into the history of Western philosophy argues that his notion
of barzakh (see section 3.4) offers a viable solution to the
problem of defining the indefinable, which has dogged epistemology
from the time of Aristotle and led to the despair of modern
philosophers like Rorty (Bashier 2004). Other scholars have compared
him to Eastern thinkers like Shankara, Zhuangzi, and Dôgen
(Shah-Kazemi 2006, Izutsu 1966, Izutsu 1977). Nor were the
similarities to Eastern thought lost on premodern scholars; during
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Muslims of China
established a Chinese-language school (the Han Kitab) that drew from
Ibn ‘Arabî's legacy and presented the Islamic
worldview in terms drawn from Confucian thought (Murata et
al. 2008).  Implications of his thought for contemporary concerns
have been addressed by a diverse array of scholars and devotees in
the Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn ‘Arabi Society, which
has been published since 1983.  What follows is an outline of some of
the topics that he addresses.

Ibn Bâjja [Avempace],0.6330199837684631,0.15473230183124542,"

Philosophy in Al-Andalus developed later than in the East; it grew
among Muslims and Jews, since both communities were nurtured by a
common Arabic. The Muslim community was much larger and it defined the
cultural space, a significant part of which was made by Arabic
translations of Greek scientifical and philosophical works.

By the midst of the 10th century CE, materials related to
the circle of the Brethren of Purity were known in al-Andalus
probably brought in by Maslama Ibn Qasim al-Qurtubi
(d. 353/964). But philosophy in its proper sense is first found in
Shelomo Ibn Gabirol or Avicebron (1021–1058). The great figure
of Medieval Judaism who was active in Saragossa was also a talented
philosopher. He preceded, by over two generations, the first Muslim
philosophers of Al-Andalus: Abu s-Salt Umayya ibn ʽAbd
al-ʽAziz ibn Abi s-Salt ad-Dani (d. 1134) and Ibn Bâjja, or
Avempace (d. 1139), the latter being active also in that northern town.

The reasons for the later development of philosophy in Muslim
Al-Andalus, therefore, cannot be explained only by the fact that the
country was situated far away from that nurturing source. The cause is
likely that philosophy was never central to the Islamic intellectual
constellation and that it flourished in peripheral areas, geographical
as well as doctrinal. The greatest evidence is Ibn Sina (d. 1037) who
lived in the Iranian provinces, never visited Baghdad and enjoyed the
patronage of princes friendly to the Shiʻa. Al-Andalus was
peripheral in geographical, but not in doctrinal, terms. The country
followed Sunni orthodoxy and the Malekite school of law prevailed
while Ash‛arite theology was weakly cultivated. When Abu l-Qasim
Saʽid Ibn Saʽid (d. 1070) devoted a chapter of his world
history of the sciences and philosophy to Al-Andalus, his information
about philosophy was significantly scarce (Saʽid 1998:
96–108; 1991: 58–78).  In spite of the circumstances
retarding its development, philosophy in Al-Andalus blossomed into
maturity with Ibn Bâjja.

explication of the biblical book Ecclesiastes, a
philosophical-exegetical monograph entitled Ma’amar Yiqqawu

Identity,0.7625543475151062,0.5360259413719177,"


Much of the debate about identity in recent decades has been about
personal identity, and specifically about personal identity over time,
but identity generally, and the identity of things of other kinds,
have also attracted attention. Various interrelated problems have been
at the centre of discussion, but it is fair to say that recent work
has focussed particularly on the following areas: the notion of a
criterion of identity; the correct analysis of identity over time,
and, in particular, the disagreement between advocates of perdurance
and advocates of endurance as analyses of identity over time; the
notion of identity across possible worlds and the question of its
relevance to the correct analysis of de re modal discourse;
the notion of contingent identity; the question of whether the
identity relation is, or is similar to, the composition relation; and
the notion of vague identity. A radical position, advocated by Peter
Geach, is that these debates, as usually conducted, are void for lack
of a subject matter: the notion of
absolute identity they presuppose has no application; there
is only relative identity. Another increasingly popular view
is the one advocated by Lewis: although the debates make sense they
cannot genuinely be debates about identity, since there are no
philosophical problems about identity. Identity is an utterly
unproblematic notion.  What there are, are genuine problems which can
be stated using the language of identity. But since these can be
restated without the language of identity they are not problems about
identity. (For example, it is a puzzle, an aspect of the so-called
“problem of personal identity”, whether the same
person can have different bodies at different times. But this is just
the puzzle whether a person can have different bodies at
different times.  So since it can be stated without the language of
personal “identity”, it is not a problem about
personal identity, but about personhood.) This article

the debates and suggestions for further reading.

The Identity of Indiscernibles is a principle of analytic ontology
first explicitly formulated by Wilhelm Gottfried Leibniz in his
Discourse on Metaphysics, Section 9 (Loemker 1969: 308). It
states that no two distinct things exactly resemble each other.  This
is often referred to as ‘Leibniz's Law’ and is typically
understood to mean that no two objects have exactly the same
properties. The Identity of Indiscernibles is of interest because it
raises questions about the factors which individuate qualitatively
identical objects. Recent work on the interpretation of quantum
mechanics suggests that the principle fails in the quantum domain (see
French 2006).

Identity Over Time,0.7627384662628174,0.5294299721717834,"

Irving Copi once defined the problem of identity through time by
noting that the following two statements both seem true but, on the
assumption that there is change, appear to be inconsistent: 

If a changing thing really changes, there can't literally be one
and the same thing before and after the change.
However, if there isn't literally one and the same thing before
and after the change, then no thing has really undergone any
change.


Traditionally, this puzzle has been solved in various ways. Aristotle,
for example, distinguished between “accidental” and
“essential” changes. Accidental changes are ones that
don't result in a change in an objects' identity after the change,
such as when a house is painted, or one's hair turns gray, etc.
Aristotle thought of these as changes in the accidental properties of
a thing. Essential changes, by contrast, are those which don't
preserve the identity of the object when it changes, such as when a
house burns to the ground and becomes ashes, or when someone dies.
Armed with these distinctions, Aristotle would then say that, in the
case of accidental changes, (1) is false—a changing thing can
really change one of its “accidental properties” and yet
literally remain one and the same thing before and after the
change.

Of course, this solution to the puzzle depends on there being a
coherent distinction between accidental and essential changes, and
between accidental and essential properties. Some philosophers find
this distinction problematic and have developed other solutions that
don't require this distinction. In what follows, we discuss these
solutions to the puzzle, along with other puzzles that arise when
considering the identity of objects over time.

Personal Identity,0.7468425631523132,0.5327542424201965,"


Personal identity deals with philosophical questions that arise about
ourselves by virtue of our being people (or, as lawyers and
philosophers like to say, persons). This contrasts with
questions about ourselves that arise by virtue of our being living
things, conscious beings, material objects, or the like. Many of these
questions occur to nearly all of us now and again: What am I? When did
I begin? What will happen to me when I die? Others are more
abstruse. Personal identity has been discussed since the origins of
Western philosophy, and most major figures have had something to say
about it.  (There is also a rich literature on the topic in Eastern
philosophy, which I am not competent to discuss; Collins 1982 and
Jinpa 2002 are useful sources.)
Personal identity is sometimes discussed under the protean
term self.  And ‘self’ does sometimes mean
‘person’.  But it often means something different: some
sort of immaterial subject of consciousness, for instance (as in the
phrase ‘the myth of the self’).  The term is often used
without any clear meaning at all.  This entry will avoid it.


We will first survey the main questions of personal identity. Most of

Relative Identity,0.7640179395675659,0.5360912680625916,"


Identity is often said to be a relation each thing bears to itself and
to no other thing (e.g., Zalabardo 2000). This characterization is
clearly circular (“no other thing”) and paradoxical too,
unless the notion of “each thing” is qualified. More satisfactory
(though partial) characterizations are available and the idea that such
a relation of absolute identity exists is commonplace. Some, however,
deny that a relation of absolute identity exists. Identity, they say,
is relative: It is possible for objects \(x\) and \(y\) to be
the same \(F\) and yet not the same \(G\), (where
\(F\) and \(G\) are predicates representing kinds of things
(apples, ships, passengers) rather than merely properties of things
(colors, shapes)). In such a case ‘same’ cannot mean
absolute identity. For example, the same person might be two different
passengers, since one person may be counted twice as a passenger. If to
say that \(x\) and \(y\) are the same person is to say that
\(x\) and \(y\) are persons and are (absolutely) identical,
and to say that \(x\) and \(y\) are different passengers is
to say that \(x\) and \(y\) are passengers and are
(absolutely) distinct, we have a contradiction. Others maintain that
while there are such cases of “relative identity,” there is also such a
thing as absolute identity. According to this view, identity comes in
two forms: trivial or absolute and nontrivial or relative (Gupta
1980). These maverick views present a serious challenge to the
received, absolutist doctrine of identity. In the first place, cases
such as the passenger/person case are more difficult to dismiss than
might be supposed (but see below, §3). Secondly, the standard view
of identity is troubled by many persistent puzzles and problems, some
of recent and some of ancient origin. The relative identity alternative
sheds considerable light on these problems even if it does not promise
a resolution of them all. 



A word about notation. In what follows, lower case italic letters
‘\(x\)’, ‘\(y\)’, etc., are used
informally either as variables (bound or free) or as (place-holders
for) individual constants. The context should make clear which usage is
in play. Occasionally, for emphasis or in deference to logical
tradition, other expressions for individual constants are employed.
Also, the use/mention distinction is not strictly observed; but again
the context should resolve any ambiguity.

Transworld Identity,0.809138834476471,0.5817884802818298,"

The notion of transworld identity—‘identity across
possible worlds’—is the notion that the same object exists
in more than one possible world (with the actual world treated as one
of the possible worlds). It therefore has its home in a
‘possible-worlds’ framework for analysing, or at least
paraphrasing, statements about what is possible or necessary.

The subject of transworld identity has been highly contentious, even
among philosophers who accept the legitimacy of talk of possible
worlds. Opinions range from the view that the notion of an identity
that holds between objects in distinct possible worlds is so
problematic as to be unacceptable, to the view that the notion is
utterly innocuous, and no more problematic than the uncontroversial
claim that individuals could have existed with somewhat different
properties. Matters are complicated by the fact that an important
rival to ‘transworld identity’ has been proposed: David
Lewis’s counterpart theory, which replaces the claim that an
individual exists in more than one possible world with the claim that
although each individual exists in one world only, it has counterparts
in other worlds, where the counterpart relation (based on similarity)
does not have the logic of identity. Thus much discussion in this area
has concerned the comparative merits of the transworld identity and
counterpart-theoretic accounts as interpretations, within a
possible-worlds framework, of statements of what is possible and
necessary for particular individuals.

are identical to states and processes of the brain. Strictly speaking,
it need not hold that the mind is identical to the brain. Idiomatically
we do use ‘She has a good mind’ and ‘She has a good
brain’ interchangeably but we would hardly say ‘Her mind
weighs fifty ounces’. Here I take identifying mind and brain as
being a matter of identifying processes and perhaps states of the mind
and brain. Consider an experience of pain, or of seeing something, or
of having a mental image. The identity theory of mind is to the effect
that these experiences just are brain processes, not merely
correlated with brain processes. 


Some philosophers hold that though experiences are brain processes
they nevertheless have fundamentally non-physical, psychical,
properties, sometimes called ‘qualia’. Here I shall take
the identity theory as denying the existence of such irreducible
non-physical properties. Some identity theorists give a behaviouristic
analysis of mental states, such as beliefs and desires, but
others, sometimes called ‘central state materialists’, say
that mental states are actual brain states. Identity theorists often
describe themselves as ‘materialists’ but
‘physicalists’ may be a better word. That is, one might be
a materialist about mind but nevertheless hold that there are entities
referred to in physics that are not happily described as
‘material’.


In taking the identity theory (in its various forms) as a species of
physicalism, I should say that this is an ontological, not a
translational physicalism. It would be absurd to try to translate
sentences containing the word ‘brain’ or the word
‘sensation’ into sentences about electrons, protons and so
on. Nor can we so translate sentences containing the word
‘tree’. After all ‘tree’ is largely learned
ostensively, and is not even part of botanical classification. If we
were small enough a dandelion might count as a tree. Nevertheless a
physicalist could say that trees are complicated physical mechanisms.
The physicalist will deny strong emergence in the sense of some
philosophers, such as Samuel Alexander and possibly C.D. Broad . The
latter remarked (Broad 1937) that as far as was known at that time the
properties of common salt cannot be deduced from the properties of
sodium in isolation and of chlorine in isolation. (He put it too
epistemologically: chaos theory shows that even in a deterministic
theory physical consequences can outrun predictability.) Of course the
physicalist will not deny the harmless sense of ""emergence"" in which an
apparatus is not just a jumble of its parts (Smart 1981).

Law and Ideology,0.4280748665332794,0.8055734634399414,"


If law is a system of enforceable rules governing social relations
and legislated by a political system, it might seem obvious that law is
connected to ideology. Ideology refers, in a general sense, to a system
of political ideas, and law and politics seem inextricably intertwined.
Just as ideologies are dotted across the political spectrum, so too are
legal systems. Thus we speak of both legal systems and ideologies as
liberal, fascist, communist, and so on, and most people probably assume
that a law is the legal expression of a political ideology. One would
expect the practice and activity of law to be shaped by people's
political beliefs, so law might seem to emanate from ideology in a
straightforward and uncontroversial way.


However, the connection between law and ideology is both complex and
contentious. This is because of the diversity of definitions of
ideology, and the various ways in which ideology might be related to
law. Moreover, whilst the observation about law's link with ideology
might seem a sociological commonplace, the link between law and
ideology is more often made in a critical spirit, in order to impugn
law.


At issue is an understanding of ideology as a source of
manipulation. Law as ideology directs its subjects in ways that are not
transparent to the subjects themselves; law, on this view, cloaks
power. The ideal of law, in contrast, involves a set of institutions
that regulate or restrain power with reference to norms of justice.
Thus the presence of the ideological in law must, in some sense,
compromise law's integrity. Not only is the view of law as ideology at
odds with a lot of mainstream thinking about law, it seems difficult to
reconcile with the central philosophical positions on the nature of
law, e.g. a positivist conception of law as a set of formal rules, or a
natural law conception where law is identified with moral
principles.

Idiolects,0.7618381381034851,0.6769307255744934,"

For the purposes of this entry an idiolect is a language the
linguistic (i. e. syntactic, phonological, referential, etc.)
properties of which can be exhaustively specified in terms of the
intrinsic properties of some single individual, the person whose
idiolect it is. The force of “intrinsic” is to exclude
essential reference to features of the person’s wider
environment, and in particular to their linguistic community.

Some hold that idiolects in this sense do not exist or that the notion
is useless or incoherent, but are nonetheless happy to use the word
“idiolect” to describe a person’s partial grasp of,
or their pattern of deviance from, a language that is irreducibly
social in nature. The substantial debate, here, is not over how to
define a word. It turns, rather, on whether an idiolectal perspective
on language is to be preferred to a non-idiolectal one. Someone taking
an idiolectal perspective on language treats idiolects (in something
like the first sense) as having ontological or investigative priority
over social languages, conceiving of the latter as nothing but
more-or-less overlapping idiolects. Someone taking a non-idiolectal
perspective will see social languages as ontologically distinct from
and prior to the individual idiolects of those who speak them. At
issue, then, is what we should take languages to be.

The terms of the debate are not quite as simple as this implies. There
is scope, for example, for a spectrum of views. Perhaps we should be
idiolectal when thinking about language acquisition but not when
thinking about the reference of proper names. Perhaps too we should
recognize two kinds of linguistic content, only one of
which—narrow content—is best thought of in idiolectal
terms. Moreover, even someone taking a strongly idiolectal stance will
want to qualify the definition of “idiolect” given
above—by tying its properties to the person at a specified time,
in a specified social setting, or on a specified occasion, for
example, or by treating the idiolect as belonging not to a concrete
individual speaker, replete with a suite of performance errors, but to
a person who is in some respects an idealization and an
abstraction.

Several important debates feature talk of languages that are more
idiolectal than social. Some are considered in detail in other entries
(see the entries on
 the language of thought hypothesis,
 private language, and
 externalism about mental content).
 This entry will concentrate instead on one extremely influential
non-idiolectal view (Lewis’s account of languages as
conventions, Section 2, which also discusses Davidson’s
anti-conventionalism) and one extremely influential idiolectal view
(Chomsky’s notion of an I-language, Section 3). The entry begins
in Section 1 with some general remarks about the ontology of
languages.

Mental Imagery,0.8076061010360718,0.4324235320091248,"


Mental imagery (varieties of which are sometimes colloquially refered
to as “visualizing,” “seeing in the mind's 
eye,” “hearing in the head,” “imagining the 
feel of,” etc.) is quasi-perceptual experience; it 
resembles perceptual experience, but occurs in the absence of the 
appropriate external stimuli. It is also generally understood to bear
intentionality (i.e., mental images are always images 
of something or other), and thereby to function as a form of
mental representation. Traditionally, visual mental imagery,
the most discussed variety, was thought to be caused by the presence 
of picture-like representations (mental images) in the mind,
soul, or brain, but this is no longer universally accepted.


Very often, imagery experiences are understood by their subjects as 
echoes, copies, or reconstructions of actual perceptual experiences 
from their past; at other times they may seem to anticipate possible,
often desired or feared, future experiences. Thus imagery has often 
been believed to play a very large, even pivotal, role in both memory
(Yates, 1966; Paivio, 1986) and motivation (McMahon, 1973). It is 
also commonly believed to be centrally involved in visuo-spatial 
reasoning and inventive or creative thought. Indeed, according to a 
long dominant philosophical tradition, it plays a crucial role in 
all thought processes, and provides the semantic grounding 
for language. However, in the 20th century vigorous objections were 
raised against this tradition, and it was widely repudiated. More recently,
it has once again begun to find a few defenders.

Imagination,0.799397349357605,0.38060882687568665,"

To imagine something is to form a particular sort of mental
representation of that thing. Imagining is typically distinguished from
mental states such as perceiving, remembering and
believing in that imagining S does not require (that
the subject consider) S to be or have been the case, whereas
the contrasting states do. It is distinguished from mental states such
as desiring or anticipating in that
imagining S does not require that the subject wish or expect
S to be the case, whereas the contrasting states do. It is
also sometimes distinguished from mental states such
as conceiving and supposing, on the grounds that
imagining S requires some sort of quasi-sensory or positive
representation of S, whereas the contrasting states do
not.


Contemporary philosophical discussions of the imagination have been
primarily focused on three sets of topics. Work in philosophy of mind
and philosophy of psychology has explored a cluster of issues
concerning the phenomenology and cognitive architecture of imagination,
examining the ways that imagination differs from and resembles other
mental states both phenomenologically and functionally, and
investigating the roles that imagination may play in the understanding
of self and others, and in the representation of past, future and
counterfactual scenarios. Work in aesthetics has focused on issues
related to imaginative engagement with fictional characters and events,
identifying and offering resolutions to a number of (apparent)
paradoxes. And work in modal epistemology has focused on the extent to
which imaginability—and its cousin conceivability—can
serve as guides to possibility.


Because of the breadth of the topic, this entry focuses exclusively on
contemporary discussions of imagination in the Anglo-American
philosophical tradition. (For an overview of historical discussions of
imagination, see the sections on
 pre-twentieth century
and

Immigration,0.44207215309143066,0.6773328185081482,"


There are a variety of important issues surrounding the morality of
immigration, including difficult questions regarding the definition
and moral status of refugees, the circumstances (if any) in which it
is permissible to use guest workers, what obligations a rich country
incurs when it actively recruits skilled workers from a poor state,
the rights of irregular migrants, and whether there are any
limitations on the selection criteria a country may use in deciding
among applicants for immigration. This entry addresses each of these

Philosophy of Immunology,0.9492769241333008,0.5378389954566956,"

Immunology comprises a multifaceted research agenda that has developed
around the clinical challenges of host defense, transplantation,
autoimmunity, tumor immunology, and allergy. The physiological
processes mediating these clinical problems designate the immune
system, which, in turn, is understood in terms of establishing and
maintaining organismal identity. While immunology as a science has been defined as
the “science of self/nonself discrimination” (Golub and
Green 1991), from a philosophical point of view, immunology
is the science concerned with those mechanisms defining the identity
of the organism. This more expansive definition allows for conceiving
immune processes in their broadest biological context, namely, in
addition to defensive and restorative processes, the immune system
also may be understood as engaged in information processing and
cognition; active exchange with the environment to allow for benign
intercourse; and tolerance for symbiotic relationships constitutive of
an organism conceived as a complex holobiont. Thus two general
orientations vie for dominance: (1) the traditional biomedical concern
with host defense emphasizes the insularity of the organism and
immunity in service to its protection; and (2) immunity in its full
ecological context—internal and external—mediates the
organism’s dynamic identity in dialectical exchange with its
environment. In either case, cognition—its models,
metaphors, and organization—serves as the central issue
pertinent to philosophical considerations of biological identity,
individuality, organism, and agency.

Impartiality,0.5191676616668701,0.6769455075263977,"

Impartiality is sometimes treated by philosophers as if it were
equivalent to moral impartiality. Or, at the very least, the
former word is often used, without the qualifying adjective
‘moral’, even when it is the particularly moral concept
that is intended. This is misleading, since impartiality in its
broadest sense is best understood as a formal notion, while moral
impartiality in particular is a substantive concept – and one
concerning which there is considerable dispute. This entry will be
predominantly concerned with moral impartiality – the sort of
impartiality, that is, that commonly features in normative moral and
political theories. However, we will begin by addressing the broader,

Implicature,0.7658575177192688,0.7376031279563904,"
 “Implicature” denotes either (i) the act of meaning or
implying one thing by saying something else, or (ii) the object of
that act.  Implicatures can be part of sentence meaning or dependent
on conversational context, and can be conventional (in different
senses) or unconventional.  Figures of speech such as metaphor, irony,
and understatement provide familiar examples. Implicature serves a
variety of goals beyond communication: maintaining good social
relations, misleading without lying, style, and verbal efficiency.
Knowledge of common forms of implicature is acquired along with one's
native language at an early age.  Conversational implicatures have
become one of the principal subjects of pragmatics. An important
conceptual and methodological issue in semantics is how to distinguish
senses and entailments from conventional conversational implicatures.
A related issue is the degree to which sentence meaning determines
what is said. Implicature has been invoked for a variety of purposes,
from defending controversial semantic claims in philosophy to
explaining lexical gaps in linguistics. H. P. Grice, who coined the
term “implicature,” and classified the phenomenon,
developed an influential theory to explain and predict conversational
implicatures, and describe how they arise and are understood. The
Cooperative Principle and associated maxims play a central
role. Neo-Gricean theories have modified Grice's principles to some
extent, and Relevance theories replace them with a principle of
communicative efficiency. The problems for such principle-based
theories include overgeneration, lack of determinacy, clashes, and the
fact that speakers often have other goals.  An alternative approach
emphasizes that implicatures can be explained and predicted in all the
ways intentions and conventions can be.

Optimality-Theoretic and Game-Theoretic Approaches to Implicature,0.7644445896148682,0.7536096572875977,"


Linguistic pragmatics studies the context-dependent use and interpretation of
expressions.  Perhaps the most important notion in pragmatics is Grice's
(1967) conversational implicature. It is based on the
insight that by means of general principles of rational cooperative behavior
we can communicate more with the use of a sentence than the
conventional semantic meaning associated with it. Grice has argued,
for instance, that the exclusive interpretation of
‘or’—according to which we infer from ‘John or Mary
came’ that John and Mary didn't come both—is not due to the
semantic meaning of ‘or’ but should be accounted for by a theory
of conversational implicature. In this particular example,—a typical
example of a so-called Quantity implicature—the hearer's implication is
taken to follow from the fact that the speaker could have used a contrasting,
and informatively stronger expression, but chose not to. Other implicatures
may follow from what the  hearer thinks that the speaker takes to be normal
states of affairs, i.e., stereotypical interpretations. For both types of
implicatures, the hearer's (pragmatic) interpretation of an expression
involves what he takes to be the speaker's reason for using this expression.
But obviously, this speaker's reason must involve assumptions about the
hearer's reasoning as well.


In this entry we will discuss formal accounts of conversational implicatures
that explicitly take into account the interactive reasoning of speaker and
hearer (e.g., what speaker and hearer believe about each other, the relevant
aspects of the context of utterance etc.) and that aim to reductively explain
conversational implicature as the result of goal-oriented, economically
optimized language use.

Impossible Worlds,0.8089330792427063,0.6083453297615051,"

According to
 David Hume,
 the impossible cannot be conceived.
 Moritz Schlick
 claimed that the logically impossible, such as an explicit
inconsistency, is simply unthinkable. Yet
 Hegel
 complained that it is “one of the fundamental prejudices of
logic as hitherto understood” that “the contradictory
cannot be imagined or thought” (Hegel 1931: 430). On this
approach, our representational capabilities are not limited to the
possible: we are able to conceive, describe, and sometimes even
believe, impossibilities.

This entry is about impossibilities. In order to read it fruitfully,
you might also want to consult the entry on
 possible worlds.
 Many accounts of impossible worlds are best understood against the
background of possible worlds theories — although symmetries and
similarities can sometimes break down in important respects. (We will
see one in
 section 4
 below.) You might also want to look at the entry on
 modal logic
 to grasp some basic notions of worlds semantics.

We commonly speak of things being impossible in a relative
sense. If you are stuck in a traffic jam in Paris Montparnasse at 2
PM, and your flight is leaving from airport Charles De Gaulle at 2:30
PM, you may moan: “There is no way that I can make it to the
airport in time”. What you mean is that, given the timing, the
means of transport available, and other circumstances, it is
impossible for you to reach the airport in time. It is not absolutely
impossible: if you had Star Trek’s transporter, you could make it.

This entry is about worlds that are not possible, with
“possible” understood in an unrestricted sense. Start with
the intuitive idea of the totality of possible worlds, which capture
all and only the genuine possibilities. The worlds we are interested
in are not in there. These worlds are often called logically
impossible worlds, as logical laws such as the Law of
Non-Contradiction or the Law of Excluded Middle are assumed to be the
most general and topic-neutral: they are supposed to hold at all
possible worlds. From now on, we are talking of impossible worlds
simpliciter, meaning worlds that are not possible with
respect to an unrestricted notion of possibility, however this is
further characterized.

A look at the rapidly growing literature on impossible worlds (see
Nolan 2013 for a survey) presents us with a number of definitions.
These can be reduced to four main items:

Impossible Ways: just as possible worlds are often introduced
intuitively by characterising them as ways things could have been, so
are impossible worlds often characterized as ways things could not
have been. The initial insight is that not everything is possible,
that is, some things just (absolutely) cannot happen. Anything that
just can’t happen must be an absolute impossibility; and these
ways the world just couldn’t be are impossible worlds (see e.g.
Salmon 1984; Yagisawa 1988; Restall 1997; Beall & van Fraassen
2003). 

Logic Violators: another definition has it that impossible
worlds are worlds where the laws of logic fail. This depends on what
we take the laws of logic to be. Given some logic L, an impossible
world with respect to the L-laws is one in which some of those laws
fail to hold (see e.g. Priest 2001, Chapter 9). An impossible world in
this second sense will be an impossible world in the first sense,
given that logical necessity is unrestricted. But not vice versa.
Suppose it’s metaphysically necessary that the Mona Lisa (if it
exists) was painted by da Vinci. Then a world in which the Mona Lisa
was painted by Neil Buchanan on Art Attack is an impossible
world in the first sense but not in the second, for it does not
violate any logical law.

Classical Logic Violators: another definition has it that
impossible worlds are worlds where the laws of classical
logic fail (see e.g. Priest 1997a). A world complying with
 intuitionistic logic,
 and where instances of the Law of Excluded Middle fail, will be
impossible in the third sense.

Contradiction-Realizers: a still more specific definition has
it that an impossible world is a world where sentences of the form
\(A\) and \(\neg A\) hold, against the Law of
Non-Contradiction (see e.g. Lycan 1994). Impossible worlds of the
fourth kind will be impossible in the third sense, but not vice versa.
Our intuitionistic world above will have the Law of Non-Contradiction
hold unrestrictedly: it will be impossible in the third, but not in
the fourth sense.

The Incommensurability of Scientific Theories,0.8945236206054688,0.4963824450969696,"

The term ‘incommensurable’ means ‘to have no common
measure’. The idea has its origins in Ancient Greek mathematics,
where it meant no common measure between magnitudes. For example,
there is no common measure between the lengths of the side and the
diagonal of a square. Today, such incommensurable relations are
represented by irrational numbers. The metaphorical application of
this mathematical notion specifically to the relation between
successive scientific theories became controversial in 1962 after it
was popularised by two influential philosophers of science: Thomas
Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend. They appeared to be challenging the
rationality of natural science and were often considered to be among
“the worst enemies of science” (Theocharis and Psimopoulos
1987, 596; cf. Preston et al. 2000). Since 1962, the
incommensurability of scientific theories has been a widely discussed,
controversial idea that was instrumental in the historical turn in the
philosophy of science and the establishment of the sociology of
science as a professional discipline.

Values, such as liberty and equality, are sometimes said to be
incommensurable in the sense that their value cannot be reduced to a
common measure. The possibility of value incommensurability is thought
to raise deep questions about practical reason and rational choice as
well as related questions concerning topics as diverse as
akrasia, moral dilemmas, the plausibility of utilitarianism,
and the foundations of liberalism. This entry outlines answers in the
contemporary literature to these questions, starting with questions

Arguments for Incompatibilism,0.5830704569816589,0.7672510743141174,"

We believe that we have free will and this belief is so firmly
entrenched in our daily lives that it is almost impossible to take
seriously the thought that it might be mistaken. We deliberate and
make choices, for instance, and in so doing we assume that there is
more than one choice we can make, more than one action we are able to
perform. When we look back and regret a foolish choice, or blame
ourselves for not doing something we should have done, we assume that
we could have chosen and done otherwise. When we look forward and make
plans for the future, we assume that we have at least some control
over our actions and the course of our lives; we think it is at least
sometimes up to us what we choose and try to do. 

Determinism is a highly general claim about the universe: very
roughly, that everything that happens, including everything you choose
and do, is determined by facts about the past together with the laws.
Determinism isn’t part of common sense, and it is not easy to
take seriously the thought that it might, for all we know, be true.
The incompatibilist believes that if determinism turned out to be
true, our belief that we have free will would be false. The
compatibilist denies that the truth of determinism would have this
drastic consequence. According to the compatibilist, the truth of
determinism is compatible with the truth of our belief that we have
free will. The philosophical problem of free will and determinism is
the problem of deciding who is right: the compatibilist or the
incompatibilist.

Much of the philosophical interest in the free will/determinism
problem is motivated by concerns about moral responsibility because,
it is generally agreed, having free will is a necessary condition of
being morally responsible. So if determinism precludes free will, it
also precludes moral responsibility. But it’s important to
distinguish questions about free will (whether we have it, what it
amounts to, whether it is compatible with determinism, whether it is
compatible with other things we believe true) from questions about
moral responsibility. Someone might believe that we have free will and
that free will is compatible with determinism while also believing,
for other reasons, that no one is ever morally responsible. And
someone might believe that we don’t have free will (because of
determinism or something else) while also believing, against
conventional wisdom, that we are nevertheless morally responsible.
What one believes about determinism and moral responsibility will
depend, in large part, on what one believes about various matters
within the scope of ethics rather than metaphysics. Among other
things, it will depend on what one takes moral responsibility to be
(P. Strawson 1962; G. Strawson 1986, 1994; Watson 2004). For these
reasons it is important not to conflate the question of the
compatibility of free will and determinism with the question of
whether moral responsibility is compatible with determinism.

It must be acknowledged that a change in definitions has crept into
the literature, and many contemporary theorists understand
‘compatibilism’ and ‘incompatibilism’ as
claims about moral responsibility (or “moral freedom” or
the freedom that “grounds” or “explains” moral
responsibility”) rather than claims about free will (Pereboom
1995, 2001, 2014. See Vihvelin 2011 for discussion). This entry will
not follow that usage.

This encyclopedia entry is about the free will/determinism problem;
more specifically, it is about arguments for the claim that free will
is incompatible with determinism. Since so much of the contemporary
free will literature is dominated by concerns about moral
responsibility, some of the arguments considered will be arguments for
the thesis that if determinism is true, we are never morally
responsible because we never satisfy the “freedom
requirement” for being morally responsible for our actions. But
the focus, in this entry, will be on the question of whether free will
(or acting with free will) is compatible with determinism.

The Concept of Emotion in Classical Indian Philosophy,0.4769409596920013,0.32790619134902954,"

Most discussions of the term “emotion” in classical Indian
literature take place in the context the rasa theory of Indian
aesthetics. The word rasa can mean juice, sap, essence,
condiment or even flavour and refers to the different sentiments
invoked by a work of art, for example a piece of music. However, this
entry focuses on the emotions in Indian philosophical thinking outside
of the realm of aesthetics. While there is no equivalent for the term
“emotion” in Sanskrit, the concept nevertheless plays an
important role in Indian philosophy. Terms used in Sanskrit texts
include vedanā (feeling) and bhāva
(feeling) as well as names of individual emotions, such as
rāga (love, attraction), dveṣa (hatred,
aversion), harṣa (joy), bhaya (fear) and
śoka (sorrow). One of the reasons why emotions are
philosophically interesting in India and the West is their
relationship with the mental phenomenon of
vijñāna or jñāna which is
translated as “cognition”. The relationship between
emotion and cognition is important for any account of reason and
rationality. While the importance of the emotions for rational
deliberation and decision-making has been acknowledged in recent
discussions in the philosophy of mind, the history of Western
philosophy contains many views, for example those of Plato, Aristotle,
and the Stoics, which emphasize the dangerous and destructive role of
the emotions. At the heart of these views lies a division of our
mental lives into cognitions and feelings. Cognitions are
representational thoughts. They are often regarded as rational because
they are capable of representing the external world and therefore they
provide us with access to the external world, based on the best
available evidence. So, according to this view of rationality, when I
think that there is a book on the table, based on my available
evidence, and there really is one, then my thought is rational.
However, if I am hallucinating that there is a book on the table, my
thought that there is a book might also be rational because the
available evidence points towards this thought. In order to make sure
that our thoughts represent reality correctly, we require an account
of what counts as good evidence, which is one of the main foci of
epistemology in Indian and Western philosophy. Nevertheless,
cognitions derive their status as thoughts capable of rationality from
the fact that they have objects which represent the external world. By
contrast, feelings are some of the non-representational attitudes one
can have towards the objects of the representations of our thoughts.
For example, when a person thinks about her daughters, she has a
cognition which represents her daughters. The objects of her thought
are her daughters and her thought picks them out among various objects
and subjects in the world. There are several ways in which these
objects can be picked out: one can simply have the thought that one
has two daughters or one's thought can be “coloured” with
love and affection. This “colouring” of thought is often
regarded as an affect. Together with the thought, it accounts for an
emotion. So, the emotion of love, for example, is the thought of the
object of love plus an affect. The affect is non-representational and
regarded as a “mere” feeling.

The reason why many philosophers regard the emotions as an obstacle to
rational thought is the influence of the non-representational feeling.
The fact that feelings do not seem to have objects means, according to
some views, that they can interfere with rational thought. According
to these views, rational thought, which is representational and
therefore object-directed, is subject to disturbing interferences from
the feelings. The feelings themselves, however, are non-rational
because they arise due to some physical imbalance in the body, for
example through an imbalance of the various “humours”.
This imbalance can negatively influence rational thought. An example
is the person who acts against her better judgment because she is in
the grip of some feeling. This is of course also the basis for the
term “passion” as something that we “suffer”,
which was discussed by many philosophers in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, e.g. Descartes, Spinoza and Hume. Since rational
thought is an ideal for many philosophers and the feelings can
interfere with this ideal, the natural consequence seems to be to
advocate for the extinction or at least the control of the feelings
and, as a consequence, of the emotions. This is what many philosophers
throughout the history of philosophy have done, most notably of course
the Stoics. While they often recognize that the emotions contain a
cognitive, and therefore potentially rational, element, they try to
uncover this element by advocating its separation from the affect. Of
course, if the affect were to be purged from the emotion, the
resulting cognition would cease to be an emotion.

There is a parallel between this Western view and a prejudice that
attaches to Indian philosophy. The prejudice is that Indian
philosophy, because of its soteriological nature with its emphasis on
the attainment of liberation, is about freeing the mind from feelings
and emotions because they constitute an attachment to the world. While
this is true of some schools of Indian philosophy, it is by no means a
justified account of Indian philosophy as a whole. The different
positions within Indian philosophy on this topic are more complex, as
is the case with regard to Western philosophy. This article introduces
some of the main positions regarding the emotions and their relation
to cognitions in Indian philosophy. The sections of the article
roughly correspond to the division into philosophical schools in
classical Indian philosophy. Since arguably Buddhist philosophers have
paid more attention to those phenomena that Western philosophers would
classify as emotions than other Indian philosophers, the Buddhist
account of the emotions will be discussed in more detail than the
other accounts.

Language and Testimony in Classical Indian Philosophy,0.7466892004013062,0.6567172408103943,"

Speculations about the nature and function of language in India can be
traced to its earliest period. These speculations are multi-faceted in
that one detects many different strands of thought regarding language.
Some of these speculations are about what one may call the principle
of language, but others are about specific languages or specific uses
of these languages. One sees speculations regarding the creation of
language as well as the role of language in the creation of the
universe. Language appears in relation to gods as well as humans, and
occupies the entire width of a spectrum from being a divinity herself
to being a means used by gods to create and control the world, and
ultimately to being a means in the hands of the human beings to
achieve their own religious as well as mundane purposes. Gradually, a
whole range of questions are raised about all these various aspects of
language in the evolving religious and philosophical traditions in
India, traditions which shared some common conceptions, but thrived in
full-blooded disagreements on major issues. Such disagreements relate
to the ontological nature of language, its communicative role, the
nature of meaning, and more specifically the nature of word-meaning
and sentence-meaning. On the other hand, certain manifestations of
language, whether in the form of specific languages like Sanskrit or
particular scriptural texts like the Vedas, became topics of
contestation between various philosophical and religious traditions.
Finally, one must mention the epistemic role and value of language,
its ability or inability to provide veridical knowledge about the
world. In what follows, I intend to provide a brief account of these
diverse developments in ancient, classical and medieval India. (For an
approximate chronology of Indian philosophers, see the
 supplement.)

The Literal-Nonliteral Distinction in Classical Indian Philosophy,0.7461349368095398,0.6573047637939453,"

Indian thinkers demarcate the boundaries between literal and
non-literal meaning early in their history. They do so within
different intellectual genres, each broadly philosophical, but with
varying emphases. Within the grammatical genre, Yāska’s
Semantic Explanation (Nirukta), an early (perhaps
6th century to 3rd century BCE) etymological
treatise recognizes the difference between ordinary (laukika)
and metaphorical language (upamā). This text, possibly
pre-dating the renowned Sanskrit grammarian Pāṇini (ca
4th century BCE), employs etymological analysis in order to
ascertain the meanings of unfamiliar terms used in the Vedas, a
collection of texts including religious hymns, poetry, and rituals. In
portions of the Vedas called Upaniṣads, widely recognized as
proto-philosophical, the limits of language are made explicit:
ordinary speech cannot characterize ultimate reality, though
figurative language can hint at it. These early texts focus on topics
which would give rise to three intellectual traditions: Grammar,
Philosophy, and Aesthetics. (Capital letters distinguish the schools
of thought from their subject matter.)

Two of the three textual traditions, Grammar and Philosophy, are
identifiable by their relationship to early “root” texts
which form the basis of later commentarial reflection. Within Grammar,
the aforementioned Yāska, as well as Pāṇini,
Patañjali (ca 2nd century CE), and Bhartṛhari
(ca 5th century CE), are a few of the most crucial thinkers
whose reflections—on the structure of Sanskrit in particular,
and by way of Sanskrit, language in general—informed
philosophical reflection on meaning. For instance,
Pāṇini’s analysis of the morphology, syntax, and
semantics of Sanskrit, in his Eight Chapters
(Aṣṭādhyāyī) continues to be cited
by philosophers a thousand years later. The literal/non-literal
distinction is a topic as well for the various philosophical schools,
each one known as a darśana, roughly a
“viewpoint”. Both those who accept the Vedas as
authoritative and those who do not address the distinction in the
context of testimony and theories of reference. Among the former,
Vedic-accepting thinkers, this article primarily treats the Nyāya
and Mīmāṃsā philosophical traditions, and of the
Veda-denying, the Buddhists and the Jainas. Finally, the tradition
here called Aesthetics (alaṃkāra) is really
focused more narrowly on the aesthetics of poetry and
drama—especially the courtly poetry known as
kāvya. It encompasses topics studied in rhetoric,
poetics, and aesthetics within Western traditions.
Alaṃkāra, despite meaning
“embellishment” or “ornamentation”, (in
reference to figures of speech), studies the psychology of utterances,
their ensuing emotional states in audiences, and their logical or
semantic structures. Until the highly influential Light on
Suggestion (Dhvanyāloka) of Ānandavardhana (ca
9th century CE), aesthetic theory was primarily focused on
taxonomies of figuration, but after Ānandavardhana, it drew on
philosophical work, in particular Mīmāṃsā, to
theorize about meaning itself.

What follows lays out the conceptual space for Indian theorizing about
literal and non-literal meaning by way of each of these three textual
traditions. Since the article’s structure is topical rather than
historical, a chronology of major figures is appended to help orient
readers. The focus of the article is the period demarcated roughly
from 200 CE to 1300 CE, often characterized as the Classical Period of
Indian philosophy.

The exercise of reasoning and the practice of argument are recorded in
the early texts of India. Preoccupation with the nature of reason and
argument occurs in the earliest philosophical texts, where their
treatment is intimately connected with questions of ontology,
epistemology and dialectics. These questions continued to be at the
center of philosophical discussion through the classical and medieval
period of Indian philosophy. This article will chronicle the answers
Indian philosophers gave to these questions during the pre-classical

Naturalism in Classical Indian Philosophy,0.762721598148346,0.3133871853351593,"

As a philosophical theory, naturalism aligns philosophy with science
and the natural world—rejecting the supernatural. There are a
variety of naturalisms, including: ontological naturalism, which holds
that reality contains no supernatural entities; methodological
naturalism, which holds that philosophical inquiry should be
consistent with scientific method; and moral naturalism, which
typically holds that there are moral facts and that such facts are
part of the natural world.

Classical Indian philosophers do not call themselves naturalists, but
different naturalistic traits are easily detectable in different
schools. The validity of this claim is tied to the concept of nature
admitted in different systems, which alone determines the boundary
between natural and supernatural. This article, therefore, first
discusses two different theories of nature and in the light of that
constructs arguments for ontological naturalism, methodological
naturalism and moral naturalism by drawing on the writings of
classical Indian philosophers. Naturalistic traits are not uniformly
present in all systems: a single system of philosophy might uphold
naturalism from one perspective and non-naturalism from another. The
Naiyāyikas for example, have shown marked preference for
naturalism in epistemology while in linguistic theory they are staunch
conventionalists; the Advaita Vedantins on the other hand, are
non-naturalists in their ontology but their epistemology can be looked
upon as naturalistic. A moral naturalism is shared by most Indian
philosophical systems. However, in importing these labels from Western
philosophy to the classical Indian philosophical systems, one needs to
exercise caution because the concepts of nature, science, scientific
method, etc. do not smoothly converge in the two theoretical
traditions.

Perceptual Experience and Concepts in Classical Indian Philosophy,0.749881386756897,0.3307115137577057,"


Classical Indian Philosophy accepts perception
(pratyakṣa), or perceptual experience, as the primary
means of knowledge (pramāṇa). Perception
(pratyakṣa) is etymologically rooted in the
sense-faculty or the sense-organ (akṣa) and can be
translated as sensory awareness, while pramāṇa, on
the other hand, is derived from knowledge (pramā) and,
literally means ‘the instrument in the act of
knowing’. However, the standard interpretation of perception
accepted by classical Indian philosophers, barring the Buddhists and
the Vedāntins, is that it is a cognition arising within the
self—the knowing subject—from mental operations following
a sense-object contact. It, therefore, is neither an instrument in the
act of knowing, nor a mere sensory awareness. Definitions of
perception from various classical Indian philosophy schools are given
in section 2 below.

The same is true of concepts. There is no one agreed notion or
definition of concept understood as the meaning of a general term in
Classical Indian Philosophy. Rather, we have a variety of views
ranging from robust realism about concepts as real properties,
essences or universals to extreme nominalism which admits only of
unique particulars with versions of conceptualism in between. The
robust realist position is defended by the
Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika and Mīmāṃsā
schools, the nominalist by the Buddhist schools and the conceptualist
by the Vedāntins and Jainas. I will not be discussing the
conceptualist position or their arguments here because ultimately this
position ends up collapsing into a version of realism or
nominalism.

Methodological Individualism,0.6591314673423767,0.7332624197006226,"


This doctrine was introduced as a methodological precept for the
social sciences by Max Weber, most importantly in the first chapter of
Economy and Society (1922). It amounts to the claim
that social phenomena must be explained by showing how they result
from individual actions, which in turn must be explained through
reference to the intentional states that motivate the individual
actors. It involves, in other words, a commitment to the primacy of
what Talcott Parsons would later call “the action frame of
reference” (Parsons 1937: 43–51) in social-scientific
explanation. It is also sometimes described as the claim that
explanations of “macro” social phenomena must be supplied
with “micro” foundations, ones that specify an
action-theoretic mechanism (Alexander, 1987).


A contrast is often drawn, following J.W.N. Watkins (1952a), between
methodological individualism and methodological holism. This is
usually tendentious, since there are very few social scientists who
describe themselves as methodological holists. There are, however,
forms of social-scientific explanation with more active adherents that
methodological individualism precludes or downgrades. These include,
most importantly, functionalism, many types of sociobiology,
“memetics” or evolutionary cultural explanation,
psychoanalytic and “depth hermeneutic” methods, and any
form of explanatory generalization grounded in purely statistical
analysis.


Defenders of methodological individualism generally claim that it is
an innocent doctrine, devoid of any political or ideological
content. Weber himself cautioned that “it is a tremendous
misunderstanding to think that an ‘individualistic’
method should involve what is in any conceivable sense an
individualistic system of values” (Weber 1922:
18). Nevertheless, the doctrine of methodological individualism became
embroiled in a number of highly politicized debates during the
20th century, largely because it was often invoked as a way
of discrediting historical materialism.  There were two distinct
rounds of controversy on this score. The first occurred primarily
during the 1950s, in response to the work of Friedrich von Hayek and
Karl Popper. The second round occurred during the 1980s, in
response to Jon Elster, this time as part of critical debates within
the movement known as “analytical Marxism.” During the
latter period, methodological individualism became widely associated
with what many called “rational choice imperialism.”

The Problem of Induction,0.713850736618042,0.6561217308044434,"

[Editor's Note: The following new entry by Leah Henderson replaces the
 former entry
 on this topic by the previous author.]


We generally think that the observations we make are able to justify
some expectations or predictions about observations we have not yet
made, as well as general claims that go beyond the observed. For
example, the observation that bread of a certain appearance has thus
far been nourishing seems to justify the expectation that the next
similar piece of bread I eat will also be nourishing, as well as the
claim that bread of this sort is generally nourishing. Such inferences
from the observed to the unobserved, or to general laws, are known as
“inductive inferences”.

The original source of what has become known as the “problem of
induction” is in Book 1, part iii, section 6 of A Treatise
of Human Nature by David Hume, published in 1739. In 1748, Hume
gave a shorter version of the argument in Section iv of An enquiry
concerning human understanding. Throughout this article we will
give references to the Treatise as “T”, and the
Enquiry as “E”.

Hume asks on what grounds we come to our beliefs about the unobserved
on the basis of inductive inferences. He presents an argument in the
form of a dilemma which appears to rule out the possibility of any
reasoning from the premises to the conclusion of an inductive
inference. There are, he says, two possible types of arguments,
“demonstrative” and “probable”, but neither
will serve. A demonstrative argument produces the wrong kind of
conclusion, and a probable argument would be circular. Therefore, for
Hume, the problem remains of how to explain why we form any
conclusions that go beyond the past instances of which we have had
experience (T. 1.3.6.10). Hume stresses that he is not disputing that
we do draw such inferences. The challenge, as he sees it, is to
understand the “foundation” of the inference—the
“logic” or “process of argument” that it is
based upon (E. 4.2.21). The problem of meeting this challenge, while
evading Hume’s argument against the possibility of doing so, has
become known as “the problem of induction”.

Hume’s argument is one of the most famous in philosophy. A
number of philosophers have attempted solutions to the problem, but a
significant number have embraced his conclusion that it is insoluble.
There is also a wide spectrum of opinion on the significance of the
problem. Some have argued that Hume’s argument does not
establish any far-reaching skeptical conclusion, either because it was
never intended to, or because the argument is in some way
misformulated. Yet many have regarded it as one of the most profound
philosophical challenges imaginable since it seems to call into
question the justification of one of the most fundamental ways in
which we form knowledge. Bertrand Russell, for example, expressed the
view that if Hume’s problem cannot be solved, “there is no
intellectual difference between sanity and insanity” (Russell
1946: 699).

In this article, we will first examine Hume’s own argument,
provide a reconstruction of it, and then survey different responses to
the problem which it poses.

Inductive Logic,0.7771456837654114,0.8387559652328491,"

An inductive logic is a logic of evidential support. In a deductive
logic, the premises of a valid deductive argument logically
entail the conclusion, where logical entailment means that every logically possible state of affairs that makes the premises true must
make the conclusion truth as well. Thus, the premises of a valid deductive argument provide total support for the conclusion. An inductive logic extends this idea to weaker arguments. In a good inductive argument, the truth of the premises provides some degree of support for the truth of the conclusion, where this degree-of-support might be measured via some numerical scale. By analogy with the notion of deductive entailment, the notion of inductive degree-of-support might mean something like this: among the logically possible states of affairs that make the premises true, the conclusion must be true in (at least) proportion r of them—where r is some numerical measure of the support strength.

If a logic of good inductive arguments is to be of any
real value, the measure of support it articulates should be up to the task. Presumably, the logic should at least satisfy the following condition: 


Criterion of Adequacy (CoA):

The logic should make it likely (as a matter of logic) that as evidence accumulates,
the total body of true evidence claims will eventually come to indicate, via the logic’s measure of
support, that false hypotheses are probably false and that true
hypotheses are probably true.


The CoA stated here may strike some readers as surprisingly strong. Given a specific logic of evidential support, how might it be shown to satisfy such a condition?
Section 4 will show precisely how this condition is satisfied by the logic of evidential support articulated in Sections 1 through 3 of this article.

This article will focus on the kind of the approach to inductive logic
most widely studied by epistemologists and logicians in recent years.
This approach employs conditional probability functions to represent
measures of the degree to which evidence statements support
hypotheses. Presumably, hypotheses should be empirically evaluated
based on what they say (or imply) about the likelihood that evidence claims will be true. A
straightforward theorem of probability theory, called Bayes’
Theorem, articulates the way in which what hypotheses say about the likelihoods of evidence claims influences the degree to which hypotheses are
supported by those evidence claims. Thus, this approach to the logic
of evidential support is often called a Bayesian Inductive
Logic or a Bayesian Confirmation Theory. This article will first provide a detailed explication of a Bayesian approach to inductive logic. It will
then examine the extent to which this logic may pass muster as
an adequate logic of evidential support for hypotheses. In particular,
we will see how such a logic may be shown to satisfy the Criterion of
Adequacy stated above.

Sections 1 through 3 present all of the main ideas underlying the
(Bayesian) probabilistic logic of evidential support. These
three sections should suffice to provide an adequate understanding of
the subject. Section 5 extends this account to cases where the implications of
hypotheses about evidence claims (called likelihoods)
are vague or imprecise. After reading Sections 1 through 3, the reader may safely skip directly to Section 5, bypassing the rather technical account in Section 4 of how how the CoA is satisfied.

Section 4
 is for the more advanced reader who wants an understanding of how
this logic may bring about convergence to the true hypothesis
as evidence accumulates. This result shows that the Criterion of
Adequacy is indeed satisfied—that as evidence accumulates, false
hypotheses will very probably come to have evidential support values
(as measured by their posterior probabilities) that approach
0; and as this happens, a true hypothesis may very probably acquire
evidential support values (as measured by its posterior
probability) that approaches 1.

Space and Time: Inertial Frames,0.8682113289833069,0.3630137443542481,"


A “frame of reference” is a standard relative to which
motion and rest may be measured; any set of points or objects that are
at rest relative to one another enables us, in principle, to describe
the relative motions of bodies. A frame of reference is therefore a
purely kinematical device, for the geometrical description of motion
without regard to the masses or forces involved. A dynamical account of
motion leads to the idea of an “inertial frame,” or a
reference frame relative to which motions have distinguished dynamical
properties. For that reason an inertial frame has to be understood as a
spatial reference frame together with some means of measuring time, so
that uniform motions can be distinguished from accelerated motions. The
laws of Newtonian dynamics provide a simple definition: an inertial
frame is a reference-frame with a time-scale, relative to which the
motion of a body not subject to forces is always rectilinear and
uniform, accelerations are always proportional to and in the direction
of applied forces, and applied forces are always met with equal and
opposite reactions. It follows that, in an inertial frame, the center
of mass of a system of bodies is always at rest or in uniform motion.
It also follows that any other frame of reference moving uniformly
relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame. For example,
in Newtonian celestial mechanics, taking the “fixed stars”
as a frame of reference, we can determine an (approximately) inertial
frame whose center is the center of mass of the solar system; relative
to this frame, every acceleration of every planet can be accounted for
(approximately) as a gravitational interaction with some other planet
in accord with Newton's laws of motion.


This appears to be a simple and straightforward concept. By
inquiring more narrowly into its origins and meaning, however, we begin
to understand why it has been an ongoing subject of philosophical
concern. It originated in a profound philosophical consideration of the
principles of relativity and invariance in the context of Newtonian
mechanics. Further reflections on it, in different theoretical
contexts, had extraordinary consequences for 20th-century
theories of space and time.

Infinite Regress Arguments,0.7398197650909424,0.5818238854408264,"


An infinite regress is a series of appropriately related elements with
a first member but no last member, where each element leads to or
generates the next in some 
 sense.[1]
 An infinite regress argument is an
argument that makes appeal to an infinite regress. Usually such
arguments take the form of objections to a theory, with the fact that
the theory implies an infinite regress being taken to be
objectionable.


There are two ways in which a theory’s resulting in an infinite
regress can form an objection to that theory. The regress might reveal
a bad feature of the theory—a feature that is not the regress
itself, that we have independent reason to think is a reason to reject
the theory. Or the fact that the theory results in the infinite
regress might itself be taken to be a reason to reject the theory. The
former cases are the easier ones, since in those cases we do not have
to make a judgment as to whether the regress itself is objectionable,
we only need to ask about the feature of the theory that the regress
reveals. We will look at cases like this first, before turning to
cases where the regress itself might be seen as a reason to reject a
theory.


Many, many infinite regress arguments have been given throughout the
history of philosophy, and we will not attempt here to survey even the
most important of them. Rather, the aim will be to shed light on the
kinds of regress argument that may be encountered, and the different
considerations that arise in different cases. As we proceed, however,
we will see some particularly famous regress arguments as

 regresses.)[2]

For centuries, the study of logic has inspired the idea that its
methods might be harnessed in efforts to understand and improve
thinking, reasoning, and argument as they occur in real life contexts:
in public discussion and debate; in education and intellectual
exchange; in interpersonal relations; and in law, medicine and other
professions. Informal logic is the attempt to build a logic suited to
this purpose. It combines the study of argument, evidence, proof and
justification with an instrumental outlook which emphasizes its
usefulness in the analysis of real life arguing.

Informal logic is usually understood narrowly, as a contemporary field
of study which emerged in the last half century, when many
philosophers and logicians turned their attention to the analysis,
evaluation and improvement of real life argument. This contemporary
endeavor can be understood much more broadly, as the continuation of
many older attempts by philosophers and others who have (since ancient
times) proposed methods for understanding and assessing actual
(“real life,” “everyday”) arguments.

Contributions to informal logic often address specific aspects of
scientific, legal, and other specialized instances of reasoning, but
the overriding aim has been a general account of argument that can be
used to explain and evaluate it in contexts of reflection, inquiry,
social and political discussion, news, blogs and editorials,
advertising, corporate and institutional communication, and
interpersonal exchange.

In developing an account of argument, informal logicians have studied
inference and a broad range of other relevant topics. The latter
include, to take only a few examples: competing accounts of the nature
of argument; criteria for argument evaluation; argument schemes;
fallacies; deductive, inductive, and conductive models of inference;
rhetorical and dialectical approaches to argument; onus and burden of
proof; the empirical study of argument; argument diagramming (or
“mapping”); cognitive biases; the history of argument
analysis; the role of emotion in argument; and the rules that govern
argumentative exchange in different communicative contexts. 

Hansen 2011 provides a survey of the methods of informal logic which
emphasizes different approaches to the study and evaluation of
inference in informal argument. Blair 2015 identifies two key tasks
for informal logic: the attempt to develop ways to identify (and
“extract”) arguments from natural language discourse and
the attempt to develop methods and guidelines for assessing their
cogency.

Philosophy of Information deals with the philosophical analysis of the
notion of information both from a historical and a systematic
perspective. With the emergence of empiricist theory of knowledge in
early modern philosophy, the development of various mathematical
theories of information in the 20th century and the rise of
information technology, the concept of ‘information’ has
conquered a central place in the sciences and in society. This
interest also led to the emergence of a separate branch of philosophy
that analyzes information in all its guises (Adriaans and van Benthem
2008a,b; Lenski 2010; Floridi 2002, 2011). Information has become a
central category in both the sciences and the humanities and the
reflection on information influences a broad range of philosophical
disciplines varying from logic (Dretske 1981; van Benthem en van Rooij
2003; van Benthem 2006) to ethics (Floridi 1999) and esthetics
(Schmidhuber 1997a; Adriaans 2008) to ontology (Zuse 1969; Wheeler
1990; Schmidhuber 1997b; Wolfram 2002; Hutter 2010).

The term ‘information’ in colloquial speech is currently
predominantly used as an abstract mass-noun used to denote any amount
of data, code or text that is stored, sent, received or manipulated in
any medium. The detailed history of both the term
‘information’ and the various concepts that come with it
is complex and for the larger part still has to be written (Seiffert
1968; Schnelle 1976; Capurro 1978, 2009; Capurro and Hjørland
2003). The exact meaning of the term ‘information’ varies
in different philosophical traditions and its colloquial use varies
geographically and over different pragmatic contexts. Although an
analysis of the notion of information has been a theme in Western
philosophy from its early inception, the explicit analysis of
information as a philosophical concept is recent, and dates back to
the second half of the 20th century. Historically the study of the
concept of information can be understood as an effort to make the
extensive properties of human knowledge measurable. In the 20th
century various proposals for formalization of concepts of information
were made:


Fisher information: the amount of information that
an observable random variable X carries about an unknown
parameter θ upon which the probability of X
depends (Fisher 1925).
Shannon information: the entropy, H, of a
discrete random variable X is a measure of the amount of
uncertainty associated with the value of X (Shannon 1948;
Shannon & Weaver 1949).
Kolmogorov complexity: the information in a binary
string x is the length of the shortest program p that
produces x on a reference universal Turing machine U
(Solomonoff 1960, 1964a,b, 1997; Kolmogorov 1965; Chaitin 1969,
1987).
Quantum Information: The qubit is a generalization
of the classical bit and is described by a quantum state in a two-state
quantum-mechanical system, which is formally equivalent to a
two-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers (Von Neumann
1955; Redei & Stoeltzner 2001).
Information as a state of an agent: the formal
logical treatment of notions like knowledge and belief was initiated
by Hintikka (1962, 1973). Dretske (1981) and van Benthem & van
Rooij (2003) studied these notions in the context of information
theory, cf.  van Rooij (2004) on questions and answers, or Parikh
& Ramanujam (2003) on general messaging. Also Dunn seems to have
this notion in mind when he defines information as “what is left
of knowledge when one takes away believe, justification and
truth” (Dunn 2001 pg. 423, 2008).
Semantic Information: Bar-Hillel and Carnap
developed a theory of semantic Information (1953). Floridi (2002,
2003, 2011) defines semantic information as well-formed, meaningful
and truthful data. Formal entropy based definitions of information
(Fisher, Shannon, Quantum, Kolmogorov) do not imply wellformedness or
truthfulness.


The first four concepts are quantitative, the last two
qualitative. These proposals can roughly be classified in terms of the
nature of the definiens: Probability in the case of Fisher and Shannon
Information, computation in the case of Kolmogorov complexity, quantum
mechanics in the case of quantum information, true beliefs as the core
concept of Semantic Information, whereas information states of agents
seem to correlate with the formal notion propositions that not
necessarily have to be true. The philosophical interpretation of the
definiendum ‘Information’ naturally depends on the views
one holds about the definiens.  Until recently the possibility of a
unification of these theories was generally doubted (Adriaans and van
Benthem 2008a) but in the past decade conversions and reductions
between various formal models have been studied (Cover and Thomas
2006; Grünwald and Vitányi 2008; Bais and Farmer
2008). The situation that seems to emerge is not unlike the concept of
energy: there are various formal sub-theories about energy (kinetic,
potential, electrical, chemical, nuclear) with well-defined
transformations between them. Apart from that, the term
‘energy’ is used loosely in colloquial speech. There is no
consensus about the exact nature of the field of philosophy of
information. Some authors like Floridi (2002, 2003, 2011) present
‘Philosophy of Information’ as a completely new
development with a capacity to revolutionize philosophy per se. Others
(Adriaans and van Benthem 2008a; Lenski 2010) see it more as a
technical discipline with deep roots in the history of philosophy and
consequences for various disciplines like methodology, epistemology
and ethics.

Logic and Information,0.8554688692092896,0.8421041965484619,"

At their most basic, logic is the study of consequence, and
information is a commodity. Given this, the interrelationship between
logic and information will centre on the informational consequences of
logical actions or operations conceived broadly. The explicit
inclusion of the notion of information as an object of
logical study is a recent development. It was by the beginning of the
present century that a sizable body of existing technical and
philosophical work (with precursors that can be traced back to the
1930s) coalesced into the new emerging field of logic and information
(see Dunn 2001). This entry is organised thematically, rather than
chronologically. We survey major logical approaches to the study of
information, as well as informational understandings of logics
themselves. We proceed via three interrelated and complementary
stances: information-as-range, information-as-correlation, and
information-as-code. 

The core intuition motivating the Information-as-range
stance, is that an
informational state may be characterised by the range of possibilities
or configurations that are compatible with the information available
at that state. Acquiring new information corresponds to a reduction of
that range, thus reducing uncertainty about the actual configuration
of affairs. With this understanding, the setting of possible-world
semantics for epistemic modal logics proves to be rewarding for the
study of various semantic aspects of information. A prominent
phenomenon here is information update, which may occur in
both individual and social settings, due to the interaction between
both agents and their environment via different types of epistemic
actions. We will see that an epistemic action is any action that
facilitates the flow of information, hence we will return to epistemic
actions themselves throughout.

The Information-as-correlation stance focuses
on information flow as it is licensed within structured systems formed
by systematically correlated components. For example: the number of
rings of a tree trunk can give you information about the time when the
tree was born, in virtue of certain regularities of nature that
‘connect’ the past and present of trees. Central themes of
this stance include the aboutness, situatedness, and accessibility
of information in structured information environments. 

The key concern of the third stance, Information-as-code,
is the syntax-like
structure of information pieces (their encoding) and the
inference and computation processes that are licensed by
virtue (among other things) of that structure. A most natural logical
setting to study these informational aspects is the algebraic proof
theory underpinned by a range of substructural logics.
Substructural logics have always been a natural home for informational
analysis, and the recent developments in the area enrich the
information-as-code stance. 

The three stances are by no means incompatible, but neither are they
necessarily reducible to each other. This will be expanded on later in
the entry, and some further topics of research will be illustrated,
but for a preview of how the three stances can live together, take the
case of a structured information system composed of several parts.
Firstly, the correlations between the parts naturally allow for
‘information flow’ in the sense of the
information-as-correlation stance. Secondly, they also give rise to a
local ranges of possibilities, since the local information available
at one part will be compatible with a certain range of global states
of the system. Thirdly, the combinatorial, syntax-like,
proof-theoretical aspects of information can be brought to this
setting in various ways. One of them is treating the correlational
flow of information as a sort of combinatorial system by which local
information states are combined in syntactic-like ways, fitting a
particular interpretation of substructural logic. One could also add
code-like-structure to the modelling explicitly, for example by
assigning local deductive calculi to either the components or local
states of the system. We begin however with information as
range

Quantum entanglement is a physical resource, like energy, associated
with the peculiar nonclassical correlations that are possible between
separated quantum systems. Entanglement can be measured, transformed,
and purified. A pair of quantum systems in an entangled state can be
used as a quantum information channel to perform computational and
cryptographic tasks that are impossible for classical systems. The
general study of the information-processing capabilities of quantum
systems is the subject of quantum information theory.

Semantic Conceptions of Information,0.8599288463592529,0.6161161065101624,"


“I love information upon all subjects that come in my way, and
especially upon those that are most important.” Thus boldly
declares Euphranor, one of the defenders of Christian faith in
Berkeley's Alciphron (Dialogue 1, Section 5, Paragraph 6/10,
see Berkeley [1732]). Evidently, information has been an object of
philosophical desire for some time, well before the computer
revolution, Internet or the dot.com pandemonium (see for example Dunn
[2001] and Adams [2003]). Yet what does Euphranor love, exactly?
What is information? The question has received many answers
in different fields. Unsurprisingly, several surveys do not even
converge on a single, unified definition of information (see for
example Braman [1989], Losee [1997], Machlup and Mansfield [1983],
Debons and Cameron [1975], Larson and Debons [1983]).


Information is notoriously a polymorphic phenomenon and a polysemantic
concept so, as an explicandum, it can be associated with
several explanations, depending on the level of abstraction adopted
and the cluster of requirements and desiderata orientating a
theory. The reader may wish to keep this in mind while reading this
entry, where some schematic simplifications and interpretative
decisions will be inevitable. Claude E. Shannon, for one, was very
cautious:



The word ‘information’ has been given different meanings
by various writers in the general field of information theory. It is
likely that at least a number of these will prove sufficiently useful
in certain applications to deserve further study and permanent
recognition. It is hardly to be expected that a single concept of
information would satisfactorily account for the numerous possible
applications of this general field. (italics added).  (Shannon
[1993], p. 180)


Thus, following Shannon, Weaver [1949] supported a tripartite analysis
of information in terms of



(1) technical problems concerning the quantification of information
and dealt with by Shannon's theory


(2) semantic problems relating to meaning and truth; and
 

(3) what he called “influential” problems concerning
the impact and effectiveness of information on human behaviour, which
he thought had to play an equally important role.



And these are only some early examples of the problems raised by any
analysis of information.


Indeed, the plethora of different analyses can be confusing.
Complaints about misunderstandings and misuses of the very idea of
information are frequently expressed, even if to no apparent avail.
Sayre [1976], for example, criticised the “laxity in use of the
term ‘information’” in Armstrong [1968] (see now
Armstrong [1993]) and in Dennett [1969] (see now Dennett [1986]),
despite appreciating several other aspects of their work. More
recently, Harms [1998] pointed out similar confusions in Chalmers
[1996], who 




seems to think that the information theoretic notion of information
[see section 3, my addition] is a matter of what possible states there
are, and how they are related or structured […] rather than of
how probabilities are distributed among them. (p. 480).




In order to try to avoid similar pitfalls, this entry has been
organised into four sections. Section 1 attempts to draw a map of the
main senses in which one may speak of semantic information,
and does so by relying on the analysis of the concept of data
(depicted in Figure 1 below). Sometimes the several concepts of
information organised in the map can be variously coupled
together. This should not be taken as necessarily a sign of confusion,
for in some philosophers it may be the result of an intentional
bridging. The map is not exhaustive and it is there mainly in order to
avoid some obvious pitfalls and to narrow the scope of this article,
which otherwise could easily turn into a short version of the
Encyclopedia Britannica. Its schematism is only a starting point for
further research and the reader interested in knowing more may wish to
consult Floridi [2011] and Adriaans and van Benthem [2008].



After this initial orientation, Section 2 provides a brief
introduction to information theory, that is, to the mathematical
theory of communication (MTC). MTC deserves a space of its own because
it is the quantitative approach to the analysis of information that
has been most influential among several philosophers. It provides the
necessary background to understand several contemporary theories of
semantic information, especially Bar-Hillel and Carnap [1953], Dretske
[1981].


Section 3 analyses information as semantic content. Section 4 focuses
entirely on the philosophical understanding of semantic information,
what Euphranor really loves.


The reader must also be warned that an initial account of semantic
information as meaningful data will be used as yardstick to
outline other approaches. Unfortunately, even such a minimalist account
is open to disagreement. In favour of this approach one may say that at
least it is less controversial than others. Of course, a conceptual
analysis must start somewhere. This often means adopting some working
definition of the object under scrutiny. But it is not this commonplace
that one needs to emphasize here. The difficulty is rather more
daunting. Philosophical work on the concept of (semantic) information
is still at that lamentable stage when disagreement affects even the
way in which the problems themselves are provisionally phrased and
framed. Nothing comparable to the well-polished nature of the Gettier
problem is yet available, for example. So the “you are
here” signal provided in this article might be placed elsewhere
by other philosophers. The whole purpose is to put the concept of
semantic information firmly on the philosophical map. Further
adjustments will then become possible.

Information Technology and Moral Values,0.5486767292022705,0.872687041759491,"

Information technology is now ubiquitous in the lives of people
across the globe. These technologies take many forms such as
personal computers, smart phones, the internet, web and mobile phone
applications, digital assistants, and cloud computing. In fact
the list is growing constantly and new forms of these technologies are
working their way into every aspect of daily life. In some cases,
such as can be seen in massive multiplayer online games (see
 section 2.1.1 below), these technologies are
 even opening up new ways of
interacting with each other.  Information technology at its
basic level is technology that records, communicates, synthesizes or
organizes information. Information can be understood as any
useful data, instructions, or meaningful message content. The
word literally means to “give form to” or to shape
one's thoughts. So a basic type of information technology
might be the proverbial string tied around one's finger to remind
or inform you that you have some specific task to accomplish
today. Here the string stands in for a more complex proposition
such as “buy groceries before you come home.”  The
string itself is not the information, it merely symbolizes the
information and therefore this symbol must be correctly interpreted for
it to be useful. Which raises the question, what is information
itself?

 Unfortunately there is not a completely satisfying and
philosophically rigorous definition available, though there are at
least two very good starting points. For those troubled by the
ontological questions regarding information, we might want to simply
focus on the symbols and define information as any meaningfully ordered
set of symbols.   This move can be very useful and
mathematicians and engineers prefer to focus on this aspect of
information, which is called “syntax” and leave
the meaningfulness of information or its “semantics” for
others to figure out. Claude E. Shannon working at Bell Labs
produced a landmark mathematical theory of communication (1948), where
he took his experiences in cryptography and telephone technologies and
worked out a mathematical formulation describing how syntactical
information can be turned into a signal that is transmitted in such a
way as to mitigate noise or other extraneous signals which can then be
decoded by the desired receiver of the message (Shannon 1948; Shannon
and Weaver 1949). The concepts described by Shannon, along with
additional important innovations made by others who are too many to
list, explain the way that information technology works, but we still
have the deeper issue to resolve if we want to thoroughly trace the
impact of information technologies on moral values.  


The second starting point is a bit more deeply philosophical in
nature. Here we begin with the claim that information either
constitutes or is closely correlated with what constitutes our
existence and the existence of everything around us.  This means
that information plays an ontological role in the manner in which the
universe operates.  A standpoint such as this would place
information at the center of concern for philosophy and this idea has
given rise to the new fields of Information Philosophy and Information
Ethics. Philosophy of Information will not be addressed in detail
here but the interested reader can begin with Floridi (2010b, 2011b) for
an introduction.   Some of the most important aspects of
Information Ethics will be outlined in more detail below.


Every action we take leaves a trail of information that could be
recorded and stored for future use. For instance, you might use the
simple technology of keeping a detailed diary listing all the things
you did and thought during the day. But today you could augment that
with even more detail gathered with advanced information technologies
some examples include; all of your economic transactions, a GPS
generated plot of where you traveled, a list of all the web addresses
you visited and the details of each search you initiated online, a
listing of all your vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate,
all of your dietary intakes for the day, and many other examples can
be imagined. As you go through this thought experiment you begin to
see the complex trail of data that you generate each and every day and
how that same data might be collected and stored though the use of
information technologies. Here we can begin to see how information
technology can impact moral values. As this data gathering becomes
more automated and ever-present, we must ask who is in control of this
data, what is to be done with it, and who will insure its
accuracy. For instance, which bits of information should be made
public, which held private, and which should be allowed to become the
property of third parties like corporations?  Questions of the
production, access and control of information will be at the heart of
moral challenges surrounding the use of information technology. 


One might argue that this situation is no different from the moral
issues revolving around the production, access and control of any basic
necessity of life. But there is one major difference, if one
party controls the access of some natural resource, then that by
necessity excludes others from using it. This is not necessarily
so with digital information, it is non-exclusory, meaning we can all at
least theoretically possess the same digital information because
copying it from one digital source to another does not require
eliminating the previous copy. Since there is no physical
obstacle to the spread of all information, then there remain only
appeals to morality, or economic justice, which might prevent
distributing certain forms of information. Therefore,
understanding the role of moral values in information technology is
indispensable to the design and use of these technologies (Johnson
1985; Moor 1985; Nissenbaum 1998; Spinello 2001).   It
should be noted that this entry will not directly address the
phenomenological approach to the ethics of information technology since
there is a detailed entry on this subject available
(see entry on 
Phenomenological Approaches to Ethics and Information Technology).

Human beings value their privacy and the protection of their
personal sphere of life. They value some control over who knows what
about them. They certainly do not want their personal information to
be accessible to just anyone at any time. But recent advances in
information technology threaten privacy and have reduced the amount of
control over personal data and open up the possibility of a range of
negative consequences as a result of access to personal data. The
21st century has become the century of Big Data and
advanced Information Technology allows for the storage and processing
of exabytes of data. The revelations of Edward Snowden have
demonstrated that these worries are real and that the technical
capabilities to collect, store and search large quantities of data
concerning telephone conversations, internet searches and electronic
payment are now in place and are routinely used by government
agencies. For business firms, personal data about customers and
potential customers are now also a key asset. At the same time, the
meaning and value of privacy remains the subject of considerable
controversy. The combination of increasing power of new technology and
the declining clarity and agreement on privacy give rise to problems
concerning law, policy and ethics. The focus of this article is on
exploring the relationship between information technology (IT) and
privacy. We will both illustrate the specific threats that IT and
innovations in IT pose for privacy, and indicate how
IT itself might be able to overcome these privacy concerns by
being developed in a ‘privacy-sensitive way’. We will also
discuss the role of emerging technologies in the debate, and account
for the way in which moral debates are themselves affected by IT.

ontologist and aesthetician. A student of Edmund Husserl's from the
Göttingen period, Ingarden was a realist phenomenologist who spent

transcendental idealism. As preparatory work for narrowing down
possible solutions to the realism/idealism problem, Ingarden developed
ontological studies unmatched in scope and detail, distinguishing
different kinds of dependence and different modes of being. He is best

ontology of the work of art and the status of aesthetic values, and is

The Distinction Between Innate and Acquired Characteristics,0.9926761388778688,0.5152014493942261,"


The idea that some characteristics of an organism are explained by
the organism's intrinsic nature, whilst others reflect the
influence of the environment is an ancient one. It has even been argued
that this distinction is itself part of the evolved psychology of the
human species. The distinction played an important role in the history
of philosophy as the locus of the dispute between Rationalism and
Empiricism discussed in
 another entry
 in this encyclopedia. This entry, however, focuses on
twentieth-century accounts of the innate/acquired distinction. These
accounts have for the most part been inspired by the sciences of mind
and behaviour.


Innateness must be clearly distinguished from heritability, at least
in the scientific sense of that term. The idea that heritability scores
measure the degree to which a characteristic is innate is a vulgar
fallacy. Heritability is a statistical measure of the sources of
individual differences in a population. While heritability itself is
well understood, its relationship to the innate/acquired distinction
remains highly controversial.


The belief that a trait is innate is today commonly expressed by
saying it is ‘in the genes’. But genes play an essential
role in the production of every trait. Consequently, it will not do to
say simply that innate traits are ‘caused by genes’ whilst
acquired traits are ‘caused by the environment’. Any
relationship between genetic causation and the innate/acquired
distinction will be far more complex than this.


Recent philosophical analyses of the innate/acquired distinction can
be classified into four types. The first identifies innate traits with
those characteristic of an entire species and identifies acquired
traits with those that vary between populations and individuals. A
second type of analysis identifies innate traits with those that can be
explained by natural selection. The third, and currently the most
influential, identifies innate traits with those produced by a
particular patterns of interaction between genes and environment. A
fourth, quite different, type of analysis suggests that labelling a
trait ‘innate’ is a way to indicate that it lies outside
the domain of psychology.


Finally, there is a tradition of scepticism about the
innate/acquired distinction. Sceptics argue that it confounds a number
of distinctions that are better kept separate, or, perhaps
equivalently, that there is no one property of a trait that corresponds
to its being innate.

Nativism and Empiricism are rival approaches to questions about the
origins of knowledge.  Roughly speaking, Nativists hold that important
elements of our understanding of the world are innate, that they are
part of our initial condition, and thus do not have to be learned from
experience.  Empiricists deny this, claiming that all knowledge is
based in experience.  Different Nativist and Empiricist views spell
out the details in different ways, depending on which elements of our
knowledge are at issue, what counts as understanding, what is meant by
the initial condition, how learning is to be understood, what it is
for knowledge to be based in experience, and so on.  There continues
to be lively philosophical debate about whether there is any
satisfactory general account of what it is for something to be innate
(for a review of some recent work see Gross & Rey 2012).  The
Nativist views discussed here differ in many respects, but all share
the broad commitments of the approach.  It should be noted that the
commonplace opposition of Empiricism to Rationalism reflects back on
17th and 18th century philosophical debates in which Nativism was a
central plank in the Rationalist position.  The contemporary Nativist
views we consider here are independent of most of the broader Rationalist
commitments (see the entry on 
 rationalism vs. empiricism), but we note some important and often-ignored connections in section 3.3 of this entry. 
 Although it is misleading, it is not uncommon for the
terms ‘Nativism’ and ‘Rationalism’ to be used
interchangeably (see the entry on the
  historical controversies surrounding innateness).

Up until the 1950s, there were no active research programs that were
looking for the innate factors in knowledge and cognition that had
been hypothesized and argued for by Nativist thinkers since Plato. It
was widely agreed that the centuries-old battles between Empiricists
and Nativists were over, and that the Empiricists had decisively won.
The Nativist situation was actually worse than that: innateness claims
were seen as not only wrong, but as ultimately unscientific approaches
to mind and perhaps incoherent as well.  The prevailing research
agenda for scientists and philosophers interested in how the mind
works was to show how our knowledge and abilities could be fully
accounted for on the basis of our sensory experiences and the general
learning mechanisms that operate on them. 

But a number of developments have led to a resurgence of Nativism,
beginning with Chomsky’s revolutionary work in linguistics in the
1950s and 1960s.  This entry places this resurgence in its scientific
and philosophical context, and will discuss a few important areas of
research to give a taste of the kinds of experimental approaches,
hypotheses, and theories that have been advanced. A word about the
focus of this entry. Most philosophical discussions about innateness
begin with careful analyses of the variety of meanings innateness
claims can have, consider the sorts of entities that might be at issue
in such claims (beliefs, ideas, concepts, knowledge, etc.), discuss
the epistemological standing of these innate elements, and so
on. These questions are no doubt interesting—and sometimes the
answers are interesting too—and such work has its place. But the
real action for philosophers is more in the details of the current
empirical research, and less in the philosophical bookkeeping.
Cognitive scientists are beginning to reveal some of the basic, or one
might say ‘primal’, patterns of human cognition. They are
using experimental evidence to paint a detailed picture of how we
human beings understand the world—both the physical world around
us, and ourselves and other selves that are parts of that
world. Developmental scientists are trying to figure out to what
extent and in what ways we are built by nature to arrive at these
understandings. Those we identify as Nativists accord a significant
role to our natures, and lean towards the view that we are not built
to be initially neutral about the world we encounter, in the way that
classical Empiricism would lead us to expect. This growing body of
scientific thinking is of general interest, as evidenced by the
attention of science magazines and newspapers like the NY Times. But
the character of our primal understandings and their innate bases are
intimately connected to the central concepts and questions that
philosophers have always been most interested in. Getting clear on how
we naturally think and how we come to think that way is, arguably, a
critical element in our understanding of human beings.


The entry has three main sections. In the first section,
current Nativist developments are put in recent historical context,
especially the connections between Chomsky’s linguistic
innovations and current cognitive science research. The second,
and longest section, takes up three areas of current research on
children’s early concepts and understanding—of physical
objects, number, and mind/agency—to give a sense of the type of
empirical work being conducted and to highlight some of the promising
results that are
 emerging.[1]
A third section reviews some recent work in
the study of development that is close to the Empiricist side of the
traditional divide.

The Historical Controversies Surrounding Innateness,0.6819843649864197,0.38458481431007385,"


We are as we are and we live as we do because of the interplay of
our inherent natures and the world around us. This much is
uncontroversial. But it is natural to wonder about the extent of
the contributions of the two broad factors and about the nature of the
interactions. This is where the innateness controversy
begins. In the history of philosophy, the focus of the innateness
debate has been on our intellectual lives: does our inherent nature
include any ideas, concepts, categories, knowledge, principles, etc, or
do we start out with blank cognitive slates (tabula rasa) and get all
our information and knowledge from perception. Nativists defend
some variant of the first option, while Empiricists lean towards the
second.


To modern ears this sounds like a straightforward empirical question
that can only be addressed scientifically. But even if we grant
that the philosophical controversy was to some extent
premature—like Greek speculations about the ultimate constituents
of the world—it is important to understand that the question
loomed large in philosophy not only because of its inherent interest,
but primarily because of what followed—or was thought to
follow—from the competing positions. The innateness
question was taken as a lynchpin in settling questions in morality,
religion, epistemology, metaphysics, and so on.


A survey of the philosophical career of innateness reveals that
although it is an easy doctrine to attack, it is a hard one to
kill. Innateness has been in the philosophical limelight in two
periods—each time flaring, and then receding. In the
ancient world, it played a pivotal role in Plato's philosophy,
but was excluded from the Aristotelian system that came to dominate
subsequent philosophical thinking. In the 17th and 18th century,
it was revived. It played an important role in Descartes'
theory of knowledge, Locke mounted a sustained assault against it at
the very beginning of his Essay, and Leibniz produced a detailed
rebuttal against Locke. But the Lockean Empiricist approach
carried the day, and innateness was written off as a backward and
discredited view. Nineteenth century Kantianism, although
potentially friendlier to innateness, left it on the sidelines as
philosophically irrelevant. Recently, however, prompted by Noam
Chomsky's claim that findings in linguistics vindicate Nativism
against Empiricism, innateness has made a strong comeback; it is once
again the subject of philosophical and scientific controversy.

Innateness and Language,0.7640182971954346,0.6736848950386047,"


The philosophical debate over innate ideas and their role in the 
acquisition of knowledge has a venerable history. It is thus 
surprising that very little attention was paid until early last 
century to the questions of how linguistic knowledge is 
acquired and what role, if any, innate ideas might play in that 
process.


To be sure, many theorists have recognized the crucial part played by
language in our lives, and have speculated about the (syntactic 
and/or semantic) properties of language that enable it to play that 
role. However, few had much to say about the properties of 
us in virtue of which we can learn and use a natural language. 
To the extent that philosophers before the 20th century dealt with 
language acquisition at all, they tended to see it as a product of 
our general ability to reason — an ability that makes us 
special, and that sets us apart from other animals, but that is not 
tailored for language learning in particular.


In Part 5 of the Discourse on the Method, for instance, 
Descartes identifies the ability to use language as one of two 
features distinguishing people from “machines” or 
“beasts” and speculates that even the stupidest people 
can learn a language (when not even the smartest beast can do so) 
because human beings have a “rational soul” and beasts 
“have no intelligence at all.” (Descartes 1984: 140-1.) 
Like other great philosopher-psychologists of the past, Descartes 
seems to have regarded our acquisition of concepts and knowledge 
(‘ideas’) as the main psychological mystery, taking 
language acquisition to be a relatively trivial matter in comparison;
as he puts it, albeit ironically, “it patently requires very 
little reason to be able to speak.” (1984: 140.)


All this changed in the early twentieth century, when linguists, 
psychologists, and philosophers began to look more closely at the 
phenomena of language learning and mastery. With advances in syntax 
and semantics came the realization that knowing a language was not 
merely a matter of associating words with concepts. It also crucially
involves knowledge of how to put words together, for it's 
typically sentences that we use to express our thoughts, not words in
isolation.


If that's the case, though, language mastery can be no simple matter.
Modern linguistic theories have shown that human languages are vastly
complex objects. The syntactic rules governing sentence formation and
the semantic rules governing the assignment of meanings to sentences 
and phrases are immensely complicated, yet language users apparently 
apply them hundreds or thousands of times a day, quite effortlessly 
and unconsciously. But if knowing a language is a matter of knowing 
all these obscure rules, then acquiring a language emerges as the 
monumental task of learning them all. Thus arose the 
question that has driven much of modern linguistic theory: How could 
mere children learn the myriad intricate rules that govern linguistic
expression and comprehension in their language — and learn them
solely from exposure to the language spoken around them?


Clearly, there is something very special about the brains of human 
beings that enables them to master a natural language — a feat 
usually more or less completed by age 8 or so. §2.1 of this 
article introduces the idea, most closely associated with the work of
the MIT linguist Noam Chomsky, that what is special about human 
brains is that they contain a specialized ‘language 
organ,’ an innate mental ‘module’ or 
‘faculty,’ that is dedicated to the task of mastering a 
language.


On Chomsky's view, the language faculty contains innate knowledge of 
various linguistic rules, constraints and principles; this innate 
knowledge constitutes the ‘initial state’ of the language
faculty. In interaction with one's experiences of language during 
childhood — that is, with one's exposure to what Chomsky calls 
the ‘primary linguistic data’ or 
‘pld’ (see §2.1) — it gives rise to a
new body of linguistic knowledge, namely, knowledge of a specific 
language (like Chinese or English). This ‘attained’ or 
‘final’ state of the language faculty constitutes one's 
‘linguistic competence’ and includes knowledge of the 
grammar of one's language. This knowledge, according to Chomsky, is 
essential to our ability to speak and understand a language 
(although, of course, it is not sufficient for this ability: much 
additional knowledge is brought to bear in ‘linguistic 
performance,’ that is, actual language 
 use).[1]



§§2.2-2.5 discuss the main arguments used by Chomsky and 
others to support this ‘nativist’ view that what makes 
language acquisition possible is the fact that much of our linguistic
knowledge is unlearned; it is innate or inborn, part of the initial 
state of the language 
 faculty.[2]
 Section 3 presents a number of other avenues 
of research that have been argued to bear on the innateness of 
language, and shows how recent empirical research about language 
learning and the brain may challenge the nativist position. Because 
much of this material is very new, and because my conclusions (many 
of which are tentative) are highly controversial, more references to 
the empirical literature than are normal in an encyclopedia article 
are included. The reader is encouraged to follow up on the research 
cited and assess the plausibility of linguistic nativism for him or 
herself: whether language is innate or not is, after all, an 
empirical issue.

Insolubles,0.7373615503311157,0.17517073452472687,"

The medieval name for paradoxes like the famous Liar Paradox
(“This proposition is false”) was “insolubles”
or insolubilia,
 [1]
 though besides semantic paradoxes, they included epistemic paradoxes,
e.g., “You do not know this proposition”. From the
late-twelfth century to the end of the Middle Ages and beyond, such
paradoxes were discussed at length by an enormous number of authors.
Yet, unlike twentieth century interest in the paradoxes, medieval
interest seems not to have been prompted by any sense of theoretical
“crisis”.

The history of the medieval discussions can be divided into three main
periods: (a) an early stage, from the late-twelfth century to the
1320s; (b) a period of especially intense and original work, during
roughly the second quarter of the fourteenth century; (c) a late
period, from about 1350 on. The discussion in this article will be
organized as follows:

Instrumental Rationality,0.5590228438377379,0.8036811947822571,"


Someone displays instrumentally rationality insofar as she adopts
suitable means to her ends.  Instrumental rationality, by virtually
any reckoning, is an important, and presumably indispensable, part of
practical rationality.  However, philosophers have been interested in
it for further reasons.  To take one example, it has been suggested
that instrumental rationality, or some tendency toward it, is partly
constitutive of intention, desire, or action. To take another, more
important, example, it has been argued that instrumental rationality
is not only a part, but a special part, or even the whole, of
practical rationality.  This thesis appears to threaten the
“rational authority” of morality.  It seems possible that
acting morally on some occasion might not be a suitable means to an
agent's ends.  If so, then according to this thesis, it would
not be irrational for her to refuse to act morally on such an
occasion. 
We should note two restrictions on the scope of this article.  First,
 this article focuses on contemporary discussions of the subject, apart 
from some brief discussions of Hume and Kant.  Notable omissions, for 
example, are Aristotle's discussion of the practical syllogism and his claim
 that deliberation is of means (Nicomachean Ethics, Book III, Chapter 3). 
Second, this article doesn't focus on decision theory, which some may
 view as containing, or just being, a theory of instrumental 
rationality: what means to take to achieve certain ends (the 
satisfaction of preferences, or the realization of valuable states of 
affairs) given credences, or beliefs, or information, about the 
probabilities that various means will achieve those ends.

In this article, we begin (§1) by noting a
distinction that frames the discussion that follows: very roughly, a
distinction between the question of whether some attitude is such that
an agent ought, or (more weakly) has reason, to have it, and the
question of whether that attitude rationally coheres with her other
attitudes. We first (§2) discuss the importance
of means-end relations for what one ought, or has reason, to intend:
specifically, for how reasons for ends “transmit” to
reasons for means. We then (§3) discuss
instrumental rationality understood as a norm of rational
coherence. Lastly, we consider (§4) the
“Humean” thesis that instrumental rationality is the only
kind of practical rationality.

Integrity,0.5262025594711304,0.6850135922431946,"

Integrity is one of the most important and oft-cited of virtue terms.
It is also perhaps the most puzzling. For example, while it is
sometimes used virtually synonymously with ‘moral,’ we
also at times distinguish acting morally from acting with integrity.
Persons of integrity may in fact act immorally—though they would
usually not know they are acting immorally. Thus one may acknowledge a
person to have integrity even though that person may hold what one
thinks are importantly mistaken moral views.

When used as a virtue term, ‘integrity’ refers to a
quality of a person’s character; however, there are other uses
of the term. One may speak of the integrity of a wilderness region or
an ecosystem, a computerized database, a defense system, a work of
art, and so on. When it is applied to objects, integrity refers to the
wholeness, intactness or purity of a thing—meanings that are
sometimes carried over when it is applied to people. A wilderness
region has integrity when it has not been corrupted by development or
by the side-effects of development, when it remains intact as
wilderness. A database maintains its integrity as long as it remains
uncorrupted by error; a defense system as long as it is not breached.
A musical work might be said to have integrity when its musical
structure has a certain completeness that is not intruded upon by
uncoordinated, unrelated musical ideas; that is, when it possesses a
kind of musical wholeness, intactness and purity.

Integrity is also attributed to various parts or aspects of a
person’s life. We speak of attributes such as professional,
intellectual and artistic integrity. However, the most philosophically
important sense of the term ‘integrity’ relates to general
character. Philosophers have been particularly concerned to understand
what it is for a person to exhibit integrity throughout life. What is
it to be a person of integrity? Ordinary discourse about
integrity involves two fundamental intuitions: first, that integrity
is primarily a formal relation one has to oneself, or between parts or
aspects of one’s self; and second, that integrity is connected
in an important way to acting morally, in other words, there are some
substantive or normative constraints on what it is to act with
integrity. 

How these two intuitions can be incorporated into a consistent theory
of integrity is not obvious, and most accounts of integrity tend to
focus on one of these intuitions to the detriment of the other. A
number of accounts have been advanced, the most important of them
being: (i) integrity as the integration of self; (ii) integrity as
maintenance of identity; (iii) integrity as standing for something;
(iv) integrity as moral purpose; and (v) integrity as a virtue. These
accounts are reviewed below. We then examine several issues that have
been of central concern to philosophers exploring the concept of
integrity: the relations between types of integrity, integrity and
moral theory, and integrity and social and political conditions.

Intensional Transitive Verbs,0.7991913557052612,0.6884735226631165,"


A verb is transitive iff it usually occurs with a direct
object, and in such occurrences it is said to occur
transitively. Thus ‘ate’ occurs transitively in
‘I ate the meat and left the vegetables’, but not in
‘I ate then left’ (perhaps it is not the same verb
‘left’ in these two examples, but it seems to be the same
‘ate’). A verb is intensional if the verb phrase
(VP) it forms with its complement is anomalous in at least one of
three ways: (i) substituting one expression for another that is
coreferential with it in the complement of the verb can change the
truth-value of the sentence in which the VP occurs – for
instance, you might admire Mark Twain but not Samuel Clemens, not
realizing that your pesky neighbor Sam is the famous writer
(in this case substitution of the coreferential ‘Samuel
Clemens’ for ‘Mark Twain’ in the VP ‘admire
Mark Twain’ will turn a true sentence, ‘you admire Mark
Twain’ into a false one, ‘you admire Samuel
Clemens’); (ii) the VP admits of a special
“unspecific” reading if it contains a quantifier, or a
certain type of quantifier (for examples, see section 1); and (iii)
the normal existential commitments of names and existential
quantifiers in the complement are suspended even when the embedding
sentence is negation-free (again, see section 1).


Intensional phenomena are puzzling, and worth studying, because (a)
it seems that the only way to account for language-speakers'
capacities to produce and understand sentences of their native
languages which they have never encountered before is to posit
 compositional structure
 in language and an interpretive capacity in
speakers that exploits it. But (b) the simplest ideas about what such
structure is like cannot accommodate intensionality. So we want to know
what the smallest complication is which allows for the intensional.
Investigation of intensional verbs has focussed mainly on verbs used to make
 propositional attitude reports.
These verbs take clauses rather than direct objects as their complements.
However, as we will see below, intensional transitive verbs (henceforth
ITVs) do not merely duplicate the problems raised by propositional
attitude verbs, but introduce special difficulties of their own.

Intention,0.5657666325569153,0.815200686454773,"


Philosophical perplexity about intention begins with its appearance
in three guises: intention for the future, as when I intend to complete
this entry by the end of the month; the intention with which someone
acts, as I am typing with the further intention of writing an
introductory sentence; and intentional action, as in the fact that I am
typing these words intentionally. As Elizabeth Anscombe wrote in a
similar context, ‘it is implausible to say that the word is
equivocal as it occurs in these different cases’ and from the
fact that ‘we are tempted to speak of “different
senses” of a word which is clearly not equivocal, we may infer
that we are pretty much in the dark about the character of the concept
which it represents’ (Anscombe 1963, p. 1).


The principal task of the philosophy of intention is to uncover and
describe the unity of these three forms. This project matters for
questions in the philosophy of mind, but also for ethics, where it is
involved in the doctrine of double effect, for epistemology, and most
obviously, for the nature of practical reason.


We can classify theories of intention roughly but usefully on two
axes. First, how do they find unity in the guises of intention? Do they
explain one in terms of another? Which, if any, do they treat as
primary? There is a deep opposition here between accounts that take
intention to be a mental state in terms of which we can explain
intentional action, and those that do not. Second, how do they
understand the relation between intention and evaluative thought, which
bears on the possibility of akrasia, and the relation between
intention and belief, which bears on the nature and scope of
self-knowledge? These questions arise whatever the relation between
intending and doing. Sections 1 and 2 address the first axis of
disagreement, while sections 3 to 5 primarily address the second.

Intentionality is the power of minds to be about, to represent, or to
stand for, things, properties and states of affairs. The puzzles of
intentionality lie at the interface between the philosophy of mind and
the philosophy of language. The word itself, which is of medieval
Scholastic origin, was rehabilitated by the philosopher Franz Brentano
towards the end of the nineteenth century.
‘Intentionality’ is a philosopher's word. It derives from
the Latin word intentio, which in turn derives from the
verb intendere, which means being directed towards some goal
or thing. The entry falls into eleven sections:

Collective Intentionality,0.5719485282897949,0.8288185596466064,"


Collective intentionality is the power of minds to be jointly
directed at objects, matters of fact, states of affairs, goals, or
values. Collective intentionality comes in a variety of modes,
including shared intention, joint attention, shared belief, collective
acceptance, and collective emotion. Collective intentional attitudes
permeate our everyday lives, for instance when two or more agents look
after or raise a child, campaign for a political party, or cheer for a
sports team. And these attitudes are relevant for philosophers,
theoretically minded social scientists, and anthropologists because
they play crucial roles in the constitution of the social world. In
joint attention, the world is experienced as perceptually
available for a plurality of agents. This establishes a basic sense of
common ground on which other agents may be encountered as potential
cooperators. Shared intention enables the participants to act
in that world together intentionally, in a coordinated and cooperative
fashion, and to achieve collective goals. The capacity for shared
belief provides us with a common stock of knowledge, and thus with a
background against which relevant new information which we may want to
share with others becomes salient. Collective acceptance is a
central presupposition for the creation of a language, and of a whole
world of symbols, institutions, and social status. Shared
evaluative attitudes provide us with a conception of the common
good. In virtue of this we can reason from the perspective of our
groups, and conceive of ourselves in terms of our social identities and
social roles. This again enables us to constitute group agents such as
business enterprises, universities, or political parties.




Collective intentional attitudes involve a plurality of participants
in such a way that the attitudes in question can be ascribed to
individuals as a group, or unit. The main philosophical
challenge connected with the analysis of collective intentionality is
in the tension within the expression “individuals as a
group”. It can be spelled out as a contradiction between the
following two widely accepted claims (the Central Problem): 





Collective intentionality is no simple summation, aggregate, or
distributive pattern of individual intentionality (the Irreducibility
Claim);
 Collective intentionality is had by the participating
individuals, and all the intentionality an individual has is his or her
own (the Individual Ownership Claim). 





Over the last couple of decades,
a number of theories of collective intentionality have been proposed,
pointing towards different ways to solve this tension.

Intentionality in Ancient Philosophy,0.7222129702568054,0.3780328333377838,"


Philosophical inquiry into intentionality — that feature of
beliefs, desires, and other mental states, in virtue of which they are
of or about something — begins long before recent debates about
mental content or even the work of phenomenologists towards the
beginning of the twentieth century. According to the received view,
widespread in the literature, it can be traced back past figures such
as Edmund Husserl and Franz Brentano to late medieval discussions in
the Latin West; and from these, in turn, to earlier Arabic
philosophy. But at this point, the trail is supposed to peter out.
Nothing in Greek or Roman philosophy, allegedly, corresponds.


But in fact this narrative rests on questionable assumptions. Once the
investigation is properly framed, it is clear that philosophical
interest in intentionality can be traced back to the very origins of
ancient philosophy. Intentionality is treated as involving serious
problems already in the early- to mid-fifth century B.C.E., arguably
first by Parmenides of Elea, but indisputably by sophists such as
Gorgias and Protagoras. Plato thematizes the difficulties and
discusses them at length in several dialogues. In later philosophers,
we find various theoretical solutions, including appeals to internal
representations (Aristotle), to nonexistent objects of thought (early
Stoics), and to propositions and other semantic entities (later
Stoics). The terminology of intentionality itself can be traced back,
through Augustine, to the Stoic theory of vision.

Reasons for Action: Internal vs. External,0.5534830689430237,0.7603750824928284,"


Often, when there is a reason for you to do something, it is the kind
of thing to motivate you to do it. For example, if Max and Caroline
are deciding whether to go to the Alcove for dinner, Caroline might
mention as a reason in favor, the fact that the Alcove serves onion
rings the size of doughnuts, and Max might mention as a reason
against, the fact that it is so difficult to get parking there this
time of day. It is some sign—perhaps not a perfect sign, but
some sign—that each of these really is a reason, that
Max and Caroline feel the tug in each direction. Mention of the
Alcove’s onion rings makes them feel to at least some degree
inclined to go, and mention of the parking arrangements makes them
feel to at least some degree inclined not to. According to some
philosophers, reasons for action always bear some relation
like this to motivation. This idea is variously known as
‘reasons internalism’, ‘internalism about
reasons’, or ‘the internal reasons theory’.
According to other philosophers, not all reasons are related to
motivation in any of the ways internalists say. This idea is known as
‘reasons externalism’ or ‘externalism about

minds—by reading psychology texts, by observing facial
expressions (in a mirror), by examining readouts of brain activity, by
noting patterns of past behavior—but it's generally thought that
you can also learn about your mind introspectively, in a way
that no one else can. But what exactly is introspection? No simple
characterization is widely accepted.


Introspection is a key concept in epistemology, since introspective
knowledge is often thought to be particularly secure, maybe even
immune to skeptical doubt. Introspective knowledge is also often held
to be more immediate or direct than sensory knowledge. Both of these
putative features of introspection have been cited in support of the
idea that introspective knowledge can serve as a ground or foundation
for other sorts of knowledge.


Introspection is also central to philosophy of mind, both as a process
worth study in its own right and as a court of appeal for other claims
about the mind. Philosophers of mind offer a variety of theories of
the nature of introspection; and philosophical claims about
consciousness, emotion, free will, personal identity, thought, belief,
imagery, perception, and other mental phenomena are often thought to
have introspective consequences or to be susceptible to introspective
verification. For similar reasons, empirical psychologists too have
discussed the accuracy of introspective judgments and the role of
introspection in the science of the mind.

Intuitionism in Ethics,0.5634365677833557,0.6486313343048096,"


Ethical Intuitionism was one of the dominant forces in British moral
philosophy from the early 18th century till the 1930s. It
fell into disrepute in the 1940s, but towards the end of the twentieth
century Ethical Intuitionism began to re-emerge as a respectable moral
theory. It has not regained the dominance it once enjoyed, but many
philosophers, including Robert Audi, Jonathan Dancy, David Enoch,
Michael Huemer, David McNaughton, and Russ Shafer-Landau, are now
happy to be labelled intuitionists.


The most distinctive features of ethical intuitionism are its
epistemology and ontology. All classical intuitionists maintain that
 basic moral propositions are
 self-evident,[1]
 and that moral properties are non-natural
properties. So the discussion of intuitionism will focus on just these
two features. Some philosophers claim that ethical pluralism (the view
that there is an irreducible plurality of basic moral principles, and
that there is no strict priority of any one principle over another) is
an essential feature of intuitionist thought, but not all intuitionists
are pluralists, e.g., Sidgwick and Moore, so this feature will not be
discussed here.

Intuitionism in the Philosophy of Mathematics,0.915233075618744,0.8044556975364685,"


Intuitionism is a philosophy of mathematics that was introduced by the
Dutch mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer (1881–1966). Intuitionism is
based on the idea that mathematics is a creation of the mind. The
truth of a mathematical statement can only be conceived via a mental
construction that proves it to be true, and the communication between
mathematicians only serves as a means to create the same mental
process in different minds.


This view on mathematics has far reaching implications for the daily
practice of mathematics, one of its consequences being that the
principle of the excluded middle, \((A \vee \neg A)\), is no longer
valid. Indeed, there are propositions, like the Riemann hypothesis,
for which there exists currently neither a proof of the statement nor
of its negation. Since knowing the negation of a statement in
intuitionism means that one can prove that the statement is not true,
this implies that both \(A\) and \(\neg A\) do not hold
intuitionistically, at least not at this moment. The dependence of
intuitionism on time is essential: statements can become provable in
the course of time and therefore might become intuitionistically valid
while not having been so before.


Besides the rejection of the principle of the excluded middle,
intuitionism strongly deviates from classical mathematics in the
conception of the continuum, which in the former setting has the
property that all total functions on it are continuous. Thus, unlike several
other theories of constructive mathematics, intuitionism is not a
restriction of classical reasoning; it contradicts classical
mathematics in a fundamental way.


Brouwer devoted a large part of his life to the development of
mathematics on this new basis. Although intuitionism has never replaced
classical mathematics as the standard view on mathematics, it has
always attracted a great deal of attention and is still widely studied
today.
In this entry we concentrate on the aspects of intuitionism that set
it apart from other branches of constructive mathematics, and the part
that it shares with other forms of constructivism, such as
foundational theories and models, is discussed only briefly.

Intuitionistic Logic,0.8660565614700317,0.8374326229095459,"

Intuitionistic logic encompasses the general principles of logical
reasoning which have been abstracted by logicians from intuitionistic
mathematics, as developed by
 L. E. J. Brouwer
 beginning in his [1907] and [1908]. Because these principles also
hold for Russian recursive mathematics and the constructive analysis
of E. Bishop and his followers, intuitionistic logic may be considered
the logical basis of
 constructive mathematics.
 Although intuitionistic analysis conflicts with classical analysis,
intuitionistic Heyting arithmetic is a subsystem of classical Peano
arithmetic. It follows that intuitionistic propositional logic is a
proper subsystem of classical propositional logic, and pure
intuitionistic predicate logic is a proper subsystem of pure classical
predicate logic. 

Philosophically,
 intuitionism
 differs from
 logicism
 by treating logic as a part of mathematics rather than as the
foundation of mathematics; from
 finitism
 by allowing constructive reasoning about uncountable structures
(e.g., monotone bar induction on the tree of potentially infinite
sequences of natural numbers); and from
 Platonism
 by viewing mathematical objects as mental constructs with no
independent ideal existence. Hilbert’s
 formalist program,
 to justify classical mathematics by reducing it to a formal system
whose consistency should be established by finitistic (hence
constructive) means, was the most powerful contemporary rival to
Brouwer’s developing intuitionism. In his 1912 essay
Intuitionism and Formalism Brouwer correctly predicted that
any attempt to prove the consistency of complete induction on the
natural numbers would lead to a vicious circle. 

Brouwer rejected
 formalism
per se but admitted the potential usefulness of formulating
general logical principles expressing intuitionistically correct
constructions, such as modus ponens. Formal systems for
intuitionistic propositional and predicate logic and arithmetic were
fully developed by Heyting [1930], Gentzen [1935] and Kleene [1952].
Gödel [1933] proved the equiconsistency of intuitionistic and
classical theories. Beth [1956] and Kripke [1965] provided semantics
with respect to which intuitionistic logic is correct and complete,
although the completeness proofs for intuitionistic predicate logic
require some classical reasoning.

The Development of Intuitionistic Logic,0.9188953042030334,0.8139286041259766,"

“Intuitionistic logic” is a term that unfortunately gains
ever greater currency; it conveys a wholly false view on
intuitionistic mathematics.
—Freudenthal 1937


Intuitionistic logic is an offshoot of L.E.J. Brouwer’s
intuitionistic mathematics. A widespread misconception has it that
intuitionistic logic is the logic underlying Brouwer’s
intuitionism; instead, the intuitionism underlies the logic, which is
construed as an application of intuitionistic mathematics to language.
Intuitionistic mathematics consists in the act of effecting mental
constructions of a certain kind. These are themselves not linguistic
in nature, but when acts of construction and their results are
described in a language, the descriptions may come to exhibit
linguistic patterns. Intuitionistic logic is the mathematical study of
these patterns, and in particular of those that characterize valid
inferences. An inference rule is valid if, whenever the statements in
the premises describe truths of intuitionistic mathematics, a
construction can be found that makes true the statement that is
obtained by applying the rule. What the principles of logic need to
preserve is therefore not, as in classical logic, mind-independent
truth, but mental constructibility. Various principles of classical
logic, most notably the Principle of the Excluded Middle, then become
insufficiently grounded, and certain classical theorems even
contradictory. The theorems in intuitionistic logic that formally
contradict classical theorems depend on elements of intuitionistic
mathematics that are incompatible with classical mathematics; this
illustrates how in intuitionism logic is based on mathematics and not
the other way around.

The systematic explanation and formalization of intuitionistic logic
was begun by Brouwer’s student Arend Heyting in 1928. An
“explanation” here is an account of what one knows when
one understands and correctly uses the logical connectives. Since the
1970s Heyting’s explanation and its variants are known as
“the Proof Interpretation”, as the role played by
mind-independent truth in explanations of classical logic is here
played by proof. For Heyting, a proof was primarily a mathematical
construction in Brouwer’s sense, and, secondarily, a linguistic
description of it. But it turned out that a Proof Interpretation can
also be based on other notions of proof. The Proof Interpretation
understood in a more general sense has found many applications outside
its historical origin, notably in other constructive but
non-intuitionistic forms of mathematics, philosophy, computer science,
and linguistics. This widening of the range of application was
possible because the original Proof Interpretation depends mostly on
the fact that the intuitionistic notion of mathematical truth is of a
verificationist nature, so that broadly verificationist theories in
other domains allow for an analogous explanation of their logic.

In this article, the principal concern is with the development of the
Proof Interpretation within its original context of intuitionistic
mathematics. Section 1 comments on terminology. Section 2 examines the
basis of Brouwer’s conception of logic in his early writings.
Section 3 presents his later refinements and also his views on
Hilbert’s Program, Gödel’s incompleteness theorems,
and the debate in the foundations of mathematics in the 1920s. Section
4 discusses formalizations of intuitionistic logic, which had begun
even before the Proof Interpretation had been made explicit, and
briefly looks at mathematical interpretations of the formalisms
obtained. The explanation of the Proof Interpretation in
Heyting’s writings from 1930 to 1956 is treated in section 5.
The sensitivity of intuitionistic logic to the exact conception of
mathematical construction was at the root of strong objections to
parts of the Proof Interpretation that arose from within intuitionism.
These are discussed in section 6. At the end, a short list is given of
topics that will be added in future updates.

Intuitionistic Type Theory,0.8804696202278137,0.8223484754562378,"
Intuitionistic type theory (also constructive type theory or
Martin-Löf type theory) is a formal logical system and philosophical
foundation for
 constructive mathematics. It is a
full-scale system which aims to play a similar role for constructive
mathematics as
 Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory
 does for
classical mathematics. It is based on the propositions-as-types
principle and clarifies the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation
of intuitionistic logic. It extends this interpretation to the more
general setting of intuitionistic type theory and thus provides a
general conception not only of what a constructive proof is, but also
of what a constructive mathematical object is. The main idea is that
mathematical concepts such as elements, sets and functions are
explained in terms of concepts from programming such as data
structures, data types and programs. This article describes the formal
system of intuitionistic type theory and its semantic foundations.
In this entry, we first give an overview of the most important
aspects of intuitionistic type theory—a kind of “extended
abstract”. It is meant for a reader who is already somewhat
familiar with the theory. Section 2 on the other hand, is meant for a
reader who is new to intuitionistic type theory but familiar with
traditional logic, including propositional and predicate logic,
arithmetic, and set theory. Here we informally introduce several
aspects which distinguishes intuitionistic type theory from these
traditional theories. In Section 3 we present a basic version of the
theory, close to Martin-Löf’s first published version from
1972. The reader who was intrigued by the informality of Section 2
will now see in detail how the theory is built up. Section 4 then
presents a number of important extensions of the basic theory. In
particular, it emphasizes the central role of inductive (and
inductive-recursive) definitions. Section 5 introduces the underlying
philosophical ideas including the theory of meaning developed by
Martin-Löf. While Section 5 is about philosophy and foundations,
Section 6 gives an overview of mathematical models of the theory. In
Section 7 finally, we describe several important variations of the
core Martin-Löf “intensional” theory described in
Section 3 and 4.

strawberries and ripe tomatoes produce visual experiences of the sort
that are actually produced by grass and cucumbers, grass and cucumbers

strawberries and ripe tomatoes, and so on. This entry surveys the main
philosophical applications of what Dennett has called “one of

Isaac Israeli,0.5867437720298767,0.16024847328662872,"


Isaac ben Solomon Israeli (ca. 855–955 CE), not to be confused with
Isaac Israeli the Younger (an astronomer of Spain, d. 1322 CE), served
as physician to the founder of the Fatimid Dynasty in North Africa and
wrote several philosophical and medical treatises in Arabic which were
subsequently translated and widely read in Latin and Hebrew. Israeli
was one of the earliest medieval Jewish Neoplatonist writers, though
not as original in his thinking as later Jewish philosophers such as
Solomon Ibn Gabirol (Avicebron), Moses Maimonides and Gersonides. His
work reflected and encapsulated the prevailing philosophical paradigm,
namely, Aristotelian thought read through a Neoplatonist
lens. Israeli’s thought was largely influenced by the Arab philosopher
al-Kindi (d. ca. 870 CE) and by available Neoplatonist sources,
either The Theology of Aristotle or (by S. M. Stern’s
hypothesis) a pseudepigraphic Neoplatonist treatise (no longer extant
in the Arabic original) which was later translated into Hebrew by
Abraham Ibn Hasday (d. 1240) and appended to the belles-lettrist
work The Prince and the Ascetic. Although much of his work is
paraphrase and commentary on these two sources, Israeli’s thought did
include a few divergences from al-Kindi, such as the idea of the
emanation of shadow, and a reversal of the process of intellection
described in al-Kindi’s model. Israeli’s philosophical works were read
by several later Jewish and Christian authors who occasionally quoted
him, sometimes without attribution. His medical treatises were widely
read and respected by physicians for centuries in Muslim and Christian
domains.

Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi,0.5903392434120178,0.4291177093982697,"


Polemicist, socialite, and literary figure, Jacobi was an outspoken
critic, first of the rationalism of German late Enlightenment
philosophy, then of Kant's Transcendental Idealism, especially in the
form that the early Fichte gave to it, and finally of the Romantic
Idealism of the late Schelling. In all cases, his opposition to the
philosophers was based on his belief that their passion for
explanation unwittingly led them to confuse conditions of
conceptualization with conditions of existence, thereby denying all
room for individual freedom or for a personal God. Jacobi made this
point, in defence of individualism and personalistic values, in a
number of public controversies, in the course of which he put in
circulation expressions and themes that resonate to this day. He was
the one who invited Lessing, who he thought was walking on his head in
the manner of all philosophers, to perform a salto mortale (a
jump heels over head) that would redress his position and thus allow
him to move again on the ground of common sense. He was also
responsible for forging the concept of ‘nihilism’ —
a condition of which he accused the philosophers — and thereby
initiating the discourse associated with it. His battle cry, which he
first directed at the defenders of Enlightenment rationalism and then
at Kant and his successors, was that ‘consistent philosophy is
Spinozist, hence pantheist, fatalist and atheist’. The formula
had the effect of bringing Spinoza to the centre of the philosophical
discussion of the day. In the face Kant and his idealistic successors,
Jacobi complained that they had subverted the language of the
‘I’ by reintroducing it on the basis of abstractions that
in fact negated its original value. They had thus replaced real
selfhood with the mere illusion of one.


But perhaps the most influential of Jacobi's formulas was the claim
that there is no ‘I’ without a ‘Thou’, and
that the two can recognize and respect one another only in the
presence of a transcendent and personal God. Because of his defence of
the individual and the ‘exception’, Jacobi is sometime
taken as a proto-existentialist. This view must be balanced by the
consideration that Jacobi was a defender of conservative values that
he felt threatened by the culture of the day; that he never considered
himself an irrationalist; on the contrary, that he thought his
‘faith’ to be essentially and truly rational; and that he
tried more than once to develop a positive theory of reason. As a
literary figure, he criticized the Sturm und Drang movement
and dramatized in two novels the problem of reconciling individualism
with social obligation. An exponent of British economic and political
liberalism, Jacobi was an early critic of the French revolution, the
destructiveness of which he considered the practical counterpart of
the speculative nihilism of the philosophers.

William James,0.6490560173988342,0.2569557726383209,"


William James was an original thinker in and between the disciplines
of physiology, psychology and philosophy. His twelve-hundred page
masterwork, The Principles of Psychology (1890), is a rich
blend of physiology, psychology, philosophy, and personal reflection
that has given us such ideas as “the stream of thought”
and the baby’s impression of the world “as one great blooming,
buzzing confusion” (PP 462). It contains seeds of pragmatism and
phenomenology, and influenced generations of thinkers in Europe and
America, including Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell, John Dewey, and
Ludwig Wittgenstein. James studied at Harvard’s Lawrence Scientific
School and the School of Medicine, but his writings were from the
outset as much philosophical as scientific. “Some Remarks on
Spencer’s Notion of Mind as Correspondence” (1878) and
“The Sentiment of Rationality” (1879, 1882) presage his
future pragmatism and pluralism, and contain the first statements of
his view that philosophical theories are reflections of a
philosopher’s temperament.


James hints at his religious concerns in his earliest essays and
in The Principles, but they become more explicit in The
Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy
(1897), Human Immortality: Two Supposed Objections to the
Doctrine (1898), The Varieties of Religious Experience
(1902) and A Pluralistic Universe (1909). James oscillated
between thinking that a “study in human nature” such
as Varieties could contribute to a “Science of
Religion” and the belief that religious experience involves an
altogether supernatural domain, somehow inaccessible to science but
accessible to the individual human subject. 


James made some of his most important philosophical contributions in
the last decade of his life. In a burst of writing in 1904–5
(collected in  Essays in Radical Empiricism (1912)) he set
out the metaphysical view most commonly known as “neutral
monism,” according to which there is one fundamental
“stuff” that is neither material nor mental.  In
“A Pluralistic Universe” he defends the mystical and
anti-pragmatic view that concepts distort rather than reveal reality,
and in his influential Pragmatism (1907), he presents
systematically a set of views about truth, knowledge, reality,
religion, and philosophy that permeate his writings from the late
1870s onwards.

The Kokugaku (Native Studies) School,0.4353203773498535,0.4511473178863525,"


The term “Kokugaku,” literally “the study of our
country,” refers to an intellectual movement that emerged in
late eighteenth century Japan in explicit opposition to
“Kangaku” or “Chinese Studies,” the study of
Confucian works. Those associated with the Kokugaku movement
criticized the study of the Confucian classics, the primary object of
intellectual endeavor in early modern Japan, and made the earliest
Japanese works, which they asserted had escaped Chinese influence, the
object of philological and exegetical examination. Ironically, even
these works, the mytho-histories Kojiki (“Record of
Ancient Matters,” 712 and Nihon shoki
(“Chronicles of Japan,” 720), and the poetic anthology,
Man'yôshû (“The Ten Thousand Leaves,”
(late 8th century), were written in Chinese characters and
to a large degree in what is recognizable as the syntax of classical
Chinese, since they predate the formation of the Japanese syllabaries.
However, Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801), arguably the most influential
of the nativist scholars, asserted that when rigorously read with a
correct understanding of the ancient Japanese language, these texts
reveal that Japan had in ancient times been a natural community in
which subject and ruler lived in perfect harmony with each other and
the deities, with no need for the flawed ethical principles or
coercive forms of governance authorized by Confucianism.  Norinaga's
work established the issues of language and textuality as central
methodological concerns within Kokugaku discourse and made the
exposition of cultural and social difference (first in relation to
China and later with the West) a central theme.


In the mid-nineteenth century, some students of Kokugaku, most notably
those associated with the school of Hirata Atsutane (1776-1843),
became involved in the movement to overthrow the Shogunate and return
the emperor to real political power. They asserted that the ancient
texts revealed that the emperor alone was divinely authorized to
govern Japan. After the Meiji Restoration of 1868, modern ideologues
used language and ideas derived from Kokugaku discourse to create of a
new ideology of imperial rule. From the 1880s onward, scholars working
within the new modern disciplines of “National Literature”
and “National History” argued that Kokugaku represented
the rise of a modern sense of nation among the Japanese people. After
World War II, however, Kokugaku came to be widely viewed as the
intellectual point of origin for views that contributed to the rise of
fascism and militarism in Japan in the 1930s and 40s.

Nishida Kitarō was the most significant and influential Japanese
philosopher of the twentieth-century. His work is pathbreaking in
several respects: it established in Japan the creative discipline of
philosophy as practiced in Europe and the Americas; it enriched that
discipline by infusing Anglo-European philosophy with Asian sources of
thought; it provided a new basis for philosophical treatments of East
Asian Buddhist thought; and it produced novel theories of self and
world with rich implications for contemporary
philosophizing. Nishida’s work is also frustrating for its repetitive
and often obscure style, exceedingly abstract formulations, and
detailed but frequently dead-end investigations.  Nishida once said of
his work, “I have always been a miner of ore; I have never
managed to refine it” (Nishida 1958, Preface). A concise
presentation of his achievements therefore will require extensive
selection, interpretation and clarification.


This article presents his work in a roughly chronological order. We
may understand his philosophical project overall as an attempt to
restore to experience and consciousness the rigor, necessity and
universality accorded to logic. This project developed in a direction
quite opposite to that of psychologism, which would reduce logic to
the contingencies of the individual mind or brain. It also differed
from efforts to establish pure logic as a self-explanatory realm in
that Nishida insisted on the starting point of experience, a priority
he shared with Husserl’s phenomenology and William James’ radical
empiricism. We might characterize his philosophy in general as a
phenomenological metaphysics for its universalizing of first-person
experience. It can also be considered an ontology of logical forms for
its investigations of their experiential basis, with one
qualification: although Nishida proposed a unitary source of such
forms, that source is neither exclusionary nor positive; in other
words the source itself cannot be described monistically as a single,
more basic form or thing.  Nishida eventually called this source
“mu” (nothingness), a notion he found particularly prominent in
the traditions of the East.  His interests led him to develop a
philosophy of culture, and his status as Japan’s premier philosopher
led government officials to call upon him for justification of
Japanese expansionism in the late 1930s and early 40s. His last work
recapitulated his non-dualistic account of world and self, but also
reinterpreted the meaning of death.

Japanese Pure Land Philosophy,0.4345355331897736,0.3797179162502289,"


 Pure Land Buddhist
teachings have played a major role in Japanese intellectual and social
life from the sixth century CE, when emissaries from the Korean
peninsula first officially introduced Buddhist images and texts to the
Japanese court, down to the present. While the influence of the Zen
tradition on Japanese thought and culture is widely acknowledged, the
role of Pure Land Buddhist concepts and sensibilities have tended to
receive only marginal recognition in the West; nevertheless, it is
impossible to ignore their perhaps even more pervasive force. Moreover,
as D. T. Suzuki (1870–1966) has noted, 

The Japanese may not have
offered very many original ideas to world thought or world culture, but
in Shin we find a major contribution the Japanese can make to the
outside world and to all other Buddhist
 schools. (Suzuki 1970, pp. 13–14)

Although Suzuki does not define what ideas he
has in mind, he indicates that it is specifically in relation to the
Pure Land tradition that we find a significant, innovative development
in Buddhist philosophy that has taken place in Japan.


 In brief, the
Japanese Pure Land contribution to Buddhist philosophy may be said to
lie in its fusion of two fundamental attitudes. On the one hand, it
stands squarely upon a Mahayana Buddhist conception of enlightened
wisdom as radically nondichotomous and nondual with reality, indicated
with such terms as thusness, buddha-nature, and emptiness. On the other
hand, it directly confronts the nature of human existence in its
ineluctable finitude: karmically conditioned, discriminative and
reifying in awareness, and given to the afflicting passions of
attachment to a falsely conceived self surrounded by substantial
objects. Through its probing religious anthropology, Japanese Pure Land
thought explores the paradoxical issues of how transformative awakening
can be possible for the ignorant self, how attainment as liberation
from defiled self-will can occur, and the nature of the world of
religious realization that unfolds within the locus of a person’s
samsaric existence.

Watsuji Tetsurô,0.4187680184841156,0.4396409690380096,"


Watsuji Tetsurō(1889–1960) was one of a small group of
philosophers in Japan during the twentieth century who brought
Japanese philosophy to the world.  He wrote important works on both
Eastern and Western philosophy and philosophers, from ancient Greek,
to Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard and Heidegger, and from
primitive Buddhism and ancient Japanese culture, to Dōgen (whose
now famous writings Watsuji single-handedly rediscovered), aesthetics,
and Japanese ethics. His works on Japanese ethics are still regarded
as the definitive studies.

 Influenced by Heidegger, Watsuji's Climate and Culture is
both an appreciation of, and a critique of Heidegger. In particular,
Watsuji argues that Heidegger under-emphasizes spatiality, and
over-emphasizes temporality.  Watsuji contends that had Heidegger
equally emphasized spatiality, it would have tied him more firmly to
the human world where we interact, both fruitfully and negatively. We
are inextricably social, connected in so many ways, and ethics is the
study of these social connections and positive ways of
interacting.

 Human beings have a dual-nature, as individuals, and as member of
various social groupings. We face each other in the betweenness
between us, where we can either maintain a safe distance, or enter
into intimate relationships of worth. Fundamental to positive,
intimate relationships is trust, and trustworthiness.

Karl Jaspers,0.5441381335258484,0.5054486393928528,"


Karl Jaspers (1883–1969) began his academic career working as
a psychiatrist and, after a period of transition, he converted to
philosophy in the early 1920s. Throughout the middle decades of the
twentieth century he exercised considerable influence on a number of
areas of philosophical inquiry: especially on epistemology, the
philosophy of religion, and political theory.


The influence of Kant over Jaspers is widely acknowledged in the
literature, to the extent that he has been depicted as “The
first and the last Kantian” (Heinrich Barth, quoted in Ehrlich
1975, 211). Usually this evaluation is based on his reliance on the
subjective-experiential transformation of Kantian philosophy, which
reconstructs Kantian transcendentalism as a doctrine of particular
experience and spontaneous freedom, and emphasizes the constitutive
importance of lived existence for authentic knowledge. However,
current commentators of his philosophy have started questioning this
view.  Jaspers obtained his widest influence, not through his
philosophy, but through his writings on governmental conditions in
Germany, and after the collapse of National Socialist regime he
emerged as a powerful spokesperson for moral-democratic education and
reorientation in the Federal Republic of Germany.


Despite his importance in the evolution of both philosophy and
political theory in twentieth-century Germany, today Jaspers is to a
large extent a neglected thinker. The explanations that are given for
this are various. In the first place, it is argued that he did not
found a particular philosophical school. For him, philosophy is a way
of thought, which uses expert knowledge while going beyond it. He
believed that by means of devoting oneself to philosophy, individuals
do not cognize objects but explicate and actualize their being as
thinkers and thus become  themselves. Consequently, he did not
attract a cohort of apostles, and, outside Germany at least, his works
are not often the subject of high philosophical discussion. This is
partly the result of the fact that the philosophers who now enjoy
undisputed dominance in modern German philosophical history,
especially Martin Heidegger, Georg Lukács and Theodor
W. Adorno, wrote disparagingly about Jaspers, and they were often
unwilling to take his work entirely seriously. Another explanation for
Jaspers’s relative marginality relates to problematic nature of the
English translations of his writings that render his thinking rather
incommunicable to readers from English speaking countries. To be sure,
he was extremely fortunate with his many translators, the most
prominent of whom are Ralph Manheim and E.B. Ashton. But the
translations often use misleading expression, choose different words
to express the very same word in the original German, and thus confuse
the readers. Also, unindicated omissions and other problems that
result from favouring aesthetic considerations over accuracy all
contribute to falsifying the original. It has been argued that Jaspers
could not appeal to the English-speaking philosophical mind due to
being too speculative and metaphysical or simply beyond the reach of
the Anglo-American cultural horizons. To all these factors, one might
add the fact of Jaspers’s association with the more prosaic
periods of German political life, and of his name being tarred with an
aura of staid bourgeois common sense. Nonetheless, Jaspers’s work set
the parameters for a number of different philosophical debates, the
consequences of which remain deeply influential in contemporary
philosophy, and in recent years there have been signs that a more
favourable reconstructive approach to his work is beginning to
prevail.

basic criteria of validity for valid cognitive procedures, which is not
possible without a prior true knowledge of reality against which we
could test the procedures for validity etc. Clearly, our knowledge of
reality and of objects depends on valid cognitive procedures. However,
all valid cognitive procedures are either fundamentally flawed and
ultimately unreliable or they require further valid cognitive
procedures, and these stand in the same need etc. Therefore, we can
neither formulate proper definitions of valid cognitive procedures nor
define what reality is and what basic categories are. This is at least

humans, their place in the cosmos, and the good life that owed much to
ancient philosophers like Epictetus, Antoninus, and Cicero; to the
ethical precepts of Jesus; to coetaneous Scottish empiricists like
Francis Hutcheson and Lord Kames; and even to esteemed religionists

John of Salisbury (1115/20–1180) was among the foremost
philosophers of the so-called twelfth century Renaissance,
contributing to the development of political and moral philosophy as
well as to the medieval theory of education and to the dissemination
of emerging Aristotelian learning. Having received an extensive
education in Paris, he spent most of his life as an active servant of
the church. An associate of Archbishop Thomas Becket of Canterbury
during his dispute with King Henry II of England, John eventually was
raised to the office of Bishop of Chartres. John’s thought has
been characterized as “humanistic”, since he valorizes the
dignity of humanity and of nature generally: The latter is
intelligible and may be understood through the application of natural
reason. Yet John admitted that severe impediments exist to the
attainment of wisdom. Throughout his writings, he professed to follow
the moderate skepticism of Cicero and the New Academy, which rejected
dogmatic claims to certainty. The best that rational human inquiry may
in most matters achieve, John says, is probable truth, always subject
to re-evaluation and revision. The general tenor of his philosophy is
reflected in his advocacy of moderation and his emphasis on nature as
a normative guide to earthly fulfillment. John composed several
treatises of philosophical interest, most notably the
Policraticus (PC), but also the Metalogicon (ML) and
the Entheticus de dogmate philosophorum (EMM). These works were all
completed between 1154 and 1159, during the period of John’s
service to Archbishop Theobald, Becket’s predecessor at the see
of Canterbury. John’s other writings—two letter
collections, two hagiographies, and a history—evince the
practical application of his philosophical commitments.

Emily Elizabeth Constance Jones (1848–1922), a contemporary of
Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore at Cambridge University, worked
primarily in philosophical logic and ethics. Her most significant
contribution to the former area is her application of the
intension-extension distinction to singular terms, anticipating
Frege's related distinction between sense and reference and
Russell's pre-“On Denoting” distinction between
meaning and denotation. Widely regarded as an authority on
philosophical logic by figures as diverse as F. C. S. Schiller and G.
F. Stout on the one hand and C. S. Peirce on the other, Jones appeared
in published symposia alongside such eminent contemporaries as W. E.
Johnson and Bernard Bosanquet and became, in 1896, the first woman to
present a paper at the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club. Jones was
sufficiently esteemed by Peirce for him to cite her Elements of
Logic as a Science of Propositions as an authoritative source on
the “Material Fallacy” in Baldwin's widely-read
reference work, Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology.
Her major publication, A New Law of Thought and its Logical
Bearings, published in 1911 by Cambridge University Press,
contained an enthusiastic preface by Stout and was received
favorably in Mind, where the reviewer, Schiller,
remarked: “Miss Jones has made a great discovery.”
In the same year, Russell delivered a paper to the
Moral Sciences Club, subsequently published as “Knowledge by
Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description”, responding to a
critical paper by Jones, delivered to the same society some months
earlier. Jones also published in ethics, and was regarded
by Henry Sidgwick, her mentor, as one of his prize students. Yet,
despite the fact that she published numerous articles, a monograph and
several textbooks (some going into multiple editions), and was a very
visible member of the English philosophical community from the
1890s until her death in 1922, she is now almost entirely
forgotten.

Justice,0.4697809219360352,0.7101199626922607,"

The idea of justice occupies centre stage both in ethics, and in
legal and political philosophy. We apply it to individual
actions, to laws, and to public policies, and we think in each case
that if they are unjust this is a strong, maybe even conclusive, reason
to reject them. Classically, justice was counted as one of the
four cardinal virtues (and sometimes as the most important of the
four); in modern times John Rawls famously described it as ‘the
first virtue of social institutions’ (Rawls 1971, p.3; Rawls,
1999, p.3). We might debate which of these realms of practical
philosophy has first claim on justice: is it first and foremost a
property of the law, for example, and only derivatively a property of
individuals and other institutions? But it is probably more
enlightening to accept that the idea has over time sunk deep roots in
each of these domains, and to try to make sense of such a wide-ranging
concept by identifying elements that are present whenever justice is
invoked, but also examining the different forms it takes in various
practical contexts. This article aims to provide a general map of
the ways in which justice has been understood by philosophers, past and
present. 


We begin by identifying four core features that distinguish justice
from other moral and political ideas. We then examine some major
conceptual contrasts: between conservative and ideal justice, between
corrective and distributive justice, between procedural and
substantive justice, and between comparative and non-comparative
justice.  Next we turn to questions of scope: to who or what do
principles of justice apply? We ask whether non-human animals can be
subjects of justice, whether justice applies only between people who
already stand in a particular kind of relationship to one another, and
whether individual people continue to have duties of justice once
justice-based institutions have been created. We then examine three
overarching theories that might serve to unify the different forms of
justice: utilitarianism, contractarianism, and egalitarianism. But it
seems, in conclusion, that no such theory is likely be successful.

Justice and Bad Luck,0.5081723332405089,0.7453956007957458,"
 Some people end up worse off than others partly because of their
bad luck. For instance, some die young due to a genetic disease,
whereas others live long lives. Are such differential luck induced
inequalities unjust? Many are inclined to answer this question
affirmatively. To understand this inclination, we need a clear account
of what luck involves. On some accounts, luck nullifies
responsibility. On others, it nullifies desert. It is often said that
justice requires luck to be ‘neutralized’. However, it is
contested whether a distributive pattern that eliminates the influence
of luck can be described. Thus an agent’s level of
effort—something few would initially see as a matter of
luck—might be inseparable from her level of
talent—something most would initially see as a matter of
luck—and this might challenge standard accounts of just
deviation from equality (or, for that matter, other favored
distributive patterns). Critically, relational egalitarians argue that
so-called luck egalitarians’ preoccupation with eliminating
inequalities reflecting differential bad luck misconstrues justice,
which, according to the former, is a matter of social relations having
a suitably egalitarian character.

Intergenerational Justice,0.5207063555717468,0.7998017668724059,"


Do justice considerations apply to intergenerational relations, that
is, to relations between non-contemporaries? If we follow a broad
understanding of justice (see Mill 1863, ch. 5) this is the case if
future or past generations can be viewed as holding legitimate claims
or
 rights[1]
 against present generations, who in turn stand under correlative
duties to future or past generations. One of the legitimate claims of
future generations vis-à-vis present generations appears to be
a claim of distributive justice: Depending on the understanding of the
relevant principles of distributive justice to be applied, if there is
an intergenerational conflict of interests, present generations may be
obligated by considerations of justice not to pursue policies that
impose an unfair intergenerational distribution of costs and benefits.


This entry will focus primarily on two questions: first, whether
present generations can be duty-bound because of considerations of
justice to past and future people; and second, whether other moral
considerations should guide those currently alive in relating to both
past and future people. Concerning the first question, the entry will
suggest that present generations have duties of justice to future
people but not to past people. Concerning the second question, the
entry will suggest that present generations also have additional moral
duties (duties not grounded in correlative rights) to future people as
well as moral duties to past people owing, in part, to the rights
these people had while alive. The entry will also argue for the
lasting significance of past injustices in terms of what is owed to
the descendants of the direct victims of the injustices. These are
contentious claims as the discussion will show.


While we owe the first systematic discussion of obligations to future
people within a theory of justice to John Rawls (see Section 4.4),
Derek Parfit’s work has defined the problems of how we can and should
relate to future people (see esp. Section 3).

Retributive Justice,0.36684301495552063,0.7485482096672058,"
The concept of retributive justice has been used in a variety of
ways, but it is best understood as that form of justice committed to
the following three principles: (1) that those who commit certain
kinds of wrongful acts, paradigmatically serious crimes, morally
deserve to suffer a proportionate punishment; (2) that it is
intrinsically morally good—good without reference to any other
goods that might arise—if some legitimate punisher gives them
the punishment they deserve; and (3) that it is morally impermissible
intentionally to punish the innocent or to inflict disproportionately
large punishments on wrongdoers. The idea of retributive justice has
played a dominant role in theorizing about punishment over the past
few decades, but many features of it—especially the notions of
desert and proportionality, the normative status of suffering, and the
ultimate justification for retribution—remain contested and
problematic.

 Once violent conflict between two groups has subsided, what is the
best way to transition to a civil society? Do former enemies need to
“come to terms with their past” if they are to live
peacefully? If such a reckoning is required, what are the strategies
of transition available to the parties?


The field of transitional justice, which investigates such questions,
involves the philosophical, legal, and political investigation of the
aftermath of war. This entry will provide an introduction to the
central problems animating this relatively new field. It will do so by
examining the history and difficulties associated with the operation
of three important transitional policies: war crime tribunals, truth
commissions, and lustration
 policies.[1]
 We will consider, among others questions,
tensions between the desire for peace and stability after war and the
importance of putting human rights violators on trial, the need, as
part of a political transition, to create a reliable historical record
of past abuses, the promise and limitations of international criminal
law, and the coherence of forgiveness in politics.


Part 1 provides a theoretical introduction to the nature of
transitional justice by highlighting the tensions between peace and
justice typical of transitional settings. Part 2 examines the
difficulties associated with war crime tribunals. Part 3 concentrates
on the dilemmas involved in the operation of truth commissions. Part 4
focuses on administrative purges or lustration policies. The final
section considers the possibility of forgetting as a response to

Justice as a Virtue,0.4718199074268341,0.7094099521636963,"

The notion of justice as a virtue began in reference to a trait of
individuals, and to some extent remains so, even if today we often
conceive the justice of individuals as having some (grounding)
reference to social justice. But from the start, the focus on justice
as a virtue faced pressures to diffuse, in two different ways.

First, “justice as a virtue” is ambiguous as between individual
and social applications. Rawls and others regard justice as “the
first virtue of social institutions” (1971, p. 3), but Rawls is not
the first to think of justice as a virtue of social institutions or
societies — Plato was there long before him. However, justice as
a virtue of societies, polities, and their institutions is addressed
 elsewhere,
 so the focus in this essay will be on justice as a virtue in
individuals. That said, individuals typically live as members of
political communities, so the societal dimension of justice as a
virtue will never be long out of view.

Second, from the start the effort to analyze the virtue of
justice has led to attempts to formalize the requirements (or
norms) of justice, and at times the latter project has threatened to
swallow the first in ways that make thinking of a virtue of
justice gratuitous or otiose. We might be tempted to think that the
virtue of justice consists simply in compliance with the norms of
justice our theory specifies: a just person will be one who complies
with the norms of justice, whether those are narrowly interpersonal or
more broadly social or political in scope. In this way the virtue
becomes subsidiary to norms of justice independently specified. Doing
so threatens to lose the force that the notion of virtue had in the
earliest thinking about justice. 

A further complication is that even the idea of justice as a virtue of
individuals seems ambiguous in regard to scope. Plato in the
Republic treats justice as an overarching virtue of both
individuals and societies, so that almost every issue he (or we) would
regard as ethical comes in under the notion of justice. But in later
usages justice covers only part of individual morality, and we don't
readily think of someone as unjust if they lie or neglect their
children — other epithets more readily spring to mind.
Individual justice first and most readily regards moral issues having
to do with distributions of goods or property. It is, we say, unjust
for someone to steal from people or not to give them what he owes
them, and it is also unjust if someone called upon to distribute
something good (or bad or both) among members of a group uses an
arbitrary or unjustified basis for making the distribution. Discussion
of justice as an individual virtue often centers on questions,
therefore, about property and other distributable goods, though the
broader sense broached by Plato never entirely disappears.

Coherentist Theories of Epistemic Justification,0.7900629639625549,0.7273359894752502,"

According to the coherence theory of justification, also known as
coherentism, a belief or set of beliefs is justified, or justifiably
held, just in case the belief coheres with a set of beliefs, the set
forms a coherent system or some variation on these themes. The
coherence theory of justification should be distinguished from the
coherence theory of truth. The former is a theory of what it
means for a belief or a set of beliefs to be justified, or for a
subject to be justified in holding the belief or set of beliefs. The
latter is a theory of what it means for a belief or proposition to be
true. Modern coherence theorists, in contrast to some earlier writers
in the British idealist tradition, typically subscribe to a coherence
theory of justification without advocating a coherence theory of
truth. Rather, they either favor a correspondence theory of truth or
take the notion of truth for granted, at least for the purposes of
their epistemological investigations. This does not prevent many
authors from claiming that coherence justification is an indication or
criterion of truth.

Internalist vs. Externalist Conceptions of Epistemic Justification,0.7056389451026917,0.7071323990821838,"


Generally, when a person knows some proposition or other, she does
so on the basis of something such as evidence, or good reasons, or
perhaps some experiences she has had. The same is true of justified
beliefs that may fall short of knowledge. These beliefs are justified
on the basis of some evidence, or good reasons, or experiences, or
maybe on the basis of the manner in which the beliefs were
produced.


Internalism in the first instance is a thesis about the basis of
either knowledge or justified belief. This first form of internalism
holds that a person either does or can have a form of access
to the basis for knowledge or justified belief. The key idea is that
the person either is or can be aware of this basis. Externalists, by
contrast, deny that one always can have this sort of access to the
basis for one's knowledge and justified belief. A second form of
internalism, connected just to justified belief but probably extendable
to knowledge as well, concerns not access but rather what the basis for
a justified belief really is. Mentalism is the thesis that what
ultimately justifies any belief is some mental state of the epistemic
agent holding that belief. Externalism on this dimension, then, would
be the view that things other than mental states operate as
justifiers. A third form of internalism concerns the very concept of
justification, rather than access to or the nature of justifiers. This
third form of internalism is the deontological concept of
justification, whose main idea is that the concept of epistemic
justification is to be analyzed in terms of fulfilling one's
intellectual duties or responsibilities. Externalism with respect to
the concept of epistemic justification would be the thesis that this
concept is to be analyzed in terms other than special duties or
responsibilities.

for another belief p in this way, it has become customary to
say that the justification for p transmits to q
across the inferential link from p to q.

Transmission of justification across inference is a valuable and
indeed ubiquitous epistemic phenomenon in everyday life and science.
It is thanks to the phenomenon of epistemic transmission that
inferential reasoning is a means for substantiating predictions of
future events and, more generally, for expanding the sphere of our
justified beliefs or reinforcing the justification of beliefs that we
already entertain. However, transmission of justification is not
without exceptions. As a few epistemologists have come to realise,
more or less trivial forms of circularity can prevent justification
from transmitting from p to q even if one has
justification for p and one is aware of the inferential link
from p to q. In interesting cases this happens because
one can acquire justification for p only if one has
independent justification for q. In this case the
justification for q cannot depend on the justification for
p and the inferential link from p to q, as
genuine transmission would require.

The phenomenon of transmission failure seems to shed light on
philosophical puzzles, such as Moore’s proof of a material world and
McKinsey’s paradox, and it plays a central role in various
philosophical debates. For this reason it is being granted continued
and increasing attention.

Public Justification,0.4689153134822846,0.6753681302070618,"

Some political philosophers and theorists place a requirement of
public justification on the permissible use of state coercion or
political power. According to these theorists the recognition of
citizens as free and equal moral persons requires that coercion be
justified for or to others by their own lights, or with reasons that
they could recognize as valid. On this view, a public justification is
achieved when members of the relevant public have adequate or
sufficient reason to endorse a particular coercive proposal, law or
policy. Those who endorse this requirement are often called public
reason liberals as they hold that the coercive power of the state must
be justified for or to all members of the public on the basis of good
reasons.

Coercion is taken to be the object of public justification because it
is the characteristic feature of political life. Charles Larmore
remarks that public justification has “to do with the sort of
respect we owe one another in the political realm — that is, in
relationships where the possibility of coercion is involved”
(Larmore 2008, 86). Rawls’s principle of public justification holds
that it is political power that must be justified (Rawls 2005, 12)
since, as he remarks, “political power is always coercive
power” (Rawls 2005, 68). Jonathan Quong holds that public
justification concerns the imposition of coercive laws (Quong 2011,
233–250). And, as Christopher Eberle puts it, (2002, 54)
“the clarion call of justificatory liberalism is the public
justification of coercion.” In recent years, some public reason
liberals have wondered whether legal coercion is all that requires
public justification (2.7), but they nonetheless agree that coercion
generally, if not always, requires public justification.

Notwithstanding the characteristic association between public reason
liberalism and the requirement of public justification, public
justification is the genus and public reason the species. The idea of
public justification is, at its root, an idea about what
justifies coercion. Although we can arrive at a state in which some
social arrangement is publicly justified by an explicit course of
reasoning leading to the legitimation of that social state, this is
not intrinsic to the more general idea of public justification, as
will be seen below. In particular, we can arrive at a social state in
which some arrangement is publicly justified by non-deliberative,
indeed non-discursive means, and it is for this reason that public
reason is a narrower notion than public justification.

John Rawls was the foremost advocate of the idea of public
justification, though its importance is also stressed in the works of
Jürgen Habermas, David Gauthier, Gerald Gaus, Stephen Macedo,
Charles Larmore, Seyla Benhabib, and many others. There is considerable
disagreement about how to understand the idea. For instance, some hold
that all public justifications must occur via shared or accessible
reasons (often called consensus theorists), whereas others (often
called convergence theorists) hold that public justification can be
obtained if different points of view each provide good grounds for a
particular policy (see
 Section 2.3
 below). Public justification theorists also disagree about the right
level of idealization or how to attribute reasons to citizens, which
often involves imagining them as possessing superior information and
cognitive abilities. This entry explicates the idea of public
justification in terms of a Public Justification Principle (PJP) that
provides a classificatory system for these competing conceptions.

The entry begins by situating the idea of public justification in
the history of political philosophy and examining the motivations for
employing it. The PJP is then stated and explained, along with its
relevant variables, including the conceptions of justificatory
reasons, idealization, modalities of public justification, and whether
coercion alone requires public justification.  Different foundations
for the PJP are then discussed. The entry also discusses concepts
closely tied to public justification, such as the ideas of stability
and publicity. Various objections to the PJP are then reviewed and the
entry ends with a brief discussion of how the idea of public
justification is employed in various applied issues.

Kant's Transcendental Idealism,0.6416513919830322,0.4380930066108704,"

In the Critique of Pure Reason Kant argues that space and
time are merely formal features of how we perceive objects, not things
in themselves that exist independently of us, or properties or
relations among them. Objects in space and time are said to be
“appearances”, and he argues that we know nothing of
substance about the things in themselves of which they are
appearances. Kant calls this doctrine (or set of doctrines)
“transcendental idealism”, and ever since the publication
of the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason in 1781,
Kant’s readers have wondered, and debated, what exactly transcendental
idealism is, and have developed quite different interpretations. Some,
including many of Kant’s contemporaries, interpret transcendental
idealism as essentially a form of phenomenalism, similar in some
respects to that of Berkeley, while others think that it is not a
metaphysical or ontological theory at all. There is probably no major
interpretive question in Kant’s philosophy on which there is so little
consensus. This entry provides an introduction to the most important
Kantian texts, as well as the interpretive and philosophical issues
surrounding them.

Immanuel Kant,0.6236861944198608,0.4526465833187103,"


Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) is the central figure in modern
philosophy. He synthesized early modern rationalism and empiricism,
set the terms for much of nineteenth and twentieth century philosophy,
and continues to exercise a significant influence today in
metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics,
and other fields. The fundamental idea of Kant’s “critical
philosophy” – especially in his three Critiques: the
Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), the Critique of Practical Reason
(1788), and the Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790) – is
human autonomy. He argues that the human understanding is the source
of the general laws of nature that structure all our experience; and
that human reason gives itself the moral law, which is our basis for
belief in God, freedom, and immortality. Therefore, scientific
knowledge, morality, and religious belief are mutually consistent and
secure because they all rest on the same foundation of human autonomy,
which is also the final end of nature according to the teleological
worldview of reflecting judgment that Kant introduces to unify the
theoretical and practical parts of his philosophical system.

Kant's Account of Reason,0.6197990775108337,0.4555748999118805,"

Two of the most prominent questions in Kant’s critical philosophy
concern reason. One question is central to his theoretical philosophy.
It arises from the metaphysical assertions of earlier
“rationalist” philosophers, especially Leibniz and
Descartes. Which claims can reason hope to establish securely? A
second question is central to his practical philosophy. It arises from
the subservient role accorded to reason by the British
empiricists—above all Hume, who declared, “Reason is
wholly inactive, and can never be the source of so active a principle
as conscience, or a sense of morals” (Treatise,
3.1.1.11; see also the entry on
 rationalism vs. empiricism).
 What sort of practical relevance can reason claim? These questions
are reflected in the titles of two key works: the monumental
Critique of Pure Reason, and the Critique of Practical
Reason that is middle point of his great trio of moral writings
(between the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and
The Metaphysics of Morals).

It is clear that practical reason is the foundation of Kant’s moral
philosophy. It is less clear what role reason plays in his theoretical
philosophy. Kant insists that “metaphysics is utterly
impossible, or at best a disorderly and bungling endeavor” if we
do not separate “ideas of reason” from “concepts of
the understanding” (Prolegomena §41, 4:329). But
while he emphasizes the solidity of empirical knowledge gained through
the understanding, reason and its “ideas” often appear as
mere sources of error and illusion. (This is especially so for the
most-read sections of the first Critique—the Aesthetic,
Analytic and Dialectic.) But if this were all that Kant meant to say,
the status of philosophical reasoning would stand in grave doubt. In
addition, we might note that Kant rarely discusses reason as such.
This leaves a difficult interpretative task: just what is Kant’s
general and positive account of reason?

This entry has the following structure. The first section sets out the
role that reason plays in Kant’s account of knowledge and metaphysics
in the first Critique. The second section examines key
aspects of reason in the moral philosophy, with special reference to
the second Critique. Reflecting Kant’s canonical texts and
the bulk of the secondary literature, these discussions of theoretical
and practical reason are relatively independent of one another. The
third section therefore considers how Kant’s views of theoretical and
practical reason may be related. It emphasizes the most prominent
contemporary interpretation of Kantian reason, that of Onora O’Neill.
The concluding remarks underline the philosophical interest of a
unified interpretation of Kant’s account of reason.

Kant's Aesthetics and Teleology,0.5873072743415833,0.4654588997364044,"


Kant's views on aesthetics and teleology are given their fullest
presentation in his Critique of Judgment (Kritik der
Urteilskraft, also translated Critique of the Power of
Judgment), published in 1790.  This work is in two parts,
preceded by a long introduction in which Kant explains and defends the
work's importance in his critical system overall: in the first part,
the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment, Kant discusses
aesthetic experience and judgment, in particular of the beautiful and
the sublime, and also artistic creation; in the second part, the
Critique of Teleological Judgment, he discusses the role
of teleology (that is, appeal to ends, purposes or goals) in natural
science and in our understanding of nature more generally.
The Critique of Judgment was the third and last of Kant's
three Critiques, the other two being the Critique of Pure
Reason (1781, with a second edition in 1787), which deals with
metaphysics and epistemology, and the Critique of Practical
Reason of 1788, which, alongside his Groundwork of the
Metaphysics of Morals of 1785, deals with ethics.
 The Critique of Judgment has received less attention than
the other two Critiques.  One reason is that the areas of
aesthetics and natural teleology have traditionally been considered
less philosophically central than those of ethics, metaphysics and
epistemology.  Another is that it raises an interpretive problem which
has no analogue in the case of the other Critiques: that is,
how to make sense of the work as a whole given the seeming disparity
of the two parts, not only with each other, but also with the
faculty of judgment which is the work's ostensible focus.
However, Kant's aesthetic theory has always been extremely influential
within philosophical aesthetics and the philosophy of art, and since
the late 1970s there has been a rapidly expanding literature on Kant's
aesthetics within Anglo-American Kant interpretation.  Kant's views on
natural teleology, very much neglected in comparison to his
aesthetics, started to receive more attention in the early 1990s, and
there has been greatly increased interest, during the last ten years
in particular, both in Kant's view of teleology in its own right, and
in its potential relevance to contemporary philosophy of biology.
Moreover, over the last twenty years or so, more attention has been
directed towards the project of interpreting the Critique of
Judgment as a coherent whole.  With increased focus on its
general philosophical underpinnings, it has come to be seen not only
as significant within the disciplines of aesthetics and philosophy of
biology, but also as playing an important systematic role with respect
to Kant's epistemology, metaphysics and ethics, and indeed, as
relevant to contemporary discussions in these, and related, areas.

Kant's aesthetics and teleology together comprise a very wide field,
and this article cannot cover all the relevant topics, nor take
account of all the relevant literature.  Three limitations should be
mentioned.  First, although Kant wrote on aesthetics and teleology
throughout his career, this article considers only Kant's Critique
of Judgment (along with the so-called First
Introduction, an earlier version of the Introduction which was
not published during Kant's lifetime but which is included with the
most recent English translations of the Critique of
Judgment).  Second, this article is concerned primarily with the
interpretive and philosophical issues raised by Kant's writings on
these topics, as opposed to historical questions regarding their
origin and reception.  Third, the article focusses primarily on those
issues which have attracted most attention in the Anglo-American
analytic tradition; this is reflected in the bibliography, which is
primarily restricted to works in English, and more specifically from
an analytic perspective. For some references to Kant's writings on
aesthetics and teleology other than the Critique of Judgment,
see under Primary Sources in
the Bibliography.  Some suggestions for secondary
literature dealing with the history and reception of Kant's aesthetics
and teleology, and for secondary literature in English from a less
analytic perspective, are given under Secondary
Sources in the Bibliography.

How are synthetic a priori propositions possible? This
question is often times understood to frame the investigations at
issue in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. In answer to it,
Kant saw fit to divide the question into three: 1) How are the
synthetic a priori propositions of mathematics possible? 2)
How are the synthetic a priori propositions of natural
science possible? Finally, 3) How are the synthetic a priori
propositions of metaphysics possible? In systematic fashion, Kant
responds to each of these questions. The answer to question one is
broadly found in the Transcendental Aesthetic, and the doctrine of the
transcendental ideality of space and time. The answer to question two
is found in the Transcendental Analytic, where Kant seeks to
demonstrate the essential role played by the categories in grounding
the possibility of knowledge and experience. The answer to question
three is found in the Transcendental Dialectic, and it is a
resoundingly blunt conclusion: the synthetic a priori
propositions that characterize metaphysics are not really possible at
all. Metaphysics, that is, is inherently
dialectical. Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason is thus as well
known for what it rejects as for what it defends. Thus, in the
Dialectic, Kant turns his attention to the central disciplines of
traditional, rationalist, metaphysics — rational psychology,
rational cosmology, and rational theology. Kant aims to reveal the
errors that plague each of these fields.

Leibniz's Influence on Kant,0.632347822189331,0.4114572703838349,"


Kant’s interest in the physics, metaphysics, epistemology, and
theology of his predecessor G.W. Leibniz is evident in his writings in
the philosophy of natural science as well as in the passages of the
Critique of Pure Reason dealing with transcendental
ideas. The conventional view that Kant sought to steer a middle course
between the rationalism of 18th century German school
philosophy initiated by Leibniz’s follower Christian Wolff and the
empiricism of David Hume furnishes a useful point of departure for
understanding Kant’s intellectual context and his aims and intentions.
However, Kant’s aim in propounding his critical philosophy was not
merely to transcend the stalemate of dogmatism vs. skepticism in
general epistemology, but to address what he regarded as a crisis: the
inability of metaphysics, as taught in the Universities, to secure the
meta-ethical objectivity of morality and the threat to human
confidence and moral discipline posed by the atheism, materialism, and
fatalism of contemporary forms of naturalism. Kant took Leibniz’s as a
failed dogmatic enterprise in metaphysics and philosophical theology,
but as one that was partially redeemed by its parallel treatment of
nature and value. He addressed the Leibnizian topics of the nature of
substance, the human soul and its powers, space, time, and forces,
mechanism and teleology, and divine creation in passages scattered
throughout his major and minor writings.


The main features of Kant’s reception of Leibniz are surveyed below

Kant's Moral Philosophy,0.5454093217849731,0.6076951026916504,"

Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) argued that the supreme principle of
morality is a standard of rationality that he dubbed the
“Categorical Imperative” (CI). Kant characterized the CI
as an objective, rationally necessary and unconditional principle that
we must always follow despite any natural desires or inclinations we
may have to the contrary. All specific moral requirements, according
to Kant, are justified by this principle, which means that all immoral
actions are irrational because they violate the CI. Other
philosophers, such as Hobbes, Locke and Aquinas, had also argued that
moral requirements are based on standards of rationality. However,
these standards were either instrumental principles of rationality for
satisfying one’s desires, as in Hobbes, or external rational
principles that are discoverable by reason, as in Locke and Aquinas.
Kant agreed with many of his predecessors that an analysis of
practical reason reveals the requirement that rational agents must
conform to instrumental principles. Yet he also argued that conformity
to the CI (a non-instrumental principle), and hence to moral
requirements themselves, can nevertheless be shown to be essential to
rational agency. This argument was based on his striking doctrine that
a rational will must be regarded as autonomous, or free, in the sense
of being the author of the law that binds it. The fundamental
principle of morality — the CI — is none other than the
law of an autonomous will. Thus, at the heart of Kant’s moral
philosophy is a conception of reason whose reach in practical affairs
goes well beyond that of a Humean ‘slave’ to the passions.
Moreover, it is the presence of this self-governing reason in each
person that Kant thought offered decisive grounds for viewing each as
possessed of equal worth and deserving of equal respect.

Kant’s most influential positions in moral philosophy are found
in The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (hereafter,
“Groundwork”) but he developed, enriched, and in
some cases modified those views in later works such as The
Critique of Practical Reason, The Metaphysics of Morals,
Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, Religion
within the Boundaries of Mere Reason as well as his essays on
history and related topics. Kant’s Lectures on Ethics,
which were lecture notes taken by three of his students on the courses
he gave in moral philosophy, also include relevant material for
understanding his views. We will mainly focus on the foundational
doctrines of the Groundwork, even though in recent years some
scholars have become dissatisfied with this standard approach to
Kant’s views and have turned their attention to the later works.
We find the standard approach most illuminating, though we will
highlight important positions from the later works where needed.

Kant's Philosophical Development,0.6236701607704163,0.4410658776760101,"
Modern philosophy begins with Kant, and yet he marks the end of the
“Modern” epoch (1600–1800 AD/CE) in the history of
philosophy.[1]
The appearance of the Critique of Pure Reason in 1781 marks
the end of the modern period and the beginning of something entirely
new. Today his texts are read on all continents, and his thought has
had a profound impact on nearly all subsequent philosophical
discussions. The 2004 bicentennial of his death, for instance, was
reflected in conferences in Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany,
Hungary, Japan, Iran, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Paraguay, Poland,
Portugal, Russia, Senegal, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and Turkey.
Like other watershed figures, Kant has contributed to the shape of
world civilization, and the conceptualization we have of the world
today. His practical ideas, such as the Categorical Imperative and its
implications (1785), informed the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (1948), the Political and Economic Covenants (1966), and the
International Criminal Court (2002). His exploration of natural
sciences and his metaphysical ideas, particularly those of his
pre-critical period (1747–1770), are stunning. Kant gave the
first account of the evolutionary reciprocity of spacetime and
momentum-energy, and formulated the first general law of free field
radiation (1747). He suggested the conceptual solution of the three
body problem, which emerges in the interplay of Earth, Moon, and Sun
(1754). He was the first to construct a detailed evolutionary
cosmology (1755). His ideas on biospherical dynamics allowed him to
predict the rhythms of the monsoon and the oscillation of coastal
winds (1755–1757). He suggested that the building blocks of
matter are energy bubbles (1756)—an idea that is useful today in
superstring theory in the guise of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
A number of recent findings have helped to shed more light on
Kant's philosophical development.
First, in terms of science, it now appears that his metaphysics has
withstood the test of time. While traditional scholars largely dismiss
his holistic ontology prior to the Critique, innovations in
the environmental and physical sciences have validated Kant's claims
as realistic insights in the workings of nature. His evolutionary
theory of the universe is now seen as “the essence of modern
models” in cosmology (Coles 2001: 240), and his natural
philosophy is seen as the last milestone of western philosophy prior
to its “comedown” to skepticism (Hawking 2003, 166). In
light of climate change, it stands to reason that Kant's grasp on
biospherical dynamics and sustainable policies may well spur a
philosophical return to Kant in the near future.
Second, in terms of religion, important recent scholarship
indicates an ambivalence, if not dislike of
Christianity—something that his early biographers, all of them
Lutheran theologians, took pains to avoid
revealing.[2]
Kant can be seen as defending pantheism, naturalism, evolution,
cosmic expansion theory and holism, even when doing so was
incompatible with an academic career.
In the 18th Century university system defending such
views often led to dismissal and/or lack of promotion. Kant, himself,
was always cautious when writing on such topics. In the context of
censorship, writers tend to become circumspect. To avoid trouble, they
may publish something anonymously; or they may make oblique remarks
instead of direct statements; or they may have second thoughts and
retract earlier statements. Kant did all three things. But, for later
readers in increasingly secular ages, it is easy to miss Kant's
subtleties and implications.
Third, in terms of culture, Kant's early views may be placed in a
global rather than a purely Western context. Recent research suggests
that key ideas of Kant's natural philosophy also have sources in
Taoist, Buddhist, Hindu and Confucian thought, which were
disseminated in continental Europe by Jesuits based in China,
popularized by Leibniz and Wolff, and further developed by Wolff's
Sinophile student 
Bilfinger.[3]
 One example is the idea of dialectics that
Bilfinger found in the Chinese classics, and which Kant encountered
in the proceedings of the Russian academy.  Importation and serious
consideration of eastern thought was in its infancy during the end of
the modern period, and Kant was unaware of the Far Eastern roots of
the notions that influenced him. The historical irony is that he
dismissed nonwestern cultures while being deeply influenced by their
insights.
Scholars split Kant's development into stages: 

the pre-critical period (1745–1770), during which Kant works
within the tradition of Leibniz/Wolff and writes his impressive early
works on natural phenomena; 
“silent decade” (1770–1781), during which Kant
refrained from publishing texts other than advertisements and
endorsements for classes;
 the critical period (1781–1791), which marks the time of
insights or “the astonishing decade” (Beck 1969: 433) of
his critical philosophy; and 
the post-critical period (1798–1802), often cited as works
of old age.[4] 

 Recent studies indicate that Kant's philosophical development was
far more unified (Schönfeld 2000), and, in terms of its stages,
involved deeper continuities (Edwards 2000) than previously
recognized. From the start, Kant was pushing quite a unique
agenda. Recent scholarship contends Kant's earliest works are not
only commensurate and continuous with his late claims, but also offer
insight into some oddities of the critical period, such as the Third
Analogy of the 
Critique.[5]
 The new picture of Kant's development
indicates that his intellectual trajectory was not as fractured and
erratic as scholarship used to assume, and it also indicates that
Kant was not a late bloomer, but, rather, that he was innovative from
the start.
The following account covers Kant's development from his upbringing
to the critical period. Its theme is his intellectual formation: the
influences in his youth and education; his views on natural
philosophy, ontology and cosmology shaped during his early adulthood;
the questions subsequently pursued; and the historical fate of his
answers.[6]

Kant was a student and a teacher of mathematics throughout his
career, and his reflections on mathematics and mathematical practice
had a profound impact on his philosophical thought. He developed
considered philosophical views on the status of mathematical judgment,
the nature of mathematical definitions, axioms and proof, and the
relation between pure mathematics and the natural world. Moreover, his
approach to the general question “how are synthetic
judgments a priori possible?” was shaped by his
conception of mathematics and its achievements as a well-grounded
science.
Kant's philosophy of mathematics is of interest to a variety of
scholars for multiple reasons. First, his thoughts on mathematics are
a crucial and central component of his critical philosophical system,
and so they are illuminating to the historian of philosophy working on
any aspect of Kant's corpus. Additionally, issues of contemporary
interest and relevance arise from Kant's reflections on the most
fundamental and elementary mathematical disciplines, issues that
continue to inform important questions in the metaphysics and
epistemology of mathematics. Finally, disagreements about how to
interpret Kant's philosophy of mathematics have generated a fertile
area of current research and debate.

Kant's Philosophy of Religion,0.6207708120346069,0.4629656970500946,"


Throughout his career, Immanuel Kant engaged many of the major issues
that contemporary philosophy groups together under the heading
“philosophy of religion.” These include arguments for the
existence of God, the attributes of God, the immortality of the soul,
the problem of evil, and the relationship of moral principles to
religious belief and practice. In the writings from his so-called
“pre-critical” period, i.e., before the publication of the
Critique of Pure Reason in 1781, Kant was interested
principally in the theoretical status and function of the concept of
God. He thus sought to locate the concept of God within a
systematically ordered set of basic philosophical principles that
account for the order and structure of world. In developing his
critical philosophy he proposed a new role for philosophical
principles in understanding the order and structure of the world. As a
result, the critical project had a significant impact upon his
treatment of the status and the role of the concept of God within the
theoretical enterprise of metaphysics. In addition, the critical
philosophy provided a locus from which Kant could address other
important dimensions of the concepts of God and religion more
explicitly than he had done in his earlier writings. Chief among these
are the moral and the religious import that human beings attribute to
the concept of God.  In view of these developments in Kant's thinking
this entry thus will locate his earlier discussions of these topics
within the general philosophical context of his pre-critical period;
it will then reference his treatment of these topics after 1781 to key
elements of his critical project. It will also highlight issues that
remain important for philosophical inquiry into religion. These are
the philosophical function of the concept of God, arguments for the
existence of God, the relationship between morality and religion
(including the notions of “moral faith” and “radical
evil”), and the role of religion in the dynamics of human

Kant's Philosophy of Science,0.6276910901069641,0.4462943375110626,"


Kant's philosophy of science has received attention from several
different audiences and for a variety of reasons. It is of interest to
contemporary philosophers of science primarily because of the way in
which Kant attempts to articulate a philosophical framework that
places substantive conditions on our scientific knowledge of the world
while still respecting the autonomy and diverse claims of particular
sciences. More specifically, Kant develops a philosophy of science
that departs from (i) broadly empiricist views — such as David
Lewis's, according to which purely contingent events in space and time
(along with considerations of simplicity, etc.) determine what the
laws of nature ultimately are — and (ii) certain necessitarian
views — such as David Armstrong's, according to which the laws
of nature consist of necessitation relations between universals, which
place constraints on what events occur in space and time. Kant does so
by holding that (i) scientific laws do involve necessity, but that
(ii) this necessity is based not on (purely metaphysical and hence
inaccessible) relations between universals, but rather on certain
subjective, a priori conditions under which we can experience objects
in space and time.


Kant's scientific writings are also of interest to historians of
modern philosophy, historians of science, and historians of philosophy
of science. Historians of modern philosophy are especially interested
in determining how Kant's views on science might complement or clarify
his distinctive metaphysical and epistemological doctrines (e.g., as
expressed in the Critique of Pure Reason). Historians of
science reflect on the way in which Kant's position fits in with the
views of other natural philosophers of the period, such as Newton and
Leibniz, including his novel account of the formation of the solar
system according to Newtonian principles. Historians of philosophy of
science investigate, among other things, Kant's work in the conceptual
foundations of physics — in particular, his matter theory (e.g.,
the infinite divisibility of matter, attractive and repulsive forces,
inertia, atoms and the void), his theory of motion, and his dynamical
account of the laws of mechanics.


Because physics was Kant's primary (though not exclusive) focus over
the course of his lengthy career, his views on physics during his
pre-Critical (1746-1770), Critical (1781-1790), and Post-Critical
periods (after 1790) will be discussed in separate sections.
Subsections will be devoted to each of the chapters of Kant's most
influential work in philosophy of science, the Metaphysical
Foundations of Natural Science (1786). Kant's basic positions on
other sciences, including psychology, chemistry, and history, will be
presented thereafter.

Kant's Social and Political Philosophy,0.4684892594814301,0.620816707611084,"

Kant wrote his social and political philosophy in order to champion
the Enlightenment in general and the idea of freedom in particular.
His work came within both the natural law and the social contract
traditions. Kant held that every rational being had both an innate
right to freedom and a duty to enter into a civil condition governed
by a social contract in order to realize and preserve that
freedom.

His writings on political philosophy consist of one book and several
shorter works. The “Doctrine of Right”, Part One of his
two-part Metaphysics of Morals and first published as a
stand-alone book in February 1797, contains virtually every directly
political topic he treats. Other shorter works include a useful short
summary of his discussion of the basis and role of the state in the
second section of the essay “Theory and Practice”, an
extended discussion of international relations in the essay
“Toward Perpetual Peace”, and the essay “An Answer
to the Question: What is Enlightenment?.” Other published
material relevant to the topics include material on history, on
practical philosophy in general, and, for his social philosophy, his
work on religion, education, and anthropology. Kant also offered a
biannual lecture course on “Natural Right”, a student’s
(Feyerabend) transcript of which is available in English
translation.

Kant's Theory of Judgment,0.637222409248352,0.4559898972511292,"

Theories of judgment, whether cognitive (i.e.,
object-representing, thought-expressing, truth-apt) judgment or
practical (i.e., act-representing, choice-expressing,
evaluation-apt) judgment, bring together fundamental issues in
semantics, logic, cognitive psychology, and epistemology (collectively
providing for what can be called the four “faces” of
cognitive judgment [see also Martin 2006]), as well as action theory,
moral psychology, and ethics (collectively providing for the three
“faces” of practical judgment): indeed, the notion of
judgment is central to any general theory of human rationality. But
Kant’s theory of judgment differs sharply from many other
theories of judgment, both traditional and contemporary, in three
ways: (1) by taking the innate capacity for judgment to be the
central cognitive faculty of the rational human mind, (2) by
insisting on the semantic, logical, psychological, epistemic, and
practical priority of the propositional content of a
judgment, and (3) by systematically embedding judgment within
the metaphysics of transcendental idealism . Several serious
problems are generated by the interplay of the first two factors with
the third. This in turn suggests that the other two parts of
Kant’s theory of judgment can be logically detached from the
strongest version of his transcendental idealism and defended
independently of it. This entry also includes five supplementary
documents covering (i) the debate about Kant’s conceptualism vs.
Kant’s non-conceptualism, (ii) the epistemology of Kantian
judgment and the ethics of Kantian belief, (iii) Kant’s logic in
relation to his theory of judgment, (iv) kinds of use for judgments,
and (v) completing the picture of Kant’s metaphysics of
judgment.

Kant's Transcendental Arguments,0.6489226222038269,0.45304858684539795,"


Among Immanuel Kant’s (1724–1804) most influential
contributions to philosophy is his development of the transcendental
argument.  In Kant’s conception, an argument of this kind begins
with a compelling premise about our thought, experience, or knowledge,
and then reasons to a conclusion that is a substantive and unobvious
presupposition and necessary condition of this premise. The crucial
steps in this reasoning are claims to the effect that a subconclusion
or conclusion is a presupposition and necessary condition of a
premise. Such a necessary condition might be a logically necessary
condition, but often in Kant’s transcendental arguments the
condition is necessary in the sense that it is the only possible
explanation for the premise, whereupon the necessity might be weaker
than logical. Typically, this reasoning is intended to be a
priori in some sense, either strict (Smit 1999) or more relaxed
(Philip Kitcher 1981, Pereboom 1990). The conclusion of the argument
is often directed against skepticism of some sort. For example,
Kant’s Transcendental Deduction targets Humean skepticism about
the applicability of a priori metaphysical concepts, and his
Refutation of Idealism takes aim at skepticism about external
objects. These two transcendental arguments are found in
the Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), but such arguments
are found throughout Kant’s writings, for example in
the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), in
the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), in the Critique
of the Power of Judgment (1790), and in the Opus
Posthumum (1804; Förster 1989). This article focuses on the
Transcendental Deduction, the Refutation of Idealism, and more recent
transcendental arguments that are inspired by Kant’s work.

Even though Kant himself held that his view of the mind and
consciousness were inessential to his main purpose, some of his ideas
came to have an enormous influence on his successors. Ideas central to
his view are now central to cognitive science. Other ideas equally
central to his point of view had almost no influence on subsequent
work, however. In this article, first we survey Kant's model as a whole
and the claims that have been influential. Then we examine his claims
about consciousness of self specifically. Many of his ideas about the
consciousness of self and related issues have not been influential.
Indeed, even though he achieved remarkable insights into consciousness
of self, they next appeared only 200 years later, in the 1960s and
1970s.

Kant's Views on Space and Time,0.634958803653717,0.4300680458545685,"

Even a casual reader of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason
(Kritik der reinen Vernunft, first published in 1781) will notice the
prominence he gives to his discussion of space and time. So the reader
will not be surprised to learn that scholars consider this discussion
to be central to Kant’s so-called critical philosophy. Given Kant’s
reputation for developing difficult, not to say obscure, philosophical
views, it will also not surprise the reader to learn that there is no
consensus on how Kant’s conception of space and time ought to be
characterized and explicated. So the goal of this entry is to bring
some clarity to Kant’s views by situating them historically and
philosophically within the milieu of some central debates concerning
space and time in the early modern period, especially the rich century
between the first edition of Newton’s Principia mathematica,
which was first published in 1687, and the publication of the second
edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, which occurred
exactly a hundred years later. The difficulty of comprehending Kant’s
views gives interpreters a reason to place a special emphasis on
context—I will especially highlight Kant’s reactions to his most
significant predecessors in this area, Leibniz and Newton. The focus
throughout will be on Kant’s magnum opus, the Critique of Pure
Reason. Following tradition, and to some extent Kant’s own lead,
the focus will also be on space and on our representation of space,
although parallel points concerning time (and its representation) will
sometimes be indicated.

In what follows, the Critique of Pure Reason is cited by the
usual A/B method; other references are to Kants gesammelte
Schriften (via “Ak” [for Akademie edition] followed

Harry A. Wolfson once described medieval philosophy as a philosophy
“which placed itself at the service of Scriptures”
(Philo, II, p. 439). From a formal aspect, a new genre was
created: “From now on, a new form of exposition appears in
philosophic literature, the homily on some scriptural text or the
running commentary upon some scriptural books” (p. 444). Joseph
ibn Kaspi is a perfect illustration of this characterization of the
medieval philosopher. He wrote some thirty works dedicated to
explaining the Bible, in which philosophy served him both as a method
and as a compendium of philosophical conclusions which, to his mind,
the biblical author had wanted to convey to the reader. Some of
Kaspi's works were devoted to logic and linguistics as methods
suitable for biblical exegesis; others were commentaries on books of
the Bible or supercommentaries, and he also wrote on theological
subjects. Of this vast oeuvre, only some has been published; much
remains in manuscript, and some works have apparently been lost.

Johannes Kepler,0.7959806323051453,0.15078848600387573,"


Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) is one of the most significant
representatives of the so-called Scientific Revolution of the
16th and 17th centuries. Although he received
only the basic training of a “magister” and was
professionally oriented towards theology at the beginning of his
career, he rapidly became known for his mathematical skills and
theoretical creativity. As a convinced Copernican, Kepler was able to
defend the new system on different fronts: against the old astronomers
who still sustained the system of Ptolemy, against the Aristotelian
natural philosophers, against the followers of the new “mixed
system” of Tycho Brahe—whom Kepler succeeded as Imperial
Mathematician in Prague—and even against the standard Copernican
position according to which the new system was to be considered merely
as a computational device and not necessarily a physical
reality. Kepler's complete corpus can be hardly summarized as a
“system” of ideas like scholastic philosophy or the new
Cartesian systems which arose in the second half of the 17th
century. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify two main tendencies,
one linked to Platonism and giving priority to the role of geometry in
the structure of the world, the other connected with the Aristotelian
tradition and accentuating the role of experience and causality in
epistemology. While he attained immortal fame in astronomy because of
his three planetary laws, Kepler also made fundamental contributions
in the fields of optics and mathematics. To the little-known facts
regarding Kepler’s indefatigable scientific activity belong his
efforts to develop different technical devices, for instance, a water
pump, which he tried to patent and apply in different practical
contexts (for the documents, see KGW 21.2.2., pp. 509–57 and
667–691). To his contemporaries he was also a famous
mathematician and astrologer; for his own part, he wanted to be
considered a philosopher who investigated the innermost structure of
the cosmos scientifically.

The Analysis of Knowledge,0.7251445055007935,0.7220122218132019,"

For any person, there are some things they know, and some things they
don’t. What exactly is the difference? What does it take to know
something? It’s not enough just to believe it—we
don’t know the things we’re wrong about. Knowledge seems
to be more like a way of getting at the truth. The analysis of
knowledge concerns the attempt to articulate in what exactly this kind
of “getting at the truth” consists.

More particularly, the project of analysing knowledge is to state
conditions that are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for
propositional knowledge, thoroughly answering the question, what does
it take to know something? By “propositional knowledge”,
we mean knowledge of a proposition—for example, if Susan knows
that Alyssa is a musician, she has knowledge of the proposition that
Alyssa is a musician. Propositional knowledge should be distinguished
from knowledge of “acquaintance”, as obtains when Susan
knows Alyssa. The relation between propositional knowledge and the
knowledge at issue in other “knowledge” locutions in
English, such as knowledge-where (“Susan knows where she
is”) and especially knowledge-how (“Susan knows how to
ride a bicycle”) is subject to some debate (see Stanley 2011 and
his opponents discussed therein).

The propositional knowledge that is the analysandum of the analysis of
knowledge literature is paradigmatically expressed in English by
sentences of the form “S knows that p”,
where “S” refers to the knowing subject, and
“p” to the proposition that is known. A proposed
analysis consists of a statement of the following form: S knows
that p if and only if j, where j indicates the
analysans: paradigmatically, a list of conditions that are
individually necessary and jointly sufficient for S to have
knowledge that p.

It is not enough merely to pick out the actual extension of knowledge.
Even if, in actual fact, all cases of S knowing that p
are cases of j, and all cases of the latter are cases of the
former, j might fail as an analysis of knowledge. For example,
it might be that there are possible cases of knowledge
without j, or vice versa. A proper analysis of knowledge should
at least be a necessary truth. Consequently, hypothetical thought
experiments provide appropriate test cases for various analyses, as we
shall see below.

Even a necessary biconditional linking knowledge to some state
j would probably not be sufficient for an analysis of
knowledge, although just what more is required is a matter of some
controversy. According to some theorists, to analyze knowledge is
literally to identify the components that make up
knowledge—compare a chemist who analyzes a sample to learn its
chemical composition. On this interpretation of the project of
analyzing knowledge, the defender of a successful analysis of
knowledge will be committed to something like the metaphysical claim
that what it is for S to know p is for some
list of conditions involving S and p to obtain. Other
theorists think of the analysis of knowledge as distinctively
conceptual—to analyse knowledge is to limn the
structure of the concept of knowledge. On one version of this
approach, the concept knowledge is literally composed of more
basic concepts, linked together by something like Boolean operators.
Consequently, an analysis is subject not only to extensional accuracy,
but to facts about the cognitive representation of knowledge and other
epistemic notions. In practice, many epistemologists engaging in the
project of analyzing knowledge leave these metaphilosophical
interpretive questions unresolved; attempted analyses, and
counterexamples thereto, are often proposed without its being made
explicit whether the claims are intended as metaphysical or conceptual
ones. In many cases, this lack of specificity may be legitimate, since
all parties tend to agree that an analysis of knowledge ought at
least to be extensionally correct in all metaphysically possible
worlds. As we shall see, many theories have been defended and,
especially, refuted, on those terms.

The attempt to analyze knowledge has received a considerable amount of
attention from epistemologists, particularly in the late
20th Century, but no analysis has been widely accepted.
Some contemporary epistemologists reject the assumption that knowledge
is susceptible to analysis.

Knowledge by Acquaintance vs. Description,0.7100962400436401,0.6940169930458069,"
The terminology is most clearly associated with Bertrand Russell,
but the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by
description is arguably a critical component of classical or
traditional versions of foundationalism.  Let us say that one has
inferential or nonfoundational knowledge that p when one's
knowledge that p depends on one's knowledge of some other
proposition(s) from which one can legitimately infer p; and
one has foundational or noninferential knowledge that p when
one's knowledge that p does not depend on any other knowledge
one has in this way.  According to foundationalism regarding
knowledge, we have some foundational knowledge, and any
nonfoundational or inferential knowledge that we have depends,
ultimately, on this foundational knowledge. What distinguishes
classical foundationalism (or at least a prominent version of
classical foundationalism) about knowledge is the insistence that all
foundational knowledge is knowledge by acquaintance. 
Historically, the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and
knowledge by description is made between two kinds
of knowledge. However, after a brief discussion of Russell's
presentation of the distinction, we follow the contemporary literature
in focusing more on the role of acquaintance in
securing justified or rational belief.  (See the
entry on
 epistemology
for more on the relation between knowledge and justification.) This is
important both because doing so can illuminate the role that
acquaintance plays in securing knowledge (which arguably requires
justified belief) and because we may be interested in its role as a
source of justification even when we fall short of knowledge. Let us
say that one has an inferentially justified belief that p
when one's belief that p depends for its justification on
justified belief in some other proposition(s) from which one can
legitimately infer p; and one has a foundationally or
noninferentially justified belief that p when one's belief
that p is justified but does not depend on any other beliefs
for its justification. According to foundationalism regarding
justification, we have some foundationally justified beliefs, and all
other justified beliefs must depend for their justification on
foundationally justified beliefs.  Classical versions of
foundationalism about justification hold that foundational beliefs are
justified by acquaintance. (See the entry on
 foundationalist theories of epistemic justification
for more on foundationalism.)  As we shall see, proponents of
classical foundationalism typically ascribe other important
philosophical roles to acquaintance.

In philosophy, “self-knowledge” standardly refers to
knowledge of one’s own sensations, thoughts, beliefs, and other
mental states. At least since Descartes, most philosophers have
believed that our knowledge of our own mental states differs markedly
from our knowledge of the external world (where this includes our
knowledge of others’ thoughts). But there is little agreement
about what precisely distinguishes self-knowledge from knowledge in
other realms. Partially because of this disagreement, philosophers
have endorsed competing accounts of how we acquire
self-knowledge. These accounts have important consequences for a broad
range of philosophical issues, especially issues in epistemology and
the philosophy of mind.

mental states. A separate topic sometimes referred to as

The value of knowledge has always been a central topic within
epistemology. Going all the way back to Plato’s Meno,
philosophers have asked, why is knowledge more valuable than mere true
belief? Interest in this question has grown in recent years, with
theorists proposing a range of answers. But some reject the premise of
the question and claim that the value of knowledge is
‘swamped’ by the value of true belief. And others argue
that statuses other than knowledge, such as justification or
understanding, are distinctively valuable. We will call the general
question of why knowledge is valuable the value problem.

Knowledge How,0.7600173354148865,0.4794168770313263,"


It is common in epistemology to distinguish among three kinds of
knowledge. There's the kind of knowledge you have when it
is truly said of you that you know how to do something—say,
ride a bicycle. There's the kind of knowledge you have when
it is truly said of you that you know a person—say, your best
friend. And there's the kind of knowledge you have when it
is truly said of you that you know that some fact is true—say,
that the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series. Here we will be
concerned with the first and last of these kinds. The first is
usually called “knowledge-how” and the last is usually
called “knowledge-that” or “propositional
knowledge.”


Debates about knowledge-how revolve around two main issues.  First,
there are debates about the degree to which knowledge-how is
independent of knowledge-that. Is to know how to do something just to
know lots of facts (of the right sort)? To exercise knowledge-how,
must an act be preceded by some implicit or explicit consideration of
a fact about how to do it? Since Gilbert Ryle's seminal (1949)
presentation of the issue, the majority opinion in academic philosophy
is that there is a considerable degree of independence. Knowledge-how
and knowledge-that are distinct kinds; to know how to do something is
not just to know the right facts about how to do it, and to exercise
knowledge-how you need not first implicitly or explicitly consider a
fact about how to do it. The view that knowledge-how and
knowledge-that are independent in this way is usually, following Ryle,
called anti-intellectualism. The view that they are
dependent—that to know how to do something is just to know the
right sort of fact or that to exercise know-how requires a prior
implicit or explicit consideration of a proposition—is called
intellectualism. There is also a more radical form of
anti-intellectualism according to which to know that something is the
case is to have a certain kind of knowledge-how.  I'll use the label
“moderate anti-intellectualism” for the less radical
version.


Second, there are debates about exactly what knowledge-how consists
in. The intellectualist can provide one answer—knowledge-how
consists in the knowledge that certain propositions are true. If not
that, what? The main anti-intellectualist answers—sometimes not
clearly enough distinguished—are that knowledge-how consists in
some sort of ability and that knowledge-how consists in some sort of
disposition. In this entry I will outline the main views about what
knowledge-how might consist in, discuss how these views point us
either toward intellectualism or anti-intellectualism, and present the
main difficulties that have been offered against each account.

a break with several key positivist doctrines, but also inaugurated a
new style of philosophy of science that brought it closer to the
history of science. His account of the development of science held
that science enjoys periods of stable growth punctuated by revisionary
revolutions. To this thesis, Kuhn added the controversial
‘incommensurability thesis’, that theories from differing
periods suffer from certain deep kinds of failure of
comparability.

Kumārila,0.7485390901565552,0.34689176082611084,"


Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, who likely flourished around 660
ce, was a proponent of the orthodox
Brahmanical school of Pūrva Mīmāṃsā. Among
the most influential thinkers in the history of Indian philosophy, he
made significant contributions regarding the full range of issues that
follow from that school's constitutive concern with Vedic authority
and exegesis; virtually all Indian philosophers writing subsequent to
him—and particularly Buddhist philosophers, whose positions were
most completely antithetical to his—found it necessary to reckon
especially with his arguments regarding epistemology and philosophy of
language. Among the areas in which he exercised lasting influence are
hermeneutics, poetics, jurisprudence, and (arguably) historiography.
Chief among the doctrines that have recently occasioned philosophical
interest in him is that of svataḥ
prāmāṇya—“intrinsic
reliability,” or immediate justification—which
surely represents Kumārila's most significant epistemological
contribution; occasionally dismissed as fundamentalist in spirit, this
has come to be appreciated (sometimes in light of the “reformed
epistemology” advanced by contemporary thinkers such as William
Alston and Nicholas Wolterstorff) as a cogent working-out of the kinds
of commonsensical epistemic intuitions characteristic of Thomas
Reid. Together with a robust realism about linguistic universals and
the peculiarly Mīmāṃsaka conviction that the Vedic
texts are eternal, this epistemology was effectively deployed by
Kumārila to show that a commitment to the uniquely authoritative
status of the Vedas (and to the ritual practices enjoined thereby) was
rationally held.

Jacques Marie Émile Lacan (April 13, 1901 to September 9, 1981)
was a major figure in Parisian intellectual life for much of the
twentieth century. Sometimes referred to as “the French
Freud,” he is an important figure in the history of
psychoanalysis. His teachings and writings explore the significance of
Freud’s discovery of the unconscious both within the theory and
practice of analysis itself as well as in connection with a wide range
of other disciplines.  Particularly for those interested in the
philosophical dimensions of Freudian thought, Lacan’s oeuvre
is invaluable.  Over the course of the past fifty-plus years, Lacanian
ideas have become central to the various receptions of things
psychoanalytic in Continental philosophical circles especially.

Imre Lakatos,0.8939712047576904,0.529558539390564,"

Imre Lakatos (1922–1974) was a Hungarian-born philosopher of
mathematics and science who rose to prominence in Britain, having fled
his native land in 1956 when the Hungarian Uprising was suppressed by
Soviet tanks. He was notable for his anti-formalist philosophy of
mathematics (where “formalism” is not just the philosophy
of Hilbert and his followers but also comprises logicism and
intuitionism) and for his “Methodology of Scientific Research
Programmes” or MSRP, a radical revision of Popper’s
Demarcation Criterion between science and non-science which gave rise
to a novel theory of scientific rationality.

Although he lived and worked in London, rising to the post of
Professor of Logic at the London School of Economics (LSE), Lakatos
never became a British citizen, but died a stateless person. Despite
the star-studded array of academic lords and knights who were willing
to testify on his behalf, neither MI5 nor the Special Branch seem to
have trusted him, and no less a person than Roy Jenkins, the then Home
Secretary, signed off on the refusal to naturalize him. (See Bandy
2009: ch. 16, which includes the transcripts of successive
interrogations.)

Nonetheless, Lakatos’s influence, particularly in the philosophy
of science, has been immense. According to Google Scholar, by the
25th of January 2015, that is, just twenty-five days into
the new year, thirty-three papers had been published citing
Lakatos in that year alone, a citation rate of over one paper
per day. Introductory texts on the Philosophy of Science typically
include substantial sections on Lakatos, some admiring, some critical,
and many an admixture of the two (see for example Chalmers 2013 and
Godfrey-Smith 2003). The premier prize for the best book in the
Philosophy of Science (funded by the foundation of a wealthy and
academically distinguished disciple, Spiro Latsis) is named in his
honour. Moreover, Lakatos is one of those philosophers whose influence
extends well beyond the confines of academic philosophy. Of the
thirty-three papers citing Lakatos published in the first twenty-five
days of 2015, at most ten qualify as straight philosophy. The
rest are devoted to such topics as educational theory, international
relations, public policy research (with special reference to the
development of technology), informatics, design science, religious
studies, clinical psychology, social economics, political economy,
mathematics, the history of physics and the sociology of the family.
Thus Imre Lakatos was very much more than a philosophers’
philosopher.

First, we discuss Lakatos’s life in relation to his works.
Lakatos’s Hungarian career has now become a big issue in the
critical literature. This is partly because of disturbing facts about
Lakatos’s early life that have only come to light in the West
since his death, and partly because of a dispute between the
“Hungarian” and the “English” interpreters of
Lakatos’s thought, between those writers (not all of them
Magyars) who take the later Lakatos to be much more of a Hegelian (and
perhaps much more of a disciple of György Lukács) than he
liked to let on, and those who take his Hegelianism to be an
increasingly residual affair, not much more, in the end, than a habit
of “coquetting” with Hegelian expressions (Marx,
Capital: 103). Just as there are analytic Marxists who think
that Marx’s thought can be rationally reconstructed without the
Hegelian coquetry and dialectical Marxists who think that it cannot,
so also there are analytic Lakatosians who think that Lakatos’s
thought can be largely reconstructed without the Hegelian coquetry and
dialectical Lakatosians who think that it cannot (see for instance
Kadvany 2001 and Larvor 1998). Obviously, we cannot settle the matter
in an Encyclopedia entry but we hope to say enough to illuminate the
issue. (Spoiler alert: so far as the Philosophy of Science is
concerned, we tend to favor the English interpretation. We are more
ambivalent with respect to the Philosophy of Mathematics.)

Secondly we discuss Lakatos’s big ideas, the two contributions
that constitute his chief claims to fame as a philosopher, before
moving on (thirdly) to a more detailed discussion of some of his
principal papers. We conclude with a section on the Feyerabend/Lakatos
Debate. Lakatos was a provocative and combative thinker, and it
falsifies his thought to present it as less controversial (and perhaps
less outrageous) than it actually was.

Note: In referring to Lakatos’s chief works (and to a couple of
Popper’s) we have employed a set of acronyms rather than the
name/date system, hoping that this will be more perspicuous to
readers. The acronyms are explained in the Bibliography.

The \(\lambda\)-calculus is, at heart, a simple notation for functions
and application. The main ideas are applying a function to an
argument and forming functions by abstraction. The syntax of
basic \(\lambda\)-calculus is quite sparse, making it an elegant, focused
notation for representing functions. Functions and arguments are on a
par with one another. The result is a non-extensional theory of
functions as rules of computation, contrasting with an extensional
theory of functions as sets of ordered pairs. Despite its sparse
syntax, the expressiveness and flexibility of the \(\lambda\)-calculus
make it a cornucopia of logic and mathematics. This entry develops
some of the central highlights of the field and prepares the reader
for further study of the subject and its applications in philosophy,
linguistics, computer science, and logic.

Friedrich Albert Lange,0.8430301547050476,0.5381065607070923,"

Friedrich Albert Lange (b. 1828, d. 1875) was a German philosopher,
pedagogist, political activist, and journalist. Lange is a significant
figure among the mid nineteenth century German intellectuals who were
concerned to think through the impact of developments in natural
science for philosophy, pedagogy, and politics. 

Lange was one of the originators of “physiological
neo-Kantianism” and an important figure in the founding of the
Marburg school of neo-Kantianism. He played a significant role in the
German labour movement and in the development of social democratic
thought. He articulated a socialist Darwinism that was an alternative
to early social Darwinism. His work The History of Materialism and
Critique of its Contemporary Significance was a classic text in
materialism and the history of philosophy well into the twentieth
century. The “materialism controversy” (see Beiser 2014a,
chapter 9, and 2014b, chapter 2) centered on the impact of materialist
science and philosophy on religion and metaphysics. Lange’s
response to the materialism controversy had an influence on the
neo-Kantian movement and on Friedrich Nietzsche, among others. His
work in logic, culminating in the Logical Studies, derived
the syllogistic from diagrammatic reasoning, and was admired by Ernst
Schröder and John Venn.

Lange’s sympathetic critique of materialism, his philosophical
naturalism, and his political activism unite his diverse achievements,
and distinguish him among nineteenth century philosophers.

The Language of Thought Hypothesis,0.7984188795089722,0.4281589388847351,"


The Language of Thought Hypothesis (LOTH) postulates that thought and
thinking take place in a mental language. This language consists of a
system of representations that is physically realized in the brain of
thinkers and has a combinatorial syntax (and semantics) such that
operations on representations are causally sensitive only to the
syntactic properties of representations. According to LOTH, thought is,
roughly, the tokening of a representation that has a syntactic
(constituent) structure with an appropriate semantics. Thinking thus
consists in syntactic operations defined over such representations.
Most of the arguments for LOTH derive their strength from their ability
to explain certain empirical phenomena like productivity and
systematicity of thought and thinking.

Large Cardinals and Determinacy,0.932843804359436,0.7423431277275085,"

The developments of set theory in 1960's led to an era of independence
in which many of the central questions were shown to be unresolvable
on the basis of the standard system of mathematics, ZFC. This is true
of statements from areas as diverse as analysis (“Are all
projective sets Lebesgue measurable?”), cardinal arithmetic
(“Does Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis (CH) hold?”),
combinatorics (“Does Suslin's Hypotheses hold?”), and
group theory (“Is there a Whitehead group?”). 

 These developments gave rise to two conflicting positions. The
first position—which we shall
call pluralism—maintains that the independence results
largely undermine the enterprise of set theory as an objective
enterprise. On this view, although there are practical
reasons that one might give in favour of one set of axioms over
another—say, that it is more useful for a given task—,
there are no theoretical reasons that can be given; and,
moreover, this either implies or is a consequence of the
fact—depending on the variant of the view, in particular,
whether it places realism before reason, or conversely—that
there is no objective mathematical realm at this level. The second
position—which we shall
call non-pluralism—maintains that the independence
results merely indicate the paucity of our standard resources for
justifying mathematical statements. On this view, theoretical
reasons can be given for new axioms and—again,
depending on the variant of the view—this either implies or is a
consequence of the fact that there is an objective mathematical realm
at this level. 

 The theoretical reasons for new axioms that the non-pluralist
gives are quite different that the theoretical reasons that are
customarily at play in mathematics, in part because, having stepped
into the realm of independence, a more subtle form of justification is
required, one that relies more heavily on sophisticated mathematical
machinery. The dispute between the pluralist and the non-pluralist is
thus one that lies at the intersection of philosophy and
mathematics—on the one hand, it is intimately connected with
some of the central questions of philosophy of mathematics, such as
the question of realism and the nature of justification; on the other
hand, it addresses these questions in a manner that is sensitive to a
great deal of sophisticated mathematics. 

 The debate between the pluralist and the non-pluralist is really a
hierarchy of debates. At the one extreme there is pluralism with
regard to all of mathematics and at the other extreme there
is non-pluralism with regard to all of mathematics. The
intermediate positions (which are much more common) involve embracing
non-pluralism for certain domains (say first-order arithmetic), while
advocating pluralism with regard to others (say those where the notion
of the full powerset enters the picture). Fortunately, the
mathematical systems that arise in practice can be arranged in a
well-founded hierarchy—ranging from weak systems like Robinson's
arithmetic Q, up through Peano arithmetic PA, the subsystems of
second-order arithmetic, the subsystems of set theory, and the
hierarchy of large cardinal axioms. One can thus arrange the hybrid
non-pluralist/pluralist positions and the corresponding debates in a
well-founded hierarchy, where along the way one embraces more and more
non-pluralism. The challenge for those with non-pluralist tendencies
is to make the case that non-pluralism extends further and further
into the upper reaches of higher mathematics. The challenge for those
with pluralist tendencies is to draw the line in a principled manner
and make the case that no argument for non-pluralism will succeed for
the domains of mathematics beyond that line. 

 It is sensible to approach the search for new axioms and the
question of pluralism in a stepwise fashion, seeking first axioms that
resolve certain low-level questions and making the case for
non-pluralism at that level, and then proceeding upward to questions
of greater complexity and the question of pluralism at higher
levels. The present entry focuses on this debate as it takes place in
the setting of classical descriptive set theory. There are
three reasons for this choice. First, a popular view embraces
non-pluralism for first-order arithmetic but rejects the search for
new axioms for full second-order arithmetic and set theory and
embraces pluralism at these 
 levels.[1] 
 The questions of descriptive set theory are
important in this connection since many of them are statements of
second-order arithmetic which are independent of the standard axioms,
ZFC. It thus represents a critical juncture in the debate between the
pluralist and non-pluralist. Second, here the mathematical landscape
with regard to the implications of new axioms has largely stabilized
and we now have the resources required to address the issue between
the pluralist and the non-pluralist. (In the case of questions of
third- and higher-order arithmetic the matter still awaits further
mathematical developments. That topic is treated in the entry
 “The Continuum Hypothesis”.)  
Finally, the case for new axioms at this level involves so-called
“extrinsic justifications” (something we shall describe
below) and, moreover, provides the strongest current example of such
justifications. 

 Here is an overview of the present
entry: Section 1 provides further philosophical
motivation and sharpens the question of pluralism by briefly
discussing the interpretability hierarchy, the incompleteness
phenomenon, and the nature of axioms.
 Section 2
 describes the central notions and results of classical
descriptive set theory along with the independence results concerning
the questions that remained open and were ultimately shown to be
unresolvable on the basis of the standard axioms,
ZFC. Section 3 describes the two main
approaches to new axioms—axioms of definable determinacy and
large cardinal axioms—and discusses the implications of these
axioms for the undecided questions of classical descriptive set
theory. Section 4 treats of the intimate
relationship between the two approaches and outlines the case that has
been made for axioms of definable determinacy and large cardinal
axioms. Section 5 revisits the debate between
the pluralist and the non-pluralist in light of the foregoing
mathematical developments.

Latin American Philosophy,0.5993873476982117,0.5585960745811462,"


In its most expansive sense, Latin American philosophy is philosophy
produced in Latin America or philosophy produced by persons of Latin
American ancestry who reside outside of Latin America. It is typically
taken to exclude philosophy produced in non-Iberian former colonies,
with the occasional exception of former French colonies in the
Caribbean. Other names have also been used to refer to the whole or
part of Latin American philosophy, including Spanish American, Hispanic
American, Iberoamerican, and Latino/a philosophy. The first two refer
specifically to the philosophy of former Spanish colonies, the third to
that of former Iberian colonies, and the fourth to the philosophy
produced in the United States by descendants of Latin Americans.


Latin American philosophy is usually taken to have originated around
1550, when Spanish conquerors founded the first schools in Latin
America and began to teach and publish philosophical treatises.
Recently, there has been an effort on the part of historians to
include pre-Columbian thought in Latin American philosophy, although
the pre-Columbian texts cited are often fragmentary and religious in
tone and intention. In terms of traditions, style, and influence,
post-Columbian Latin American philosophy is part of the Western
philosophical tradition. Indeed, philosophical discussions in Latin
America have and continue to be dominated by European philosophical
influences. Even those Latin American philosophers who have endeavored
to develop original theories have frequently framed their own
contributions in the terms of European thinkers. Partly in response to
this phenomenon, there has arisen a large body of literature concerned
with the identity, authenticity, and originality of Latin American
philosophy.


Latin American philosophy has been both original and derivative. Much
of its history involves work that is derivative of European
philosophical figures and movements. At the same, time Latin American
philosophy has produced important philosophers, original approaches to
old philosophical problems, and formulations of new problems not
already within the European philosophical tradition. Moreover,
virtually all historical European philosophical traditions have been
present in Latin America, as are most contemporary movements in the
United States and Europe. Finally, there has been a significant
interest in social concerns among Latin American philosophers, partly
as a reaction to the social and economic circumstances of Latin
America. This has led Latin American philosophical work to be
comparatively more concerned with social issues than philosophy in,
for example, the United States.


The influence of Latin American philosophy outside of Latin America
has thus far been relatively small. Although the situation has been
improving, very few Latin American philosophers are currently read
outside of Latin America. This situation is made worse by the paucity
of English-language translations of Latin American philosophical
works. Moreover, internal to Latin America, philosophers read and
respond to each other with less frequency than one might expect or
wish. However, the philosophy of liberation has had some impact both
in North America and in developing countries in Africa, and Latinos/as
have participated actively in the discussion of a variety of topics,
especially those having to do with race, ethnicity, and social
identities in the United States. In the past few years, some of these
philosophers have occupied positions of leadership in the
philosophical establishment and their work has been the subject of
discussion by prominent non-Latino/a philosophers.


This article is divided into three main parts: history, the
contemporary period, and problems and topics. We begin with a sketch of
the history of Latin American philosophy.

Liberalism in Latin America,0.4529610276222229,0.6510139107704163,"

Liberalism was the dominant political discourse in Latin America
during most of the nineteenth century. Initially, in the first half of
the century, it was a discourse of liberation from colonial rule in
Hispanic America. Later, in the second half, liberalism was firmly
established as an ideology of nation building in most of the region.
However, by the mid twentieth century, liberalism had mostly vanished
from the political scene, except for the case of Colombia where the
liberal party continued to be a live political option until the end of
the century. Despite the fact that it became the dominant political
discourse in the nineteenth century, there is no such thing as Latin
American or Hispanic American “liberalism”, if by the
latter we mean something like a unified and internally coherent
political theory. Instead, what emerged in the nineteenth century was
a political movement that can appropriately be called
“liberal” to the extent that political actors either
espoused liberal ideas or identified themselves as
“liberals”, or both. Though such a political movement
began to take shape in the aftermath of the wars of independence from
Spain and Portugal, self-identification as a member of a liberal group
became possible around the mid-century when the liberal position
became more definite in relation to the conservative political
opposition.

A difficulty for the reconstruction of liberalism in Latin America
lies in the fact that political actors primarily employed liberal
ideas in order to press for specific political ends but were not
greatly concerned with systematic theorizing. Liberal intellectuals
were public figures who engaged in the task of advocating liberal
ideas in order to transform their new societies in light of them. They
were mainly concerned with the practical tasks of constitutional
design and institutional reform. Thus, the liberal movement emerged
mainly in political and legal practice, not in theoretical works.
Liberal intellectuals expressed and developed their views in the
numerous constitutions that they produced, in legal commentary, and in
the public debates that took place in pamphlets and newspapers. This
may be the reason why the reconstruction of Latin American nineteenth
century liberalism has been dominated by historians, while
philosophers and political theorists have been mostly absent.
Nevertheless, this reconstruction is also of philosophical interest
for at least two reasons. First, the most prominent liberal
intellectuals, such as Juan Bautista Alberdi in Argentina, José
María Luis Mora in Mexico, and José Victorino Lastarria
in Chile, did develop distinctive liberal positions that are worth
examining. Alberdi and Lastarria, in particular, also produced
theoretical works in which they systematized their own political
convictions. Second, though it is not straightforward to identify what
exactly was meant by “liberalism” in each region at each
particular time since public intellectuals expressed a plurality of
views, it is not difficult to see that distinctively liberal positions
developed in response to local political problems. In the various
regions of Latin America, liberalism developed in different directions
according to the political problems that political actors considered
most pressing. Since what was meant by “liberalism” turns
out to be sometimes surprising from a contemporary perspective, the
consideration of nineteenth century Latin American liberalism can
contribute to enrich our current understanding of liberalism as a far
more internally heterogeneous ideology than is usually assumed.

In light of the variety and complexity of Latin American liberal
views, this entry provides only a brief and general introduction to
the topic that is far from being the whole story. Since the heyday of
Latin American liberalism took place in the nineteenth century, this
entry privileges this historical period, though the last section
focuses on the decline of liberalism in the twentieth century and its
modest revival in recent decades. In order to adequately present the
liberal political movement, it has been indispensable to provide the
highlights of the social and political context that motivated the
initial enthusiastic appropriation of liberal ideas as well as their
further development. This entry also provides closer though brief
approximations to the views developed by the most prominent liberal
intellectuals mentioned earlier, namely, Alberdi, Mora, and Lastarria.
Since they articulated their own views in quite different political
contexts, their respective liberal views differ greatly from each
other. Though the entry is organized thematically, it also roughly
follows a chronological order. The first section offers a brief
overview. The second section presents the influence of Spanish
liberalism in the initial reception of liberal ideas around the time
of the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. The third
section presents early Hispanic American liberalism as an emancipatory
ideology that commanded wide acceptance among the elites. The fourth
section considers the transition from the initial constitutional
optimism to the search for alternative ways for bringing about the
much desired social and political change. The fifth section focuses on
the ideological conflict between liberals and conservatives around the
mid-nineteenth century. It was in the midst of this conflict that the
liberal faction acquired a specific political identity. The sixth
section presents the liberal anticlerical response to the religious
problem. The seventh section considers the influence of positivism and
the triumph of liberalism as an ideology of nation building. The final
section briefly considers the decline of liberalism in the early
decades of the twentieth century.

Skepticism in Latin America,0.6133908629417419,0.5858315825462341,"

This entry examines the development and impact of the study of
philosophical skepticism throughout Latin America. It also highlights
some significant trends and important contributions made to this
venerable tradition by a number of Latin American philosophers.

Skepticism is a philosophical activity of investigation characterized
by the notion of suspension of judgment. Whereas dogmatists affirm or
deny a proposition on a given philosophical topic, skeptics neither
affirm nor deny any proposition, i. e., they remain uncommitted to any
dogmatic doctrine. According to skeptics, the basic opposition in
philosophy is that between those who endorse a philosophical theory
and those who, after having inquired into the truth, did not find an
answer to the questions under examination. That is why skepticism came
to be seen by dogmatic philosophers as a major challenge to their
philosophical project of finding the truth. Epistemologists and
metaphysicians alike set themselves the task of overcoming skepticism
in order to establish their own doctrines. Thus, one constantly finds
dogmatic philosophers trying to refute the skeptic. One criterion to
accept a philosophical proposal is to determine to what extent it
overcomes the skeptical challenge.

In ancient times, skepticism had two main different forms: Pyrrhonism
and Academic skepticism. Rediscovered in the Renaissance, skepticism
became one of the pillars of modern philosophy, not only after modern
skeptics, such as Michel de Montaigne, Pierre Bayle and David Hume,
gave new impulse to it, but also because of the many answers to it
developed by philosophers such as Francis Bacon, René
Descartes, George Berkeley and Immanuel Kant. In the analytic
tradition, from G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell onwards, skepticism
is a central topic of concern. This surprisingly long history shows
not only how deep is the skeptical challenge, but also how fascinating
the skeptical stance turns out to be.

Similarly to philosophers in many other parts of the world, Latin
American philosophers have faced skeptical challenges and have devoted
close attention to skepticism. They adopt, by and large, the same
understanding of skepticism, share the same historical tradition, from
Pyrrho to contemporary analytic philosophy, that philosophers
elsewhere have engaged with, and carry out the same kind of research
as scholars all over the world do. What is specific about Latin
American scholars on skepticism is the fact that they are, in general,
more sympathetic toward skepticism than philosophers elsewhere tend to
be. Consequently, one finds not only studies on the history of
skepticism and philosophical criticisms, but also developments of new
forms of skepticism, which are worth considering with some care.

Law and Language,0.4321843385696411,0.8179800510406494,"

The use of language is crucial to any legal system, not only in the
same way that it is crucial to politics in general, but also in two
special respects. Lawmakers characteristically use language to make
law, and law must provide for the authoritative resolution of disputes
over the effects of that use of language. Political philosophers are
not generally preoccupied with questions in the philosophy of
language. But legal philosophers are political philosophers with a
specialization that gives language (and philosophy of language) a
special
 importance.[1]

Philosophy of law can gain from a good philosophical account of the
meaning and use of language, and from a good philosophical account of
the institutionalized resolution of disputes over language. Philosophy
of language can gain from studying the stress-testing of language in
legal regulation and dispute resolution. And philosophers of language
can gain from the reminder that their task is not only to account for
what people share in virtue of the mastery of a language; they also
need to account for the possibility of disagreements over the meaning
and use of language, and for the possibility that there might be good
reason for resolving those disagreements in one way rather than
another.

In addition to their interest in the use of language in law,
philosophers of law have developed a second, interrelated interest in
using insights from the philosophy of language to address problems of
the nature of law. This article outlines some problems in each of
these two areas, after a brief historical note on the linguistic
preoccupations of legal philosophers.

The Limits of Law,0.4916463196277618,0.6990495324134827,"


It is clear that law has limits.  It has practical or
‘means-end’ limits; what lawmakers try to do may misfire
in many ways.  More interestingly, though, does law have
principled limits? The best known positive answer to this
question is that given by John Stuart Mill.  Mill's ‘harm
principle’ is examined in this entry, together with the more
recent defences of the principle by Joel Feinberg and Joseph Raz.
Other influential proposals for principled limits to the law are also
examined: for example, the suggestion that law must eschew certain
kinds of otherwise valid moral reasons and that the law must be in
some sense neutral.  Finding principled limits to the law, it will be
suggested, is an elusive task.

Natural Law Theories,0.43770113587379456,0.8078206181526184,"


This entry considers natural law theories only as theories of
law. That is not to say that legal theory can be adequately identified
and pursued independently of moral and political theory. Nor is it to
deny that there are worthwhile natural law theories much more
concerned with foundational issues in ethics and political theory than
with law or legal theory. A sample of such wider and more foundational
theories is the entry 
  Aquinas' moral, political, and legal philosophy.
In the present entry, “natural law theory”
is to be taken as shorthand for natural law theories just insofar as
they bear on law and are theories of or about it. This focus has the
important incidental effect that many historically important
differences between natural law theorists can be omitted, differences
which pertain more to the foundations of normativity than to the
nature and functions (or “the concept”) of positive
law.


Legal theorists who present or understand their theories as
“positivist”, or as instances of “legal
positivism”, take their theories to be opposed to, or at least
clearly distinct from, natural law theory. Natural law theorists, on
the other hand, did not conceive their theories in opposition to, or
even as distinct from, legal positivism (contra Soper 1992 at
2395). The term “positive law” was put into wide
philosophical circulation first by Aquinas, and natural law theories
of his kind share, or at least make no effort to deny, many or virtually
all “positivist” theses—except of course the bare
thesis that natural law theories are mistaken. Natural law theory
accepts that law can be considered and spoken of both as a
sheer social fact of power and practice, and as a set of
reasons for action that can be and often are sound as reasons and
therefore normative for reasonable people addressed by them. This dual
character of positive law is presupposed by the well-known slogan
“Unjust laws are not laws.” Properly understood, that
slogan indicates why—unless based upon some skeptical denial
that there are any sound reasons for action (a denial which can be set
aside because defending it is self-refuting)—positivist
opposition to natural law theories is pointless, that is redundant:
what positivists characteristically see as realities to be affirmed
are already affirmed by natural law theory, and what they
characteristically see as illusions to be dispelled are no part of
natural law theory. But because legal theories conceived of by their
authors as positivist are, by and large, dominant in the milieux of
those likely to be reading this entry, it seems appropriate to refer
to those theories along the way, in the hope of overcoming
misunderstandings that (while stimulating certain clarifications and
improvements of natural law theorizing) have generated some needless
debate.


The point made in the preceding paragraph is made in another way by
Orrego (Orrego 2007). When the accounts of adjudication and
judicial reasoning proposed by contemporary mainstream legal theories
are added to those theories' accounts of (the concept of) law, it
becomes clear that, at the level of propositions (as distinct from
names, words and formulations), those theories share (though not
always without self-contradiction) the principal theses about law
which are proposed by classic natural law theorists such as Aquinas:
(i) that law establishes reasons for action, (ii) that its rules can
and presumptively (defeasibly) do create moral obligations that did
not as such exist prior to the positing of the rules, (iii) that that
kind of legal-moral obligation is defeated by a posited rule's serious
immorality (injustice), and (iv) that judicial and other
paradigmatically legal deliberation, reasoning and judgment includes,
concurrently, both natural (moral) law and (purely) positive
law. Orrego's point seems to be confirmed by, e.g., the adjacent entry
on Legal Positivism (Green 2003).  Contemporary
“positivist” theories are, it seems, natural law theories,
distinguished from the main body of natural law theory (a) by their
denial that the theory of law (as distinct from the theory or
theories of adjudication, judicial duty, citizens' allegiance, etc.)
necessarily or most appropriately tackles the related matters just
listed, and accordingly (b) by the incompleteness of their theories of
law, that is, the absence from them (and usually, though not always,
from their accounts of those related matters) of systematic critical
attention to the foundations of the moral and other normative claims
that they make or presuppose.


In short: a natural law theory of (the nature of) law seeks both to
give an account of the facticity of law and to answer questions that
remain central to understanding law. As listed by Green 2003 (having
observed that “No legal philosopher can be only a legal
positivist”), these further questions (which “legal positivism
does not aspire to answer”) are: What kinds of things could
possibly count as merits of law? What role should law play in
adjudication?  What claim has law on our obedience?  What laws should
we have?  And should we have law at all?  All these questions, though
organized and articulated a little differently, are under
consideration in the present entry.

The Rule of Law,0.43421924114227295,0.7906917333602905,"

The phrase “the Rule of Law” has to be distinguished from
the phrase “a rule of law”. The latter phrase is used to
designate some particular legal rule like the rule against
perpetuities or the rule that says we have to file our taxes by a certain date. Those are
rules of law, but the Rule of Law is one of the ideals of our
political morality and it refers to the ascendancy of law as such and
of the institutions of the legal system in a system of governance.


The Rule of Law comprises a number of principles of a formal and
procedural character, addressing the way in which a community is
governed. The formal principles concern the generality, clarity,
publicity, stability, and prospectivity of the norms that govern a
society. The procedural principles concern the processes by which
these norms are administered, and the institutions—like courts
and an independent judiciary that their administration requires. On
some accounts, the Rule of Law also comprises certain substantive
ideals like a presumption of liberty and respect for private property
rights. But these are much more controversial (see
 section 1
 below). And indeed as we shall see there is a great deal of
controversy about what the Rule of Law requires.

Laws of Nature,0.8378671407699585,0.5327596664428711,"

Science includes many principles at least once thought to be laws of
nature: Newton’s law of gravitation, his three laws of motion,
the ideal gas laws, Mendel’s laws, the laws of supply and
demand, and so on. Other regularities important to science were not
thought to have this status. These include regularities that, unlike
laws, were (or still are) thought by scientists to stand in need of
explanation. These include the regularity of the ocean tides, the
perihelion of Mercury’s orbit, the photoelectric effect, that
the universe is expanding, and so on. Scientists also use laws but not
other regularities to sort out what is possible: It is based on their
consistency with Einstein’s laws of gravity that cosmologists
recognize the possibility that our universe is closed and the
possibility that it is open (Maudlin 2007, 7–8). In statistical
mechanics, the laws of an underlying physical theory are used to
determine the dynamically possible trajectories through the state
space of the system (Roberts 2008, 12–16). 

Philosophers of science and metaphysicians address various issues
about laws, but the basic question is: What is it to be a
law? Two influential answers are David Lewis’s systems approach
(1973, 1983, 1986, 1994) and David Armstrong’s universals
approach (1978, 1983, 1991, 1993). Other treatments include
antirealist views (van Fraassen 1989, Giere 1999, Ward 2002, Mumford
2004) and antireductionist views (Carroll 1994 and 2008, Lange 2000
and 2009, Maudlin 2007). Besides the basic question, the recent
literature has also focused on (i) whether laws supervene on matters
of fact, (ii) the role laws play in the problem of induction, (iii)
whether laws involve metaphysical necessity, and (iv) the role of laws
in physics and how that contrasts with the role of laws in the special
sciences.

Perceptual Learning,0.748582124710083,0.3812939524650574,"

“Perceptual Learning” refers, roughly, to long-lasting
changes in perception that result from practice or experience (see
E.J. Gibson 1963). William James, for instance, writes about how a
person can become able to differentiate by taste between the upper and
lower half of a bottle for a particular kind of wine (1890: 509).
Assuming that the change in the person’s perception lasts, is
genuinely perceptual (rather than, say, a learned inference), and is
based on prior experience, James’ case is a case of perceptual
learning.

This entry has three parts. The first part lays out the definition of
perceptual learning as long-term changes in perception that result
from practice or experience, and then distinguishes perceptual
learning from several contrast classes. The second part specifies
different varieties of perceptual learning. The third part details
cases of perceptual learning in the philosophical literature and says
why they are philosophically significant.

Formal Learning Theory,0.8567374944686891,0.515772819519043,"

Formal learning theory is the mathematical embodiment of a normative
epistemology. It deals with the question of how an agent should use
observations about her environment to arrive at correct and
informative conclusions. Philosophers such as Putnam, Glymour and
Kelly have developed learning theory as a normative framework for
scientific reasoning and inductive inference. 

Terminology. Cognitive science and related fields typically
use the term “learning” for the process of gaining
information through observation— hence the name “learning
theory”. To most cognitive scientists, the term “learning
theory” suggests the empirical study of human and animal
learning stemming from the behaviourist paradigm in psychology. The
epithet “formal” distinguishes the subject of this entry
from behaviourist learning theory. Philosophical terms for
learning-theoretic epistemology include “logical
reliability” (Kelly [1996], Glymour [1991]) and
“means-ends epistemology” (Schulte [1999]).

Because many developments in, and applications of, formal learning
theory come from computer science, the term “computational
learning theory” is also common. Many results on learning theory
in computer science are concerned with Valiant’s and Vapnik’s notion
of learning generalizations that are probably approximately correct
(PAC learning) (Valiant [1984]). This notion of empirical success was
introduced to philosophers by Gilbert Harmann in his Nicode lectures,
and elaborated in a subsequent book [2007]. Valiant himself provides
an accessible account of PAC learning and its relationship to the
problem of induction in a recent book (Valiant [2013, Ch. 5]). The
present article describes a nonstatistical tradition of learning
theory stemming from the seminal work of Hilary Putnam [1963] and Mark
E. Gold [1967]. 

Philosophical characteristics. In contrast to other
philosophical approaches to inductive inference, learning theory does
not aim to describe a universal inductive method or explicate general
axioms of inductive rationality. Rather, learning theory pursues a
context-dependent means-ends analysis: For a given empirical problem
and a set of cognitive goals, what is the best method for achieving
the goals? Most of learning theory examines  which investigative
strategies reliably and efficiently lead to correct beliefs about the
world. 

Article Overview. Compared to traditional philosphical
discussions of inductive inference, learning theory provides a
radically new way of thinking about induction and scientific method.
The main aim of this article is explain the main concepts of the
theory through examples. Running examples are repeated throughout the
entry; at the same time, the sections are meant to be as independent
of each other as possible. We use the examples to illustrate some
theorems of philosophical interest, and to highlight the key
philosophical ideas and insights behind learning theory. 

Readers interested in the mathematical substance of learning theory
will find some references in the
 Bibliography,
 and a summary of the basic definitions in the
 Supplementary Document.
 A text by Jain et al. collects many of the main definitions and
theorems [1999]. New results appear in proceedings of annual
conferences, such as the Conferences on Learning Theory (COLT) and
Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT). The philosophical issues and
motivation pertaining to learning-theoretic epistemology are discussed
extensively in the works of philosophers such as Putnam, Glymour and
Kelly (Putnam [1963], Glymour [1991], Glymour and Kelly [1992], Kelly
[1996]).

Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples,0.6617302894592285,0.12225212901830672,"
Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples (c. 1450–1536) taught
philosophy at the University of Paris from around 1490 to 1508, and
then applied his erudition and textual scholarship to biblical studies
and religious reform. Lefèvre traveled to Italy in 1491, 1500,
and 1507. There he sought out Ermolao Barbaro, Giovanni Pico della
Mirandola, Marsilio Ficino, Angelo Poliziano, and other famous
humanists. He became famous for the many introductions to,
commentaries on, and editions of philosophical works which he
published in Paris.  These repackaged the full range of philosophical
studies, from his early interests in mathematics and natural magic, to
the entire curriculum of university logic, natural philosophy, moral
philosophy, and metaphysics.
Early modern scholars, from Francesco Patrizi da Cherso in the
sixteenth century to Johann Jacob Brucker in the eighteenth, hailed
Lefèvre as a leading humanist, particularly praising his
replacement of scholastic questions with humanist eloquence. Modern
scholars have taken a more nuanced view, studying Lefèvre's
historical context: he pursued a humanist project from within
the university. Even after he retired from teaching philosophy, his
versions of Aristotle were published in new editions, sometimes with
new commentaries, for several decades—for historians of
Renaissance philosophy, they mark the northward, university-based
movement of a humanist approach to Aristotle which earlier scholars
such as Leonardo Bruni and Ermolao Barbaro had pioneered in Italy. The
university environment gave Lefèvre's vision of philosophical
reform a broad scope, extending even to mathematical works of the
quadrivium. He also contributed to Renaissance philosophy beyond the
university with important editions of the corpus attributed to Hermes
Trismegistus, various Church Fathers, the Catalan mystic Ramon Lull,
and the opera omnia of Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa.
Lefèvre's wide-ranging publications and their philosophical
import require more scholarly analysis than they have yet
received. Since, however, his primary contribution to the history of
philosophy was pedagogical and entailed reformulating older works to
serve new audiences, the following survey focuses more on the broader
outlines of his project than on his specific philosophical
doctrines.

The Economic Analysis of Law,0.4417067170143128,0.8021059632301331,"

Economic analysis of law applies the tools of microeconomic theory to
the analysis of legal rules and institutions. Ronald Coase [1960] and
Guido Calabresi [1961] are generally identified as the seminal
articles but Commons [1924] and Hale [1952] among others had brought
economic thinking to the study of law in the 1910s and 1920s.

Richard Posner [1973] brought economic analysis of law to the
attention of the general legal academy; by the late 1970s, his work
had provoked a vigorous controversy. This controversy was both general
and doctrinally specific. Posner had claimed generally that the common
law was and ought to be efficient. This latter claim provoked a broad
controversy about the evaluation of legal rules generally.

More specifically, controversy recurred each time economic analysts of
law addressed another doctrinal area. More often than not, the
introduction of economic analysis into the study of a doctrine
transformed that area of scholarship. For a time, economic analysis
dominated the study of private law in the United States; arguably it
still dominates, though a healthy resurgence of moral accounts of
these areas has recently emerged to challenge economic analysis of
private law.

Many practitioners and critics alike believe that economic analysis of
law offers a comprehensive theory of law. As traditionally understood,
a comprehensive theory of law has several components. First, a
comprehensive theory of law begins with a characterization of the
nature of law. This component distinguishes law both from other
normative systems such as morality, religion, and social conventions
such as etiquette but also from coercion and politics.

The second part of a comprehensive theory of law characterizes the
grounds of law. Dworkin framed the grounds of law as the truth
conditions for a proposition of law. From this perspective, much of
the debate over the concept of law concerns the role that morality
plays in these truth conditions. As discussed in section 3 below, the
first and second parts of a comprehensive theory of law have often
been conflated in the debate over the concept of law.

The third part of a a comprehensive theory of law identifies the
nature of the reasons for action that law provides. Often, this aspect
of a theory of law is subsumed under the second part that identifies
the grounds of law. For purposes of an exposition of the economic
theory of law, however, it is useful to distinguish these two
questions.

The fourth part of a comprehensive theory of law identifies the value
of legality. The fifth and final part of a comprehensive theory of law
articulates a normative theory of adjudication, a theory of how judges
ought to decide cases.

Framed this way, it is not clear that economic analysis of law does
provide a comprehensive theory of law. The questions posed above have
rarely been addressed clearly and explicitly by economic analysts of
law. The early debates conflated theories of adjudication with the
value of legality; subsequent debates have largely concerned theories
of private law rather than of law generally. This essay thus offers
both an interpretation of the approach to these five questions
implicit in the practice of economic analysis of law and a
recharacterization of economic analysis of law generally. 

Economic analysis of law is not a single, unitary practice but a set
of projects that share a methodological approach. The typical economic
analysis of law does not set its task within the framework of a
general legal theory. Rather, it addresses a specific question about
the causes or consequences or social value of a specific legal rule or
set of legal rules. Phrased differently, the typical economic analysis
of law investigates a specific legal rule or institution rather than
make general claims about the nature of law. 

Nonetheless, economic analysis of law, or at least strands of it,
implicitly offer distinctive, often radical, answers to the questions
addressed by legal theory. Moreover, some strands suggest a radically
different perspective on law and legal theory. The next section sets
out the complex set of claims that emerge from the mass of economic
analyses of law and identifies three projects that organize much of
the work in the field. Subsequent sections ask what perspective on law
these claims and projects implicitly or explicitly provide.

Legal Positivism,0.4422219097614288,0.8123295903205872,"


Legal positivism is the thesis that the existence and content of law
depends on social facts and not on its merits. The English jurist John
Austin (1790-1859) formulated it thus: “The existence of law is
one thing; its merit and demerit another. Whether it be or be not is
one enquiry; whether it be or be not conformable to an assumed
standard, is a different enquiry.” (1832, p. 157) The positivist
thesis does not say that law's merits are unintelligible, unimportant,
or peripheral to the philosophy of law. It says that they do not
determine whether laws or legal systems exist. Whether a
society has a legal system depends on the presence of certain
structures of governance, not on the extent to which it satisfies
ideals of justice, democracy, or the rule of law. What laws are in
force in that system depends on what social standards its officials
recognize as authoritative; for example, legislative enactments,
judicial decisions, or social customs. The fact that a policy would be
just, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient reason for
thinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it is unjust,
unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason for
doubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has been
posited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.); as we might say
in a more modern idiom, positivism is the view that law is a social
construction. Austin thought the thesis “simple and
glaring.” While it is probably the dominant view among
analytically inclined philosophers of law, it is also the subject of
competing interpretations together with persistent criticisms and
misunderstandings.

The question of whether, and how, legal punishment can be justified
has long been a central concern of legal, moral, and political philosophy:
what could justify a state in using the apparatus of the law to
inflict intentionally burdensome treatment on its citizens? Radically
different answers to this question are offered by consequentialist and
by retributivist theorists — and by those who seek to
incorporate consequentialist and retributivist considerations in
‘mixed’ theories of punishment. Meanwhile, abolitionist
theorists argue that we should aim to replace legal punishment rather
than to justify it. Among the significant developments in recent work
on punishment theory are the characterisation of punishment as a
communicative enterprise, greater recognition that punishment’s
justification depends on the justification of the criminal law more
generally, and growing interest in the normative challenges raised by
punishment in the international context.

Interpretation and Coherence in Legal Reasoning,0.4363064169883728,0.8245068192481995,"


The subject of legal reasoning appears to occupy the more practical end
of the spectrum of jurisprudential theorising. Surely if anything
matters in our attempts to understand law, it matters how judges do
and/or should decide cases, and that we have an account which
adequately explains and can perhaps be used to guide or justify their activities.
The recent history of legal philosophy abounds with many and various
attempts to address these issues and others which have been viewed as
falling within the ambit of legal reasoning. Is legal reasoning an
activity which is exclusive to the adjudicative institutions of legal
systems or is any reasoning about the law to be regarded as legal
reasoning, no matter where or by whom it is undertaken? Does legal
reasoning take on a special character when it is undertaken in courts
and by judges? Are there special methods or modes of reasoning which
are unique to or at least distinctive of the law, or is legal reasoning
just like reasoning in any other sphere of human activity, distinctive
only in the subject matter to which it is applied? This last question
is particularly relevant to present concerns, as it is one task of this
entry to discuss various views concerning whether and to what extent
interpretation and coherence have a special role to play in legal
reasoning, because of the nature of law itself. 


After a brief clarificatory consideration of the ambit of the term,
‘legal reasoning’, the entry deals first with
interpretation and then with coherence, and discusses various views
concerning these concepts and their relevance for law. Throughout, the
discussion focuses upon the role which interpretation and coherence
play within legal reasoning, and the reasons why these concepts are
regarded by some as being distinctive of reasoning about the law.

Precedent and Analogy in Legal Reasoning,0.4335167706012726,0.8359869718551636,"


Arguments from precedent and analogy are two central forms of
reasoning found in many legal systems, especially ‘Common
Law’ systems such as those in England and the United
States. Precedent involves an earlier decision being followed in a
later case because both cases are the same. Analogy involves an
earlier decision being followed in a later case because the later case
is similar to the earlier one. The main philosophical problems raised
by precedent and analogy are these: (1) when are two cases the
‘same’ for the purposes of precedent? (2) when are two
cases ‘similar’ for the purposes of analogy? and (3) in
both situations, why should the decision in the earlier case affect
the decision in the later case?


The study of precedent and analogy is of interest for a number of
reasons:

some theorists claim that precedent involves a form of reasoning
different to reasoning using rules;
although arguments from precedent are extremely common in many
institutional and quasi-institutional settings, not merely the law,
there is no consensus on the rational basis for their force, nor indeed
on whether such arguments have any rational force;
some theorists argue that the use of analogies in law is not a
form of ‘reasoning’ at all; and finally,
even if there is an intelligible form of analogical reasoning, it
is unclear why the similarity between two situations provides a reason
for treating them both in the same manner.



The law presents a useful context for considering these issues
because its use of precedent and analogy is well articulated and
explicit. This entry is organised into the following
sections:

Legal Rights,0.442566990852356,0.7431626915931702,"


Legal rights are, clearly, rights which exist under the rules of legal
systems or by virtue of decisions of suitably authoritative bodies
within them. They raise a number of different philosophical issues.
(1) Whether legal rights are conceptually related to other types of
rights, principally moral rights; (2) What the analysis of the concept
of a legal right is; (3) What kinds of entities can be legal
right-holders; (4) Whether there any kinds of rights which are
exclusive to, or at least have much greater importance in, legal
systems, as opposed to morality; (5) What rights legal systems ought
to create or recognise. Issue (5) is primarily one of moral and
political philosophy, and is not different in general principle from
the issue of what duties, permissions, powers, etc, legal systems
ought to create or recognise. It will not, therefore, be addressed
here.


A preliminary point should be mentioned. Do all legal systems have a
concept of rights? Their use is pervasive in modern legal systems. We
talk of legislatures having the legal right to pass laws, of judges to
decide cases, of private individuals to make wills and contracts; as
well as of constitutions providing legal rights to the citizens against
fellow citizens and against the state itself. Yet it has been suggested
that even some sophisticated earlier systems, such as Roman law, had no
terminology which clearly separated rights from duties (see
Maine (1861), 269–70 ). The question is primarily one for
legal historians and will not be pursued here, but it may be remarked
that it may still be legitimate when describing those systems to talk
of rights in the modern sense, since Roman law, for example, clearly
achieved many of the same results as contemporary systems. Presumably,
it did so by deploying some of the more basic concepts into which
rights can, arguably, be analysed.

Political Legitimacy,0.4185763895511627,0.7156152725219727,"

Political legitimacy is a virtue of political institutions and of the
decisions—about laws, policies, and candidates for political
office—made within them. This entry will survey the main answers
that have been given to the following questions. First, how should
legitimacy be defined? Is it primarily a descriptive or a normative
concept? If legitimacy is understood normatively, what does it entail?
Some associate legitimacy with the justification of coercive power and
with the creation of political authority. Others associate it with the
justification, or at least the sanctioning, of existing political
authority. Authority stands for a right to rule—a right to issue
commands and, possibly, to enforce these commands using coercive
power. An additional question is whether legitimate political
authority is understood to entail political obligations or not. Most
people probably think it does. But some think that the moral
obligation to obey political authority can be separated from an
account of legitimate authority, or at least that such obligations
arise only if further conditions hold.

Next there are questions about the requirements of legitimacy. When
are political institutions and the decisions made within them
appropriately called legitimate? Some have argued that this question
has to be answered primarily on the basis of procedural features that
shape these institutions and underlie the decisions made. Others argue
that legitimacy depends—exclusively or at least in part—on
the substantive values that are realized. A related question is: does
political legitimacy demand democracy or not? This question is
intensely debated both in the national and the global context. Insofar
as democracy is seen as necessary for political legitimacy, when are
democratic decisions legitimate? Can that question be answered with
reference to procedural features only, or does democratic legitimacy
depend both on procedural values and on the quality of the decisions
made? Finally, there is the question which political institutions are
subject to the legitimacy requirement. Historically, legitimacy was
associated with the state and institutions and decisions within the
state. The contemporary literature tends to judge this as too narrow,
however. This raises the question how the concept of legitimacy may
apply—beyond the nation state and decisions made within
it—to the international and global context.

Antoine Le Grand,0.6567331552505493,0.3327776789665222,"


Antoine Le Grand (1629–1699) was a philosopher and catholic theologian
who played an important role in propagating the Cartesian philosophy in
England during the latter half of the seventeenth century. He was born
in Douai, (at the time under rule by the Spanish Hapsburgs), and early
in life was associated with an English community of Franciscans who had
a college there. Le Grand became a Franciscan Recollect friar prior to
leaving for England as a missionary in 1656. In England, he taught
philosophy and theology, advocating Catholicism and eventually
Cartesianism, the latter being as unpopular as the former was perilous.
It is not clear how Le Grand came to Cartesianism, but the first
evidence of his adoption of the new philosophy was in his
Institutio Philosophiae, published in London in 1672. His
early works show affinities to the philosophies of Seneca and
Epicurus.  He is noted for his polemical exchanges with Samuel Parker
and John Sergeant, and for having given Descartes’s work a
Scholastic form to further its acceptance in the schools.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz,0.6357026100158691,0.3828108310699463,"


Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) was one of the great
thinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and is known as
the last “universal genius”. He made deep and important
contributions to the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, logic,
philosophy of religion, as well as mathematics, physics, geology,
jurisprudence, and history. Even the eighteenth-century French atheist
and materialist Denis Diderot, whose views were very often at odds
with those of Leibniz, could not help being awed by his achievement,
writing in his entry on Leibniz in the Encyclopedia,
“Perhaps never has a man read as much, studied as much,
meditated more, and written more than Leibniz… What he has
composed on the world, God, nature, and the soul is of the most
sublime eloquence. If his ideas had been expressed with the flair of
Plato, the philosopher of Leipzig would cede nothing to the
philosopher of Athens.” (Oeuvres complètes,
vol. 7, p. 709) Indeed, Diderot was almost moved to despair in this
piece: “When one compares the talents one has with those of a
Leibniz, one is tempted to throw away one's books and go die quietly
in the dark of some forgotten corner.” (Oeuvres
complètes, vol. 7, p. 678) More than a century later,
Gottlob Frege, who fortunately did not cast his books away in despair,
expressed similar admiration, declaring that “in his writings,
Leibniz threw out such a profusion of seeds of ideas that in this
respect he is virtually in a class of his own.” (“Boole's
logical Calculus and the Concept-script” in
Posthumous Writings, p. 9) The aim of this entry is primarily
to introduce Leibniz's life and summarize and explicate his views
in the realms of metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophical theology.

Leibniz's Ethics,0.6242779493331909,0.3939963281154633,"

Although Leibniz never wrote a systematic ethical treatise, in his
view theology is a type of jurisprudence, a science of law (NE, p.
526). And Leibniz contributed a systematic work to the field of
theology, namely, the Theodicy (1710), the only large-scale
philosophical work that he published during his lifetime. Given that
Leibniz the natural theologian and metaphysician is, at the same time,
a moral philosopher, ethics has a central place in his philosophical
system. No divisions exist among the nominally different fields. Thus
the view that he never wrote a systematic ethical treatise is not true
without qualification. Moreover, the fact that he views theology as a
science of law provides some insight into the character of his ethics.
He offers a natural law theory, and, like other such theories, its
basic structure consists of a theory of the good and a theory of law.
Compliance with the principles spelled out in the latter is necessary
and sufficient to achieve the good. Since, according to Leibniz, God
is the measure of the good, the primary directive of his ethics is
that one ought to imitate divinity as far as possible.

Leibniz's Exoteric Philosophy,0.6397839784622192,0.3867104947566986,"


It is no secret that G. W. Leibniz is a difficult philosopher to
study. One central reason for this is that the content of his
philosophy is extremely challenging. It involves a range of
subtle distinctions and paradoxical theses, such as the denial of
causal interaction between substances and the thesis that each
substance expresses every other substance in the universe. Just
as significant, however, is the fact that his philosophical corpus is
immense, comprising a bewildering array of letters, notes, essays, and
larger manuscripts. These writings span a period of over fifty
years. Only a small number of his essays and one philosophical
book, the Essais de
théodicée, were published during his lifetime. 
None of his published or unpublished works is considered a magnum
opus on the order of Spinoza's Ethics or
Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. The complexity of
Leibniz's literary remains forces scholars of his thought to
engage difficult questions: how much continuity is there between
Leibniz's treatments of particular topics at different times in
his career? On what issues does he attain considered views? 
Should certain texts be privileged over others in attempting to discern
Leibniz's views? Is Leibniz a deeply systematic philosopher
who addresses a wide range of problems from the perspective of a
unified theory, or does he apply his penetrating mind to a series of
philosophical problems with little concern for the systematic coherence
of his results?


One clue for approaching the labyrinth of Leibniz's texts is a
distinction that he draws between esoteric
(acroamaticus/acroamatique) and exoteric
(exotericus/exoterique) presentations of his philosophy. 
Roughly speaking an esoteric presentation is one that is fully rigorous
while an exoteric or “popular” presentation is less
rigorous but easier to understand, which is more appropriate for a
general audience. Leibniz distinguishes between these two modes
of presentation early in his career and explicitly classifies many of
his (later) published works such as the Essais de
théodicée as exoteric. This distinction is
clearly relevant to the questions raised in the previous
paragraph. If it is possible to distinguish between esoteric and
exoteric texts, then the most precise statements of Leibniz's
considered views are likely to be found in the esoteric texts. 
Similarly, if Leibniz's treatments of an issue in different works
seem to be in tension with one another, one potential explanation of
the discrepancy is that one treatment is esoteric and the other is
exoteric. 


In order to plausibly use Leibniz's distinction between the
esoteric and the exoteric as an interpretive tool one must have a more
detailed account of how he understands the distinction. This
itself is not an easy matter, however, as Leibniz's remarks on
the distinction also require interpretation. One challenge for
understanding his views on this issue is that some of his most explicit
remarks on it are written quite early in his career. Although it
is clear that he does not abandon the distinction later in his career
one should not uncritically assume that his views on the distinction do
not change over time. A second challenge is that Leibniz
typically does not identify his exoteric texts as exoteric within those
texts. For example, if you were to focus exclusively on what
Leibniz writes in the Système nouveau de la nature et de la
communication des substances, aussi bien que de l'union
qu'il y a entre l'âme et le corps (New
system of the nature and communication of substances, and of the union
of the soul and body)—the first public presentation of his
philosophy—you would have no idea that it is a popular
presentation of is views. It is only in letters to certain of his
correspondents that Leibniz identifies this text as exoteric. And
when he does identify a text as exoteric he often provides few details
about exactly what this is supposed to involve. A third challenge
for understanding Leibniz's views is that he does not use the
terms “esoteric” and “exoteric”
univocally. Sometimes these words are used to distinguish
different kinds of content that a philosophy might have; other times
they signify different modes of presenting one's
philosophy. It will be crucial to disambiguate these terms as we
proceed.


The notion of an exoteric Leibnizian philosophy is often associated
with Bertrand Russell's influential interpretation of
Leibniz. Russell infamously claimed that the difference between
Leibniz's public and private writings is so significant that they
effectively comprise two distinct philosophies: a theologically
imbued fantasy designed to please royalty, and his true philosophy,
derived from austere logical principles, that he revealed to a select
few of his correspondents (Russell 1945). In recent decades
Russell's view has been rejected; nearly everyone agrees that
there is more continuity between Leibniz's public and private
works than Russell was willing to admit (see Curley 1982 for a critique
of Russell's view). And as we will see, the distinction
between the esoteric and the exoteric does not involve a simple
classification of his works depending on whether or not they were
published. In order to attain a more accurate understanding of
Leibniz's distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric we
must turn to his views on the ideal form that metaphysics should
take.

Leibniz's Influence on 19th Century Logic,0.635547935962677,0.3945677876472473,"


It is an important question in the historiography of modern logic
whether Leibniz's logical calculi influenced logic in its present
state or whether they were only ingenious anticipations. The most
significant of Leibniz's contributions to formal logic were
published in the early 20th century. Only then, Leibniz's logic
could be fully understood. Nevertheless, the essentials of his
philosophy of logic and some technical elaborations could be derived
from early editions of his writings published in the 18th and 19th
centuries.


The most important of these editions was Johann Eduard
Erdmann's collection of Leibniz's philosophical works
(1839/40) which led to a first wave of reception of Leibniz's
logic. This edition and Adolf Trendelenburg's discussion of
Leibniz's theory of signs on the basis of texts published in it
allowed a further reception of Leibnizian ideas among mathematical
logicians at the end of the 19th century.

Leibniz's Modal Metaphysics,0.6297792792320251,0.3813086748123169,"


In the main article on Leibniz, it was claimed that Leibniz's
philosophy can be seen as a reaction to the Cartesian theory of
corporeal substance and the necessitarianism of Spinoza and
Hobbes. This entry will address this second aspect of his
philosophy. In the course of his writings, Leibniz developed an
approach to questions of modality—necessity, possibility,
contingency—that not only served an important function within
his general metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophical theology but
also has continuing interest today. Indeed, it has been suggested that
20th-century developments in modal logic were either based
on Leibnizian insights or at least had a Leibnizian spirit.

Leibniz on Causation,0.6361257433891296,0.3717592656612396,"

Substances, according to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716),
always act; furthermore, since even finite, created substances are
naturally indestructible and thus immortal, substances continue to act
forever. To what or to whom do substances causally owe their action?
In Leibniz’s day, this question more or less becomes a question
about the causal role of God. Is God the only genuine causal agent in
nature? Or does God’s causal contribution, at least in the
ordinary development of nature, consist “merely” in the
creation and conservation of created substances? We will see that
Leibniz holds that both God and created substances are causally
responsible for changes in the states of substances. There is another
question particularly salient for the seventeenth century philosopher:
What kinds of causes are present in substantial activity? Just thirty
years after Leibniz’s death, David Hume stated that his own
definition of cause entails that “all causes are of the same
kind,” namely, efficient (i.e., productive) causes.
Leibniz’s theory of causation instead integrates efficient,
final, and even formal causes, as it tries to explain away real
causation among phenomenal things with the infamous pre-established
harmony.

Leibniz on the Problem of Evil,0.6295300126075745,0.3890558779239655,"


There is no question that the problem of evil vexed Leibniz as much as
any of the problems that he engaged in the course of his philosophical
career. This is manifest in the fact that the first and the last
book-length works that he authored, the
Philosopher's Confession (written at age 26 in 1672) and
the Theodicy (written in 1709, seven years before his death)
were both devoted to this problem, as well as in the fact that in the
intervening years Leibniz wrote numerous short pieces on related
issues––many of which may be found in Gr and will soon be
available in English translations currently being undertaken by
R. C. Sleigh, Jr.–– and one full-length work,
the Dissertation on Predestination and Grace (DPG), which was
only published in 2011.  The fact that the Theodicy was the
only book-length treatise that Leibniz published during his lifetime
provides further evidence of the significance that he attributed to
the topic. It is therefore appropriate that it has now become an
interpretive commonplace that Leibniz's concern with the problem of
evil was central to his overarching philosophical concerns throughout
his philosophical career.  [See Rutherford (1995) and Antognazza
(2009).]  Leibniz's approach to the problem of evil became known to
many readers through Voltaire's lampoon in Candide: the link
that Voltaire seems to forge between Leibniz and the extravagant
optimism of Dr. Pangloss continues––for better or
worse––to shape the popular understanding of Leibniz's
approach to the problem of evil.  In this entry we examine the two
main species of the problem of evil that Leibniz addresses. The first,
“the underachiever problem,” is raised by a critic who
would argue that the existence of evil in our world indicates that God
cannot be as knowledgeable, powerful, or good as traditional
monotheists have claimed. The second, “the holiness
problem,” is raised by the critic who would argue that God's
intimate causal entanglements with the world make God the cause of
evil. God is thereby implicated in evil to the detriment of his
holiness.

Leibniz's Philosophy of Mind,0.6365898847579956,0.3779810667037964,"


In a more popular view, Leibniz's place in the history of the
philosophy of mind is best secured by his pre-established harmony,
that is, roughly, by the thesis that there is no mind-body interaction
strictly speaking, but only a non-causal relationship of harmony,
parallelism, or correspondence between mind and body. Certainly, the
pre-established harmony is important for a proper understanding of
Leibniz's philosophy of mind, but there is much more to be considered
as well, and even in connection with the pre-established harmony, the
more popular view needs to be refined, particularly insofar as it
suggests that Leibniz accepts a roughly Cartesian, albeit
non-interactionist dualism, which he does not. In fact, Leibniz is
justly famous for his critiques, not only of materialism, but also of
such a dualism. (Whether Leibniz accepts, throughout his maturity, the
idealistic view that all substances are simple unextended substances
or monads is an important interpretive issue that has been discussed
widely in recent years. We shall not try to resolve the issue
here. (See Garber 2009 for comprehensive treatment.) In short, Leibniz
made important contributions to a number of classical topics of the
philosophy of mind, including materialism, dualism, idealism and
mind-body interaction.


But Leibniz has much to say about the philosophy of mind that goes
well beyond these traditionally important topics. Perhaps surprisingly,
his system sometimes contains ideas of relevance even to contemporary
discussions in the cognitive sciences. More generally, he discusses in
depth the nature of perception and thought (conscious and unconscious),
and of human motivation and striving (or, as he would say, appetition).
We will take up such topics in what follows.

controversial twentieth century Jewish thinkers and Israeli public
intellectuals. Once termed “the conscience of

by his childhood
contemporary from Riga, Sir Isaiah Berlin, Leibowitz's thought is
founded on a far-reaching theocentrism that allows him to combine a
commitment to Orthodox Jewish practice with a stripped-down definition
of Jewish faith that yields a radically naturalistic theology—if,
indeed, what is left can bear the burden of the term
“theology” at all. But the influence of this theocentric
commitment spreads far beyond the confines of his views on religious
faith. It is the ultimate source of his unyielding criticism of the
rabbinic establishment in Israel, and what—“in the face of so
much pressure to be sensible, to be realistic, not to let the side
down” as Berlin (1983, 18) put it—was seen at the time as a

 Stanisław Leśniewski (1886–1939) was one of the
principal founders and movers of the school of logic that flourished in
Warsaw between the two world wars. He was the originator of an
unorthodox system of the foundations of mathematics, based on three
formal systems: Protothetic, a logic of propositions and their
functions; Ontology: a logic of names, and functors of arbitrary order;
and Mereology, a general theory of part and whole. His concern for
utmost rigor in the formalization and execution of logic, coupled with
a nominalistic rejection of abstract entities, led to a precise but
highly unusual metalogic. His strictures on correctly
distinguishing use from mention of expressions, his canons of correct
definition, and his mereology, have all informed the logical
mainstream, but the majority of his logical views and innovations have
not been widely adopted. Despite this, his influence as a teacher and
as a motor for logical innovation are widely acknowledged. He remains

Levels of Organization in Biology,0.9401441812515259,0.5046060085296631,"

Levels of organization are structures in nature, usually defined by
part-whole relationships, with things at higher levels being composed
of things at the next lower level. Typical levels of organization that
one finds in the literature include the atomic, molecular, cellular,
tissue, organ, organismal, group, population, community, ecosystem,
landscape, and biosphere levels. References to levels of organization
and related hierarchical depictions of nature are prominent in the
life sciences and their philosophical study, and appear not only in
introductory textbooks and lectures, but also in cutting-edge research
articles and reviews. In philosophy, perennial debates such as
reduction, emergence, mechanistic explanation, interdisciplinary
relations, natural selection, and many other topics, also rely
substantially on the notion.

Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the notion, levels of organization
have received little explicit attention in biology or its philosophy.
Usually they appear in the background as an implicit conceptual
framework that is associated with vague intuitions. Attempts at
providing general and broadly applicable definitions of levels of
organization have not met wide acceptance. In recent years, several
authors have put forward localized and minimalistic accounts of
levels, and others have raised doubts about the usefulness of the
notion as a whole. 

There are many kinds of ‘levels’ that one may find in
philosophy, science, and everyday life—the term is notoriously
ambiguous. Besides levels of organization, there are levels of
abstraction, realization, being, analysis, processing, theory,
science, complexity, and many others. In this article, the focus will
be on levels of organization and debates associated with them, and
other kinds of levels will only be discussed when they are relevant to
this main topic.

Emmanuel Levinas,0.5283296108245851,0.5028393268585205,"


Levinas's philosophy has been called ethics. If ethics means
rationalist self-legislation and freedom (deontology), the calculation
of happiness (utilitarianism), or the cultivation of virtues (virtue
ethics), then Levinas's philosophy is not an ethics. Levinas claimed,
in 1961, that he was developing a “first philosophy.” This
first philosophy is neither traditional logic nor metaphysics,
 however.[1]
 It is an interpretive, phenomenological description of the rise and
repetition of the face-to-face encounter, or the intersubjective
relation at its precognitive core; viz., being called by another and
responding to that other. If precognitive experience, that is, human
sensibility, can be characterized conceptually, then it must be
described in what is most characteristic to it: a continuum of
sensibility and affectivity, in other words, sentience and emotion in
their
 interconnection.[2]


This entry will focus on Levinas's philosophy, rather
than his Talmudic lessons (see the bibliography) and his essays on
Judaism (notably, Difficult Freedom: Essays on
Judaism, 1963). Levinas's philosophical project can be
called constructivist. He proposes phenomenological description and a
hermeneutics of lived experience in the world. He lays bare levels of
experience described neither by Husserl nor by Heidegger. These layers
of experience concern the encounter with the world, with the human
other, and a reconstruction of a layered interiority characterized by
sensibility and affectivity.

philosophers of the last half of the 20th century.

David Lewis,0.8191015124320984,0.5505765676498413,"


David Lewis (1941–2001) was one of the most important philosophers of
the 20th Century. He made significant contributions to philosophy of 
language, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of science, decision 
theory, epistemology, meta-ethics and aesthetics. In most of these 
fields he is essential reading; in many of them he is among the most 
important figures of recent decades. And this list leaves out his two
most significant contributions.


In philosophy of mind, Lewis developed and defended at length a new 
version of materialism (see the entry on 
 physicalism).
 He started by showing how the motivations driving the identity theory
of mind and 
 functionalism
 could be reconciled in his theory of mind. He called this an 
identity theory, though his theory motivated the position now known as 
 analytic functionalism.
 And he developed detailed accounts of mental content (building on 
Davidson's 
 interpretationism)
 and phenomenal knowledge (building on Nemirow's 
 ability hypothesis)
 that are consistent with his materialism. The synthesis Lewis ended 
up with is one of the central positions in contemporary debates in 
philosophy of mind.


But his largest contributions were in metaphysics. One branch of his
metaphysics was his Hume-inspired reductionism about the
nomological. He developed a position he called “Humean
supervenience”, the theory that said that there was nothing to
reality except the spatio-temporal distribution of local natural
properties. And he did this by showing in detail how
 laws, chances,
 counterfactual dependence,
 causation,
 dispositions and colours could be located within this Humean mosaic.
The other branch of his metaphysics was his 
 modal realism.
 Lewis held that the best theory of modality posited concrete possible
worlds. A proposition is possible if and only if it is true at one of these 
worlds. Lewis defended this view in his most significant book, On
the Plurality of Worlds. Alongside this, Lewis developed a new 
account of how to think about modal properties of individuals, namely
 counterpart theory,

David Lewis's Metaphysics,0.8155497908592224,0.5492205023765564,"


David Lewis produced a body of philosophical writing that, in four
books and scores of articles, spanned every major philosophical area,
with perhaps the greatest concentration in metaphysics, philosophy of
language, philosophical logic, and philosophy of mind. Despite this
astonishing variety, a newcomer to Lewis's philosophy would be best
advised to begin with his metaphysics (especially: 1986a, 1986e,
1999). There are several reasons. First, the majority of Lewis's work
either concerns, or substantially overlaps, topics in
metaphysics. Second, the metaphysical positions Lewis stakes out are
strikingly original and powerfully argued. Third, there is a coherence
and systematicity to this work that makes it a particularly
appropriate object for study, in that one sees trademark Lewisian
philosophical maneuvers clearly on display. (Indeed, if one wished to
learn how to do philosophy in a Lewisian style, the most efficient way
to do so would be to study his work in metaphysics.) Finally, and
perhaps most interestingly, Lewis's metaphysics exerted a profound
regulating influence on the rest of his philosophy: if some otherwise
attractive position on some philosophical problem could not be made to
square with his overall metaphysical outlook, then it would have to be
abandoned.


I should forestall one possible misunderstanding. You might think
that, given what I've just said, the way Lewis would recommend
doing philosophy is as follows: First you figure out what your basic
metaphysical commitments should be; then you turn your attention to
various broad but non-foundational philosophical subject matters
(personal identity, mental content, the nature of knowledge, theory of
value, etc.), and work out the consequences in each of these arenas of
your fundamental metaphysical posits. Nothing could be further from
Lewis's preferred methodology. (Well, maybe relying on divine
revelation would be further….) What he in fact recommends is a
holistic approach: we start with the total body of claims we are
inclined to believe—whether on the basis of “common
sense” (an oft-invoked category, for Lewis) or of
science—and try our best to systematize it in accordance
with standards of theoretical goodness that are themselves endorsed by
common sense and/or science (and so are themselves, to some extent,
also up for grabs). A substantial portion of Lewis's overall body
of philosophical work can thus be seen as an extended—and
breathtakingly ambitious—attempt at achieving total
reflective equilibrium. Here is an especially succinct description
of this approach:

  One comes to philosophy already endowed with a stock of opinions. It
  is not the business of philosophy either to undermine or to justify
  these preexisting opinions, to any great extent, but only to try to
  discover ways of expanding them into an orderly system. (1973b, p.
  88) 

Still, while Lewis's method of philosophical inquiry is certainly not
“bottom-up”, in my opinion it is best to present
the results of that inquiry in a bottom-up fashion.  That is
what this essay, and ones to follow, will attempt to do. I will divide
the terrain into four parts: Lewis's fundamental ontology; his theory
of metaphysical modality; his “applied” metaphysics
(covering such topics as laws of nature, counterfactuals, causation,
identity through time, and the mind); and Lewisian methodology in
metaphysics. I'll explain these distinctions shortly, but be advised
that the present essay will almost exclusively address the first of
these four topics.  Other aspects of Lewis's thought are covered
in the general entry on 
 David Lewis.

Liar Paradox,0.8518520593643188,0.7509933114051819,"

The first sentence in this essay is a lie. There is something odd
about saying so, as has been known since ancient times. To see why,
remember that all lies are untrue. Is the first sentence true? If it
is, then it is a lie, and so it is not true. Conversely, suppose that
it is not true. We (viz., the authors) have said it, and normally
things are said with the intention of being believed. Saying something
that way when it is untrue is a lie. But then, given what the sentence
says, it is true after all!

That there is some sort of puzzle to be found with sentences like the
first one of this essay has been noted frequently throughout the
history of philosophy. It was discussed in classical times, notably by
the Megarians, but it was also mentioned by Aristotle and by Cicero.
As one of the insolubilia, it was the subject of extensive
investigation by medieval logicians such as Buridan. More recently,
work on this problem has been an integral part of the development of
modern mathematical logic, and it has become a subject of extensive
research in its own right. The paradox is sometimes called the
‘Epimenides paradox’ as the tradition attributes a
sentence like the first one in this essay to Epimenides of Crete, who
is reputed to have said that all Cretans are always liars. That some
Cretan has said so winds up in no less a source than New
 Testament![1]

Lying is a complicated matter, but what’s puzzling about
sentences like the first one of this essay isn’t essentially
tied to intentions, social norms, or anything like that. Rather, it
seems to have something to do with truth, or at least, some semantic
notion related to truth. The puzzle is usually named ‘the Liar
paradox’, though this really names a family of paradoxes that
are associated with our type of puzzling sentence. The family is aptly
named one of paradoxes, as they seem to lead to incoherent
conclusions, such as: “everything is true”. Indeed, the
Liar seems to allow us to reach such conclusions on the basis of
logic, plus some very obvious principles that have sometimes been
counted as principles of logic. Thus, we have the rather surprising
situation of something near or like logic alone leading us to
incoherence. This is perhaps the most virulent strain of paradox, and
dealing with it has been an important task in logic for about as long
as there has been logic.

In this essay, we will review the important members of the family of
Liar paradoxes, and some of the important ideas about how these
paradoxes might be resolved. The past few thousand years have yielded
a great number of proposals, and we will not be able to examine all of
them; instead, we will focus on a few that have, in recent
discussions, proved to be important.

Philosophy of Liberation,0.5947108268737793,0.5558404326438904,"
Philosophy of Liberation is the collective name for a philosophical
movement and method of doing philosophy that emerged at first in
Argentina during the late sixties, but that went on to spread
throughout Latin American during the early seventies. It is for this
reason that sometimes some critics and historiographers of the
philosophy of liberation make reference to a “strict” and
a “broad” conception of the philosophy of liberation, in
order to refer to the immediate context of its earliest articulations,
and to its later general dissemination and development. The philosophy
of liberation belongs to the “maturity” stage within the
“contemporary” period of Latin American philosophy, if we
use Jorge J.E. Gracia and Manuel Vargas’s periodization of Latin
American philosophy (Gracia and Vargas 2013). Without question,
however, the philosophy of liberation is the distinct manifestation of
Latin American philosophy that has received the most international
attention, and that has had the most influence both within Latin
America and the
 United States[1].
 While the philosophy of liberation is deeply rooted in the history
and debates of Latin American philosophy, to the extent that it may be
claimed that it is the most elaborate and substantive response to the
task articulating a distinct Latin American philosophy, it is
nonetheless also a chapter within the broader history of European
philosophy. Even as it defines itself as a critique of Eurocentrism
and the hegemony of European philosophy, it has evolved out of and
made use of its philosophical currents, movements, concepts and
debates. Some may be argue that the philosophy of liberation belongs
to phenomenology, hermeneutics, and Marxism, or more generally,
historical materialism. In fact, because many philosophers of
liberation came out of these different traditions, the philosophy of
liberation was and remains from the outset an internally heterogeneous
movement.
 The philosophy of liberation aims to think the distinct world
historical character of Latin America, using what are argued to be
autochthonous intellectual resources, from out of a situation of
economic, cultural, political dependency. It has a practical aim:
liberation. In very general terms, the philosophy of liberation
defines itself as a counter-philosophical discourse, whether it be as
a critique of colonialism, imperialism, globalization, racism, and
sexism, which is articulated from out of the experience of
exploitation, destitution, alienation and reification, in the name of
the projects of liberation, autonomy and authenticity. That is, the
philosophy of liberation has presented itself as an “epistemic
rupture” that aims to critique and challenge not only basic
assumptions and themes of Euro-American philosophy, but also to make
philosophy more responsible and responsible for the socio-political
situation in which it always finds itself. Thus, by
“counter-philosophical discourse”, philosophers of
liberation did not mean that it was
“anti-philosophical”. Instead, they meant to emphasize a
heightened degree of reflexiveness or self-awareness in their
theorizing. Positively, the philosophy of liberation affirms cultural
diversity, gender and racial equality, and political sovereignty. The
philosophy of liberation’s philosophical orbit is defined by the
axes of critique, commitment, engagement, and liberation. As a
critique of all forms of philosophical dependency and inauthenticity,
it is consciously and avowedly a metaphilosophy. The philosophy of
liberation is thus, among other things, a view about what counts as
philosophy and how it should be pursued.
 This article is divided into four main parts: history, background,
currents, and themes and debates.

Libertarianism,0.4586523473262787,0.7351367473602295,"

Libertarianism is a family of views in political philosophy.
Libertarians strongly value individual freedom and see this as
justifying strong protections for individual freedom. Thus,
libertarians insist that justice poses stringent limits to coercion.
While people can be justifiably forced to do certain things (most
obviously, to refrain from violating the rights of others) they cannot
be coerced to serve the overall good of society, or even their own
personal good. As a result, libertarians endorse strong rights to
individual liberty and private property; defend civil liberties like
equal rights for homosexuals; endorse drug decriminalization, open
borders, and oppose most military interventions.

Libertarian positions are most controversial in the realm of
distributive justice. In this context, libertarians typically endorse
something like a free-market economy: an economic order based on
private property and voluntary market relationships among agents.
Libertarians usually see the kind of large-scale, coercive wealth
redistribution in which contemporary welfare states engage as
involving unjustified coercion. The same is true of many forms of
economic regulation, including licensing laws. Just as people have
strong rights to individual freedom in their personal and social
affairs, libertarians argue, they also have strong rights to freedom
in their economic affairs. Thus, rights of freedom of contract and
exchange, freedom of occupation, and private property are taken very
seriously.

In these respects, libertarian theory is closely related to (indeed,
at times practically indistinguishable from) the classical liberal
tradition, as embodied by John Locke, David Hume, Adam Smith, and
Immanuel Kant. It affirms a strong distinction between the public and
the private spheres of life; insists on the status of individuals as
morally free and equal, something it interprets as implying a strong
requirement of individuals sovereignty; and believes that a respect
for this status requires treating people as right-holders, including
as holders of rights in property.

It is popular to label libertarianism as a “right-wing” doctrine.
But this is mistaken. For one, on social (rather than economic)
issues, libertarianism tends to be “left-wing”. And second, in
addition to the better-known version of libertarianism
(right-libertarianism) there is also a version known as
“left-libertarianism”. Both endorse similar rights over the person
but differ with respect to how much people can appropriate in terms of
unowned natural resources (land, air, water, minerals, etc.).
Right-libertarianism holds that typically such resources may be
appropriated, for example, by the first person who discovers them,
mixes her labor with them, or merely claims them, without the consent
of others, and with little or no payment to them. Left-libertarianism,
by contrast, holds that unappropriated natural resources belong to
everyone in some egalitarian manner. It can, for example, require
those who claim rights over natural resources to make a payment to
others for the value of those rights. This can provide the basis for a
kind of egalitarian redistribution.

Life,0.9549517035484314,0.5150167942047119,"


Life is often defined in basic biology textbooks in terms of a list of
distinctive properties that distinguish living systems from
non-living. Although there is some overlap, these lists are often
different, depending upon the interests of the authors. Each attempt
at a definition are inextricably linked to a theory from which it
derives its meaning (Benner 2010).  Some biologists and philosophers
even reject the whole idea of there being a need for a definition,
since life for them is an irreducible fact about the natural
world. Others see life simply as that which biologists study.  There
have been three main philosophical approaches to the problem of
defining life that remain relevant today: Aristotle's view of life as
animation, a fundamental, irreducible property of nature; Descartes's
view of life as mechanism; and Kant's view of life as organization, to
which we need to add Darwin's concept of variation and evolution
through natural selection (Gayon 2010; Morange 2008).  In addition we
may add the idea of defining life as an emergent property of
particular kinds of complex systems (Weber 2010).


The focus of this entry is primarily the attempts to define life
during the twentieth century with the rise of biochemistry and
molecular biology. But this was the century that saw the rise of
artificial intelligence, artificial life, and complex systems theory
and so the concern includes these perspectives. Animate beings share a
range of properties and phenomena that are not seen together in
inanimate matter, although examples of matter exhibiting one or the
other of these can be found. Living entities metabolize, grow, die,
reproduce, respond, move, have complex organized functional
structures, heritable variability, and have lineages which can evolve
over generational time, producing new and emergent functional
structures that provide increased adaptive fitness in changing
environments.  Reproduction involves not only the replication of the
nucleic acids that carry the genetic information but the epigenetic
building of the organism through a sequence of developmental
steps. Such reproduction through development occurs within a larger
life-cycle of the organism, which includes its senescence and
death. Something that is alive has organized, complex structures that
carry out these functions as well as sensing and responding to
interior states and to the external environment and engaging in
movement within that environment. It must be remembered that
evolutionary phenomena are an inextricable aspect of living systems;
any attempt to define life in the absence of this diachronic
perspective will be futile. It will be argued below that living
systems may be defined as open systems maintained in steady-states,
far-from-equilibrium, due to matter-energy flows in which informed
(genetically) autocatalytic cycles extract energy, build complex
internal structures, allowing growth even as they create greater
entropy in their environments, and capable, over multigenerational
time. of evolution.

The Meaning of Life,0.7324801683425903,0.6587995290756226,"


Many major historical figures in philosophy have provided an answer to
the question of what, if anything, makes life meaningful, although
they typically have not put it in these terms. Consider, for instance,
Aristotle on the human function, Aquinas on the beatific vision, and
Kant on the highest good. While these concepts have some bearing on
happiness and morality, they are straightforwardly construed as
accounts of which final ends a person ought to realize in order to
have a life that matters. Despite the venerable pedigree, it is only
in the last 50 years or so that something approaching a distinct field
on the meaning of life has been established in Anglo-American
philosophy, and it is only in the last 30 years that debate with real
depth has appeared. Concomitant with the demise of positivism and of
utilitarianism in the post-war era has been the rise of analytical
enquiry into non-hedonistic conceptions of value, including
conceptions of meaning in life, grounded on relatively uncontroversial
(but not certain or universally shared) judgments of cases, often
called “intuitions.” English-speaking philosophers can be
expected to continue to find life's meaning of interest as they
increasingly realize that it is a distinct topic that admits of
rational enquiry to no less a degree than more familiar ethical
categories such as well-being, virtuous character, and right
action.


This survey critically discusses approaches to meaning in life that 
are prominent in contemporary Anglo-American philosophical 
literature. To provide context, sometimes it mentions other texts, 
e.g., in Continental philosophy or from before the 20th 
century. However, the central aim is to acquaint the reader with 
recent analytic work on life's meaning and to pose questions about it
that are currently worthy of consideration.


When the topic of the meaning of life comes up, people often pose one
of two questions: “So, what is the meaning of life?” and
“What are you talking about?” The literature can be
divided in terms of which question it seeks to answer. This discussion
starts off with works that address the latter, abstract question
regarding the sense of talk of “life's meaning,” i.e.,
that aim to clarify what we are asking when we pose the question of
what, if anything, makes life meaningful. Afterward, it considers
texts that provide answers to the more substantive question about the
nature of meaning as a property. Some accounts of what make life
meaningful provide particular ways to do so, e.g., by making certain
achievements (James 2005), developing moral character (Thomas 2005),
or learning from relationships with family members (Velleman
2005). However, most recent discussions of meaning in life are
attempts to capture in a single principle all the variegated
conditions that can confer meaning on life. This survey focuses
heavily on the articulation and evaluation of these theories of what
would make life meaningful. It concludes by examining nihilist views
that the conditions necessary for meaning in life do not obtain for
any of us, i.e., that all our lives are meaningless.

Linear logic is a refinement of classical and intuitionistic logic.
Instead of emphasizing truth, as in classical logic, or
proof, as in intuitionistic logic, linear logic emphasizes the
role of formulas as resources. To achieve this focus, linear
logic does not allow the usual structural rules of contraction and
weakening to apply to all formulas but only those formulas marked with
certain modals. Linear logic contains a fully involutive negation while
maintaining a strong constructive interpretation. Linear logic also
provides new insights into the nature of proofs in both classical and
intuitionistic logic. Given its focus on resources, linear logic has
found many applications in Computer Science.

Philosophy of Linguistics,0.765339732170105,0.6746091246604919,"


Philosophy of linguistics is the philosophy of science as applied to 
linguistics. This differentiates it sharply from the philosophy of 
language, traditionally concerned with matters of meaning and 
reference.


As with the philosophy of other special sciences, there are general 
topics relating to matters like methodology and explanation (e.g., 
the status of statistical explanations in psychology and sociology, 
or the physics-chemistry relation in philosophy of chemistry), and 
more specific philosophical issues that come up in the special 
science at issue (simultaneity for philosophy of physics; 
individuation of species and ecosystems for the philosophy of 
biology). General topics of the first type in the philosophy of 
linguistics include:

What the subject matter is,
What the theoretical goals are,
What form theories should take, and
What counts as data.



Specific topics include issues in language learnability, language 
change, the competence-performance distinction, and the expressive 
power of linguistic theories.


There are also topics that fall on the borderline between philosophy 
of language and philosophy of linguistics: of “linguistic 
relativity” (see the supplement on the linguistic relativity hypothesis 
  in the Summer 2015 archived version of the entry on 
 relativism),
 language vs. 
 idiolect,
 
 speech acts
 (including the distinction between locutionary, illocutionary, and 
perlocutionary acts), the language of thought, implicature, and the 
semantics of mental states (see the entries on 
 analysis,

  semantic compositionality,
 
 mental representation,
 
 pragmatics,
 and 
 defaults in semantics and pragmatics).
 In these cases it is often the kind of answer given and not the 
inherent nature of the topic itself that determines the 
classification. Topics that we consider to be more in the philosophy 
of language than the philosophy of linguistics include intensional 
contexts, direct reference, and empty names (see the entries on 
 propositional attitude reports,
 
 intensional logic,
 
 rigid designators,
 
 reference,
 and 
 descriptions).

The humanist and classical scholar Justus Lipsius (Joost Lips)

Montaigne as one of the most learned men of his day (Essays
II.12), was the founding father of Neostoicism, a key component of
European thought in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.


His famous and widely read Stoic dialogue De constantia was
an attempt to combine Stoicism and Christianity, producing a new
philosophy that would help individuals to live through the difficult
period of the religious wars and establishing constancy as the
most important of the virtues.


Lipsius's lifelong project was to transform contemporary moral
philosophy through a new reading of the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca,
while also revitalizing contemporary political practice by drawing on
the insights provided by the Roman historian Tacitus. Before publishing
his major edition of Seneca’s philosophical writings in the year
before his death, he wrote two theoretical treatises on Stoicism, which
provided the philosophical foundation for a new interpretation of
Seneca and a new understanding of Stoic doctrines.

Location and Mereology,0.8199211359024048,0.3147932291030884,"

Substantivalists believe that there are regions of space or
spacetime. Many substantivalists also believe that there are entities
(people, tables, social groups, electrons, fields, holes, events,
tropes, universals, …) that are located at regions.
These philosophers face questions about the relationship between
located entities and the regions at which they are located. Are
located entities identical to their locations, as
supersubstantivalists maintain? Are they entirely separate from their
locations, in the sense that they share no parts with them?

Without prejudging these metaphysical questions, some philosophers
have formulated logics of location—typically in the form
of groups of axioms or axiom-schemas governing a location relation and
its interaction with parthood and other mereological relations. One
main aim of these logics is to capture the ways in which the
mereological properties of and relations between located entities must
mirror the mereological properties of and relations between the
locations of those entities.

The recent literature focuses largely on three questions, each
corresponding to a different way in which the relevant mirroring might
fail:

Say that two entities interpenetrate just in case
they do not share parts but their exact locations do. Is
interpenetration possible?
Say that an extended simple is entity that has no
proper parts but is exactly located at a region that does have proper
parts. Are extended simples possible?
Say that an entity is multilocated just in case
it is exactly located at more than one region. Is multilocation
possible?

addresses a number of other issues along the way.

Alain LeRoy Locke is heralded as the “Father of the Harlem
Renaissance” for his publication in 1925 of The New
Negro—an anthology of poetry, essays, plays, music and
portraiture by white and black artists. Locke is best known as a theorist, critic, and interpreter of African-American literature and art. He was also a
creative and systematic philosopher who developed theories of value, pluralism and cultural relativism that informed and were reinforced by his work on aesthetics. Locke saw black aesthetics quite differently than some of the leading Negro intellectuals of his day; most notably W. E. B. Du Bois, with whom he disagreed about the appropriate social function of Negro artistic pursuits. Du Bois thought it was a role and responsibility of the Negro artist to offer a representation of the Negro and black experience which might help in the quest for social uplift. Locke criticized this as “propaganda” (AOP 12) and argued that the primary responsibility and function of the artist is to express his own individuality, and in doing that to communicate something of universal human appeal.


Locke was a distinguished scholar and educator and during his lifetime an
important philosopher of race and culture. Principal among his
contributions in these areas was the development of the notion of
“ethnic race”, Locke's conception of race as
primarily a matter of social and cultural, rather than biological,
heredity. Locke was in contemporary parlance a racial revisionist, and
held the somewhat controversial and paradoxical view that it was often
in the interests of groups to think and act as members of a
“race” even while they consciously worked for the
destruction or alteration of pernicious racial categories. Racial
designations were for Locke incomprehensible apart from an
understanding of the specific cultural and historical contexts in which
they grew up. A great deal of Locke's philosophical thinking and
writing in the areas of pluralism, relativism and democracy are aimed
at offering a more lucid understanding of cultural or racial
differences and prospects for more functional methods of navigating
contacts between different races and cultures.


Locke, like Du Bois, is often affiliated with the pragmatist
philosophical tradition though somewhat surprisingly—surprising
because Locke's actual views are closer substantively to pragmatist
thinkers Like Dewey, James, and Royce than are Du Bois's—he does
not receive as much attention in the writings of contemporary
pragmatist philosophers as does Du Bois.  Regardless, he is most
strongly identified with the pragmatist tradition, but his
“critical pragmatism”, and most specifically his value
theory, is also influenced by Hugo Münsterberg, F.S.C. Schiller,
Alexius Meinong, Frantz Brentano, and Christian von Erhenfels. From
early on in his education at Harvard University, Locke had an affinity
for the pragmatist tradition in philosophy. Locked developed his
mature views on axiology well in advance of many leading
pragmatists—e.g., Dewey and James.  Among pragmatists, Locke has
arguably the most developed and systematic philosophy of value, and
offers many critical insights concerning democracy.

John Locke,0.5610669851303101,0.3600313365459442,"

John Locke (b. 1632, d. 1704) was a British philosopher, Oxford
academic and medical researcher. Locke’s monumental An Essay
Concerning Human Understanding (1689) is one of the first great
defenses of modern empiricism and concerns itself with determining the
limits of human understanding in respect to a wide spectrum of topics.
It thus tells us in some detail what one can legitimately claim to
know and what one cannot. Locke’s association with Anthony
Ashley Cooper (later the First Earl of Shaftesbury) led him to become
successively a government official charged with collecting information
about trade and colonies, economic writer, opposition political
activist, and finally a revolutionary whose cause ultimately triumphed
in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Among Locke’s political
works he is most famous for The Second Treatise of Government
in which he argues that sovereignty resides in the people and explains
the nature of legitimate government in terms of natural rights and the
social contract. He is also famous for calling for the separation of
Church and State in his Letter Concerning Toleration. Much of
Locke’s work is characterized by opposition to authoritarianism.
This is apparent both on the level of the individual person and on the
level of institutions such as government and church. For the
individual, Locke wants each of us to use reason to search after truth
rather than simply accept the opinion of authorities or be subject to
superstition. He wants us to proportion assent to propositions to the
evidence for them. On the level of institutions it becomes important
to distinguish the legitimate from the illegitimate functions of
institutions and to make the corresponding distinction for the uses of
force by these institutions. Locke believes that using reason to try
to grasp the truth, and determine the legitimate functions of
institutions will optimize human flourishing for the individual and
society both in respect to its material and spiritual welfare. This in
turn, amounts to following natural law and the fulfillment of the
divine purpose for humanity.

Locke's Moral Philosophy,0.5587078928947449,0.3618718385696411,"

Locke's greatest philosophical work, An Essay Concerning Human
Understanding, is generally seen as a defining work of
seventeenth-century empiricist epistemology and metaphysics. The moral
philosophy developed in this work is rarely taken up for critical
analysis, considered by many scholars of Locke's thought to be too
obscure and confusing to be taken too seriously. The view is not only
seen by many commentators as incomplete, but it carries a degree of
rationalism that cannot be made consistent with our picture of Locke
as the arch-empiricist of his period. While it is true that Locke's
discussion of morality in the Essay is not as well-developed as
many of his other views, there is reason to think that morality was
the driving concern of this great work. For Locke, morality is the one
area apart from mathematics wherein human reasoning can attain a level
of rational certitude. For Locke, human reason may be weak with
regards to our understanding of the natural world and the workings of
the human mind, but it is exactly suited for the job of figuring out
human moral duty. By looking at Locke's moral philosophy, as it is
developed in the Essay and some of his earlier writings, we
gain a heightened appreciation for Locke's motivations in the
Essay, as well as a more nuanced understanding of the degree of
Locke's empiricism. Further than this, Locke's moral philosophy offers
us an important exemplar of seventeenth-century natural law theory,
probably the predominant moral view of the period.

Locke On Freedom,0.555108368396759,0.3569270372390747,"
John Locke’s views on the nature of freedom of action and
freedom of will have played an influential role in the philosophy of
action and in moral psychology. Locke offers distinctive accounts of
action and forbearance, of will and willing, of voluntary (as opposed
to involuntary) actions and forbearances, and of freedom (as opposed
to necessity). These positions lead him to dismiss the traditional
question of free will as absurd, but also raise new questions, such as
whether we are (or can be) free in respect of willing and whether we
are free to will what we will, questions to which he gives divergent
answers. Locke also discusses the (much misunderstood) question of
what determines the will, providing one answer to it at one time, and
then changing his mind upon consideration of some constructive
criticism proposed by his friend, William Molyneux. In conjunction
with this change of mind, Locke introduces a new doctrine (concerning
the ability to suspend the fulfillment of one’s desires) that
has caused much consternation among his interpreters, in part because
it threatens incoherence.  As we will see, Locke’s initial views
do suffer from clear difficulties that are remedied by his later
change of mind, all without introducing incoherence. 
 Note on the text: Locke’s theory of freedom is contained in
Book II, Chapter xxi of An Essay Concerning Human
Understanding. The chapter underwent five revisions in
Locke’s lifetime [E1 (1689), E2 (1694), E3 (1695), E4 (1700),
and E5 (1706)], with the last edition published posthumously.
Significant changes, including a considerable lengthening of the

Locke has been widely hailed for providing an epistemological
foundation for the experimental science of his day, articulating the
new, probabilistic form of knowledge appropriate to it.  But while he
is in important respects a devotee of that new science, there are also
significant tensions in his thought.  He stands behind its
experimental methods as he targets the earlier, speculative or
rationalist philosophies, for methodologies and epistemological
expectations unsuited to natural philosophy.  He also frequently
appears to embrace the new science’s corpuscular hypothesis, whose
powers and minute particles figure prominently in his attempt to
understand why we cannot hope for demonstrative certainty about
natural phenomena.  Yet the new science’s methodology was evolving.
Just how far did Locke travel with that evolution, and what aspects of
his thought prevented him from going further?  As for the corpuscular
hypothesis, what exactly was his stance toward it?  He frequently
speaks of particles and powers as if they belonged to established
knowledge, and yet in explaining the hypothesis’ flaws, he seems to
consider them fatal.  This article will mainly emphasize the second of
those related questions, though both have spurred scholarly
investigation and debate.

Locke's Political Philosophy,0.5599894523620605,0.36381995677948,"

John Locke (1632–1704) is among the most influential political
philosophers of the modern period. In the Two Treatises of
Government, he defended the claim that men are by nature free and
equal against claims that God had made all people naturally subject to
a monarch. He argued that people have rights, such as the right to
life, liberty, and property, that have a foundation independent of the
laws of any particular society. Locke used the claim that men are
naturally free and equal as part of the justification for
understanding legitimate political government as the result of a
social contract where people in the state of nature conditionally
transfer some of their rights to the government in order to better
ensure the stable, comfortable enjoyment of their lives, liberty, and
property. Since governments exist by the consent of the people in
order to protect the rights of the people and promote the public good,
governments that fail to do so can be resisted and replaced with new
governments. Locke is thus also important for his defense of the right
of revolution. Locke also defends the principle of majority rule and
the separation of legislative and executive powers. In the Letter
Concerning Toleration, Locke denied that coercion should be used
to bring people to (what the ruler believes is) the true religion and
also denied that churches should have any coercive power over their
members. Locke elaborated on these themes in his later political
writings, such as the Second Letter on Toleration and
Third Letter on Toleration.

Toleration, see

Algebraic Propositional Logic,0.8676835894584656,0.8173235654830933,"


[Editor's Note: The following entry replaces and is based on the former entry titled
 Propositional Consequence Relations and Algebraic Logic.]



George Boole was the first to present logic as a mathematical theory
in algebraic style. In his work, and in that of the other algebraists
of the algebraic tradition of logic of the nineteenth century, the
distinction between a formal language and a mathematically rigorous
semantics for it was still not drawn. What the algebraists in this
tradition did was to build algebraic theories (of Boolean algebras,
and relation algebras) with among other interpretations a logical one.


The works of Frege and Russell introduced a different perspective on
the way to approach logic. In those works, a logic system was given by
a formal language and a deductive calculus, namely a set of axioms and
a set of inference rules. Let us (for this entry) call such a pair a
logical deduction system, and the formulas derivable in the
calculus its theorems (nowadays it is common practice in
algebraic logic to refer to this kind of calculi as Hilbert-style and
in proof complexity theory as Frege systems). In Frege and
Russell’s approach, a formal (mathematical) semantics of
whatever kind (algebraic, model-theoretic, etc.) for the formal
languages they used was lacking. The only semantics present was of an
intuitive, informal kind. 

The systems introduced by Frege and Russell were systems of classical
logic, but soon after systems of non-classical logics were considered
by other logicians. The first influential attempts to introduce logics
different from classical logic remained within the Frege-Russell
tradition of presenting a logical deduction system without any formal
semantics. These attempts lead to the first modal systems of C.I.
Lewis (1918, 1932) and to the
axiomatization of intuitionistic logic by Heyting (1930).

The idea underlying the design of Frege and Russell’s logical
deduction systems is that the theorems should be the formulas that
correspond (intuitively) to the logical truths or logical validities.
The concept of logical consequence was not central to the development,
and this was also the case in the many systems of non-classical logics
that were to be designed following in the footsteps of the first modal
systems of C.I. Lewis. This situation influenced the way in which the
research on some non-classical logics has usually been presented and
sometimes also its real evolution. However, the concept of logical
consequence has been the one that logic has traditionally dealt with.
Tarski put it once again into the center of modern logic, both
semantically and syntactically. Nowadays, a general theory of the
algebraization of logics around the concept of logical consequence has
grown from the different algebraic treatments of the different logics
obtained during the last century. 

The concept of logical consequence has proved much more fruitful than
those of theorem and of logical validity for the development of such a
general theory. The first attempts in the process of building the
general theory of the algebraization of logics can be found in the
study of the class of implicative logics by Rasiowa (1974) and in the
systematic presentation by Wójcicki (1988) of the
investigations of a general nature on propositional logics as
consequence operations carried out mainly by Polish logicians,
following the studies of Tarski, Lindenbaum, Łukasiewicz and
others in the first part of the twentieth century. 

It was only in the 1920s that algebras and logical matrices (an
algebra together with a set of designated elements) started to be
taken as models of logical deduction systems, that is, as providing a
formal semantics for formal languages of logic. Moreover, they were
also used to define sets of formulas with similar properties to the
ones the sets of theorems of the known logical deduction systems have,
in particular the property of being closed under substitution
instances; more recently logical matrices have also been used to
define logics as consequence relations. 

Algebraic logic can be described in very general terms as the
discipline that studies logics by associating with them classes of
algebras, classes of logical matrices and other algebra related
mathematical structures and that relates the properties that the
logics may have with properties of the associated algebras (or algebra
related structures) with the purpose that the understanding of these
algebras can be used to better understand the logic at hand. 

From the algebraic study of particular logics a general theory of the
algebraization of logics slowly emerged during the last century with
the aim, more or less explicitly stated during the process, of
obtaining general and informative results relating the properties a
logic may have with the algebraic properties the class of algebras (or
algebra related structures) associated with it might enjoy. Those
algebraic studies assumed somehow an implicit conception of what is
the process by which to associate with any given logic a class of
algebras as its natural algebraic counterpart. The development of the
general theory speeded up and consolidated at the beginning of the
1980s with the introduction of the notion of algebraizable logic, and
at that time the assumptions about the class of algebras that deserve
to be taken as the natural to associate with a given logic started to
be made more and more explicit. 

In this entry we concentrate on the general theory of the
algebraization of propositional logics taken as consequence relations.
This theory has evolved into the field known as Abstract Algebraic
Logic (AAL). The entry can be taken as a mild introduction to this
field.

Ancient Logic,0.6901655197143555,0.12976591289043427,"


Logic as a discipline starts with the transition from the more or less
unreflective use of logical methods and argument patterns to the
reflection on and inquiry into these methods and patterns and their
elements, including the syntax and semantics of sentences. In Greek
and Roman antiquity, discussions of some elements of logic and a focus
on methods of inference can be traced back to the late 5th
century BCE.  The Sophists, and later Plato (early 4th c.)
displayed an interest in sentence analysis, truth, and fallacies, and
Eubulides of Miletus (mid-4th c.) is on record as the
inventor of both the Liar and the Sorites paradox. But logic as a
fully systematic discipline begins with Aristotle, who systematized
much of the logical inquiry of his predecessors. His main achievements
were his theory of the logical interrelation of affirmative and
negative existential and universal statements and, based on this
theory, his syllogistic, which can be interpreted as a system of
deductive inference.  Aristotle's logic is known as term-logic, since
it is concerned with the logical relations between terms, such as
‘human being’, ‘animal’,
‘white’. It shares elements with both set theory and
predicate logic. Aristotle's successors in his school, the Peripatos,
notably Theophrastus and Eudemus, widened the scope of deductive
inference and improved some aspects of Aristotle's logic.


In the Hellenistic period, and apparently independent of Aristotle's
achievements, the logician Diodorus Cronus and his pupil Philo (see
the entry
 Dialectical school)
 worked out the beginnings of a logic that took propositions, rather
than terms, as its basic elements. They influenced the second major
theorist of logic in antiquity, the Stoic Chrysippus
(mid-3rd c.), whose main achievement is the development of
a propositional logic, crowned by a deductive system. Regarded by many
in antiquity as the greatest logician, he was innovative in a large
number of topics that are central to contemporary formal and
philosophical logic. The many close similarities between Chrysippus'
philosophical logic and that of Gottlob Frege are especially
striking. Chrysippus' Stoic successors systematized his logic, and
made some additions.


The development of logic from c. 100 BCE to c. 250 CE remains mostly
in the dark, but there can be no doubt that logic was one of the
topics regularly studied and researched. At some point Peripatetics
and Stoics began taking notice of each other's logical systems, and we
witness some conflation of both terminologies and theories.
Aristotelian syllogistic became known as ‘categorical
syllogistic’ and the Peripatetic adaptation of Stoic syllogistic
as ‘hypothetical syllogistic’. In the 2nd
century CE, Galen attempted to synthesize the two traditions; he also
professed to have introduced a third kind of syllogism, the
‘relational syllogism’, which apparently was meant to help
formalize mathematical reasoning. The attempt of some Middle
Platonists (1st c. BCE–2nd c. CE) to claim
a specifically Platonic logic failed, and in its stead, the
Neo-Platonists (3rd–6th c. CE) adopted a
scholasticized version of Aristotelian logic as their own. In the
monumental—if rarely creative—volumes of the Greek
commentators on Aristotle's logical works we find elements of Stoic
and later Peripatetic logic as well as Platonism, and ancient
mathematics and rhetoric. Much the same holds for the Latin logical
writings by Apuleius (2nd c. CE) and Boethius
(6th c. CE), which pave the way for Aristotelian logic,
thus supplemented, to enter the Medieval era.

Logic of Belief Revision,0.732360303401947,0.7667508721351624,"

In the logic of belief revision (belief change), a belief state (or
database) is represented by a set of sentences. The major operations
of change are those consisting in the introduction or removal of a
belief-representing sentence. In both cases, changes affecting other
sentences may be needed (for instance in order to retain consistency).
Rationality postulates for such operations have been proposed, and
representation theorems have been obtained that characterize specific
types of operations in terms of these postulates.

In the dominant theory of belief revision, the so-called AGM model,
the set representing the belief state is assumed to be a logically
closed set of sentences (a belief set). One of most debated
topics in belief revision theory is the recovery postulate, according
to which all the original beliefs are regained if one of them is first
removed and then reinserted. The recovery postulate holds in the AGM
model but not in closely related models employing belief bases.
Another much discussed topic is how repeated changes can be adequately
represented. Several alternative models have been proposed that are
intended to provide a more realistic account of belief change than
that offered by the AGM model.

Classical Logic,0.7953829765319824,0.8433778882026672,"


Typically, a logic consists of a formal or informal language
together with a deductive system and/or a model-theoretic semantics.
The language has components that correspond to a part of a natural language like
English or Greek. The deductive system is to capture, codify, or
simply record arguments that are valid for the given
language, and the semantics is to capture, codify, or record the
meanings, or truth-conditions for at least part of the language.

 The following sections provide the basics of a typical logic,
sometimes called “classical elementary logic” or “classical
first-order logic”. Section 2 develops a formal language, with a
rigorous syntax and grammar. The formal language is a recursively
defined collection of strings on a fixed alphabet. As such, it has
no meaning, or perhaps better, the meaning of its formulas is given
by the deductive system and the semantics. Some of the symbols have
counterparts in ordinary language. We define an argument to
be a non-empty collection of sentences in the formal language, one of
which is designated to be the conclusion. The other sentences (if
any) in an argument are its premises. Section 3 sets up a deductive
system for the language, in the spirit of natural deduction. An
argument is derivable if there is a deduction from some or all of
its premises to its conclusion. Section 4 provides a model-theoretic
semantics. An argument is valid if there is no
interpretation (in the semantics) in which its premises are all true
and its conclusion false. This reflects the longstanding view that a
valid argument is truth-preserving.

 In Section 5, we turn to relationships between the deductive system
and the semantics, and in particular, the relationship between
derivability and validity. We show that an argument is derivable only
if it is valid. This pleasant feature, called soundness,
entails that no deduction takes one from true premises to a false
conclusion. Thus, deductions preserve truth. Then we establish a converse, called
completeness, that an argument is valid only if it is
derivable. This establishes that the deductive system is rich enough
to provide a deduction for every valid argument. So there are enough
deductions: all and only valid arguments are derivable. We briefly
indicate other features of the logic, some of which are corollaries to
soundness and completeness.

The final section, Section 6, is devoted to the a brief examination of
the philosophical position that classical logic is “the one right
logic”.

Combinatory Logic,0.8871053457260132,0.8406465649604797,"

Combinatory logic (henceforth: CL) is an elegant and
powerful logical theory that is connected to many areas of
logic, and has found applications in other disciplines, especially, in
computer science and mathematics.

CL was originally invented as a continuation of the reduction of the
set of logical constants to a singleton set in classical first-order
logic (FOL). CL untangles the problem of substitution, because
formulas can be prepared for the elimination of bound variables
by inserting combinators. Philosophically speaking, an expression that
has no bound variables represents the logical form of the original
formula. Sometimes, bound variables are thought to signify
“ontological commitments.”
Another philosophical rôle of CL is to show the variability of
the ontological assumptions a theory has.

Substitution is a crucial operation not only in first-order logics,
but also in higher-order logics,
as well as in other formal systems that contain a variable binding
operator, such as the \(\lambda\)-calculi and the \(\varepsilon\)-calculus.
Indeed, carrying out substitution correctly is particularly pressing in
\(\lambda\)-calculi
and in the closely related functional programming languages. CL can
emulate \(\lambda\)-abstraction despite the fact that CL has no variable
binding operators. This makes CL a suitable target language for
functional programming languages to be compiled into.

The connection to \(\lambda\)-calculi might suggest—correctly—that
CL is sufficiently expressive to formalize
recursive functions
(i.e., computable functions) and arithmetic. Consequently, CL is
susceptible to 
Gödel-type incompleteness theorems.

CL is an archetypical term rewriting system (TRS). These
systems comprise a wide range of formal calculi from syntactic
specifications of programming languages and context-free grammars to
Markov algorithms; even some number theoretic problems may be viewed
as special instances of questions about TRSs. Several notions and
proof techniques that were originally invented for CL, later turned
out to be useful in applications to less well-understood TRSs.

CL is connected to nonclassical logics via typing. First, a
correspondence between formulas that are provable in the implicational
fragment of intuitionistic logic and the typable combinatory terms was
discovered. Then the isomorphism was generalized to other combinatory
bases and implicational logics (such as the logic of relevant
implication, exponential-free linear logic, affine logic, etc.).

Self-reference factors into some paradoxes, such as the widely known
liar paradox
and
Russell's paradox.
The set theoretical understanding of functions also discourages the
idea of self-application. Thus it is remarkable that pure untyped CL
does not exclude the self-application of functions. Moreover, its
mathematical models showed that a theory in which functions can become
their own arguments is completely sensible, in addition to being
consistent (what was established earlier using proof theoretic
methods).

Combining Logics,0.844308078289032,0.8281099796295166,"

The subject of combinations of logics is still a young topic in
contemporary logic. Besides the pure philosophical interest offered by
the possibility of defining mixed logic systems in which distinct
operators obey logics of different nature, as for instance erotetic
logics (the logical analysis of questions) which require combining
epistemic and deontic logics, there also exist many pragmatical and
methodological reasons for considering combined logics. In fact, the
use of formal logic as a tool for knowledge representation in Computer
Science frequently requires the integration of several logic systems
into a homogeneous environment.

Important questions in the philosophy of logic such as: “why are
there so many logics instead of just one?” (or even, instead of
none), as for instance, raised in Epstein 1995, can be naturally
counterposed by several other questions: if there are indeed many
logics, are they excluding alternatives, or are they compatible? Is it
possible to combine different logics into coherent systems with the
purpose of using them in applications and to shed some light on the
properties of complex logics? Moreover, if we can compose
logics, why not decompose them? And, if a logic is
decomposed into elementary sublogics, is it possible to recover it by
combining such fragments? What kind of properties of logics can be
transferred to their combinations? Questions of this kind have been
only partially tackled in the literature, and reflect challenges to be
confronted in the evolution of this topic.

Connexive Logic,0.8448783159255981,0.8023431301116943,"


Connexive logic is a comparatively little-known and to some extent
neglected branch of non-classical logic. Systems of connexive logic are
neither subsystems nor extensions of classical logic. Connexive logics
have a standard logical vocabulary and comprise certain non-theorems
of classical logic as theses. Since classical propositional logic is
Post-complete, any additional axiom in its language gives rise to the
trivial system, so that any non-trivial system of connexive logic will
have to leave out some theorems of classical logic. The name
‘connexive logic’ suggests 
that systems of connexive logic are motivated by some ideas about coherence 
or connection between premises and conclusions of valid inferences or between 
formulas of a certain shape. The kind of coherence in question concerns the 
meaning of implication and negation (see the entries on  
conditionals and 
negation).

One basic idea is that no formula provably implies or is implied by
its own negation. This conception may be expressed by requiring that
for every formula A,

 ⊬
 ~A → A and
 ⊬
 A
→ ~ A,


 
but usually the underlying intuitions are expressed by requiring that
certain schematic formulas are theorems:
 

AT: ~(~A →A) and
AT′: ~(A→ ~A).  

The first formula is often called Aristotle's Thesis. If this
non-theorem of classical logic is found plausible, then the second
principle, AT′, would seem to enjoy the same degree of
plausibility. Indeed, also AT′ is sometimes referred to as
Aristotle's Thesis. As McCall (1975, 435) explains, 
[c]onnexive logic
may be seen as an attempt to formalize the species of implication
recommended by Chrysippus: 
   And those who introduce the notion of connection say that a
conditional is sound when the contradictory of its consequent is
incompatible with its antecedent. (Sextus Empiricus, translated in
Kneale and Kneale 1962, p. 129.)
   


Using intuitionistically acceptable means only, the pair of theses AT
and AT′ is equivalent in deductive power with another pair of
schemata, which in established terminology are called (Strong)
Boethius' Theses and which may be viewed (in addition with
their converses) as capturing Chrysippus' idea: 


BT: (A →B) → ~(A →
~B) and BT′: (A→ ~B)
→ ~ (A→B).  


The names ‘Aristotle's Theses’ and ‘Boethius'
Theses’ are, of course, not arbitrarily chosen. AT, for example,
is assumed at Aristotle's Prior Analytics 57b14,
where it is explained that:

It is impossible that if A, then not-A. 

Moreover, Boethius, for instance, holds that ‘if A then
~B’ is the negation of ‘if A, then
B’ (Kneale and Kneale 1962, p. 191). Additional
historical remarks may be found in Kneale and Kneale 1962, Priest
1999, Nasti De Vincentis 2002, and McCall 2012, where McCall refers to
~((A →B) ∧ (~A →B))
as Aristotle's Second Thesis and, following Martin 2004, to
~((A →B) ∧ (A →~B))
as Abelard's First Principle.  Aristotle's Second Thesis and
Abelard's First Principle are interderivable with BT and with
BT′ using intuitionistic principles only.




Let L be a language containing a unary connective ~
(negation) and a binary connective → (implication). A logical
system in a language extending L is called a connexive
logic if AT, AT′, BT, and BT′ are theorems and,
moreover, (A→B) →
(B→A) fails to be a theorem (so that → can
hardly be understood as a bi-conditional). The connective → in a
system of connexive logic is said to be a connexive
implication.  Kapsner (2012) refers to a logic that satisfies AT,
AT′, BT, and BT′ and, moreover, satisfies the requirement
that (a) in no model A→~A is satisfiable (for
any A) and (b) in no model A→B and
A→~B are simultaneoulsy satisfiable (for any
A and B), as strongly connexive, whereas if
the conditions (a) and (b) are not both satisfied, the system is only
called weakly connexive.

Deontic Logic,0.8362929821014404,0.7846142053604126,"


Deontic 
 logic[1]
 is that branch of symbolic logic that has been the most concerned
with the contribution that the following notions make to what follows
from what:



permissible (permitted)
     
must


impermissible (forbidden, prohibited)
     
supererogatory (beyond the call of duty)


obligatory (duty, required)
     
indifferent / significant


omissible (non-obligatory)
     
the least one can do


optional
     
better than / best / good / bad


ought
     
claim / liberty / power / immunity





To be sure, some of these notions have received more attention in
deontic logic than others. However, virtually everyone working in this
area would see systems designed to model the logical contributions of
these notions as part of deontic logic proper.


As a branch of symbolic logic, deontic logic is of
theoretical interest for some of the same reasons that modal
logic is of theoretical interest. However, despite the fact that we
need to be cautious about making too easy a link between deontic logic
and practicality, many of the notions listed are typically
employed in attempting to regulate and coordinate our lives together
(but also to evaluate states of affairs). For these reasons, deontic
logics often directly involve topics of considerable practical
significance such as morality, law, social and business organizations
(their norms, as well as their normative constitution), and security
systems. To that extent, studying the logic of notions with such
practical significance adds some practical significance to
deontic logic itself.

Dependence Logic,0.8571169972419739,0.7995947003364563,"

Dependence logic is an extension of first-order logic which adds to it
dependence atoms, that is, expressions of the form
\(\eqord(x_1 \ldots x_n, y)\) which assert that the value of \(y\) is
functionally dependent on (in other words, determined by) the values
of \(x_1 \ldots x_n\). These atoms permit the specification of
non-linearly ordered dependency patterns between variables,
much in the same sense of IF-Logic slashed quantifiers; but,
differently from IF-logic, dependence logic separates quantification
from the specification of such dependence/independence conditions. The
principal semantics of dependence logic, called team
semantics, generalizes Tarski’s semantics by letting
expressions be satisfied or not satisfied with respect to
sets of variable assignments rather than with respect to
single assignments. This semantics pre-dates the development of
dependence logic proper, and it was originally developed by Wilfrid
Hodges in the context of IF-logic (Hodges 1997). There also exists a
game-theoretic semantics for dependence logic, based on games of
imperfect information and roughly analogous to the game-theoretic
semantics for independence-friendly logic (Väänänen
2007a). Sensu stricto, the term “dependence
logic” refers exclusively to the language obtained by adding the
above-mentioned functional dependence atoms to the language of
first-order logic; but the term is also used, in a more general sense,
to refer to the the area of research that studies the properties of
logics obtained by adding various notions of dependence and
independence to first order logic, such as independence
logic (Grädel & Väänänen 2013),
intuitionistic dependence logic (Yang 2013) or inclusion
logic (Galliani 2012, Galliani & Hella 2013), or even those
of logics extending other logical frameworks through similar
atoms, as in the case of modal dependence logic
(Väänänen 2008). In this article, the term
“dependence logic” will be used to refer to dependence
logic proper, and the term “logics of dependence and
independence” will instead be used to refer to its variants and
generalizations.

Free Logic,0.8554251194000244,0.7925671339035034,"


Classical logic requires each singular term to denote an object in the
domain of quantification—which is usually understood as the set
of “existing” objects. Free logic does not. Free logic is therefore
useful for analyzing discourse containing singular terms that either
are or might be empty. A term is empty if it either has no referent
or refers to an object outside the domain.
Most free logics have been first-order, their quantifiers ranging over
individuals. Recently, however, some work on higher-order free logics has appeared. Corine Besson (2009) argues that internalist theories of natural kinds require second-order free logics whose quantifiers range over kinds, and she finds precedent for this idea ranging as far back as Cocchiarella (1986). Andrew Bacon, John Hawthorne, and Gabriel Uzquiano (2016) explore the possibility of using a higher-order free logic to resolve certain intensional paradoxes, but they find that this idea faces daunting difficulties. Timothy Williamson (2016) reluctantly concurs. This article, however, focuses mainly on first-order logics.


Section 1 lays out the basics of free logic, explaining how it
differs from classical predicate logic and how it is related to
inclusive logic, which permits empty domains or
“worlds.” Section 2 shows how free logic may be
represented by each of three formal methods: axiom systems,
natural deduction rules and tree rules. Varying conventions for
calculating the truth values of atomic formulas containing empty
singular terms yield three distinct forms of free logic:
negative, positive and neutral. These are surveyed in Section 3, along with supervaluations, which were developed to augment neutral
logics. Section 4 is critical, examining three anomalies that
infect most free logics. Section 5 samples applications of free logic to
theories of description, logics of partial or non-strict functions,
logics with Kripke semantics, logics of fiction and logics that are in
a certain sense Meinongian. Section 6 takes a glance at free
logic’s history.

Fuzzy Logic,0.8399622440338135,0.8423414826393127,"


[Editor's Note: The following new entry by Petr Cintula, Christian
G. Fermüller, and Carles Noguera replaces the
 former entry
on this topic by the previous author.]



Fuzzy logic is intended to model logical reasoning with vague or
imprecise statements like “Petr is young (rich, tall, hungry,
etc.)”. It refers to a family of many-valued logics (see entry
on
 many-valued logic)
 and thus stipulates that the truth value (which, in this case amounts
to a degree of truth) of a logically compound proposition, like
“Carles is tall and Chris is rich”, is determined by the
truth value of its components. In other words, like in classical
logic, one imposes truth-functionality.

Fuzzy logic emerged in the context of the theory of fuzzy sets,
introduced by Zadeh (1965). A fuzzy set assigns a degree of
membership, typically a real number from the interval \([0,1]\), to
elements of a universe. Fuzzy logic arises by assigning degrees of
truth to propositions. The standard set of truth values (degrees) is
\([0,1]\), where \(0\) represents “totally false”, \(1\)
represents “totally true”, and the other numbers refer to
partial truth, i.e., intermediate degrees of
 truth.[1]


“Fuzzy logic” is often understood in a very wide sense
which includes all kinds of formalisms and techniques referring to the
systematic handling of degrees of some kind (see, e.g.,
Nguyen & Walker 2000). In particular in engineering contexts
(fuzzy control, fuzzy classification, soft computing) it is aimed at
efficient computational methods tolerant to suboptimality and
imprecision (see, e.g., Ross 2010). This entry focuses on fuzzy logic
in a narrow sense, established as a discipline of mathematical logic
following the seminal monograph by Petr Hájek (1998) and
nowadays usually referred to as “mathematical fuzzy logic”
(see Cintula, Fermüller, Hájek, & Noguera 2011 and
2015). It focuses on logics based on a truth-functional account of
partial truth and studies them in the spirit of classical mathematical
logic (syntax, model theoretic semantics, proof systems, completeness,
etc.; both, at propositional and the predicate level).

Independence Friendly Logic,0.8653594851493835,0.8381598591804504,"

Independence friendly logic (IF logic, IF first-order logic) is an
extension of first-order logic. In it, more quantifier dependencies
and independencies can be expressed than in first-order logic. Its
quantifiers range over individuals only; semantically IF first-order
logic, however, has the same expressive power as existential
second-order logic. IF logic lacks certain metaproperties that
first-order logic has (axiomatizability, Tarski-type semantics). On
the other hand, IF logic admits a self-applied truth-predicate –
a property that first-order logic notoriously does not enjoy.
Philosophical issues discussed in connection with IF logic include
reformulating the logicist program, the question of truth in axiomatic
set theory, and the nature of negation. Work in IF logic has also
inspired alternative generalizations of first-order logic: slash logic
and
 dependence logic.

Infinitary Logic,0.8874251842498779,0.7472292184829712,"


Traditionally, expressions in formal systems have been regarded as
signifying finite inscriptions which are—at least in
principle—capable of actually being written out in primitive
notation. However, the fact that (first-order) formulas may be
identified with natural numbers (via “Gödel
numbering”) and hence with finite sets makes it no
longer necessary to regard formulas as inscriptions, and suggests the
possibility of fashioning “languages” some of whose
formulas would be naturally identified as infinite sets. A
“language” of this kind is called an infinitary
language: in this article I discuss those infinitary languages
which can be obtained in a straightforward manner from first-order
languages by allowing conjunctions, disjunctions and, possibly,
quantifier sequences, to be of infinite length. In the course of the
discussion it will be seen that, while the expressive power of such
languages far exceeds that of their finitary (first-order)
counterparts, very few of them possess the “attractive”
features (e.g., compactness and completeness) of the
latter. Accordingly, the infinitary languages that do in fact possess
these features merit special attention.



In §1 the basic syntax and semantics of infinitary languages are
laid down; their expressive power is then displayed by means of
examples.  §2 is devoted to those infinitary languages which
permit only finite quantifier sequences: these languages turn out to
be relatively well-behaved. §3 is devoted to a discussion of
the compactness problem for infinitary languages and its
connection with purely set-theoretical questions concerning
“large” cardinal numbers. In §4 an argument is
sketched which shows that most “infinite quantifier”
languages have a second-order nature and are, ipso
facto, highly incomplete. §5 provides a brief account of a
certain special class of sublanguages of infinitary languages for
which a satisfactory generalization of the compactness theorem can be
proved. This section includes a subsection on the definition of
admissible sets. Historical and bibliographical remarks are provided
in §6.

Many-Valued Logic,0.855981707572937,0.8166077733039856,"


Many-valued logics are non-classical logics. They are similar to
classical logic because they accept the principle of
truth-functionality, namely, that the truth of a compound sentence is
determined by the truth values of its component sentences (and so
remains unaffected when one of its component sentences is replaced by
another sentence with the same truth value). But they differ from
classical logic by the fundamental fact that they do not restrict the
number of truth values to only two: they allow for a larger set
\(W\) of truth degrees.
 Just as the notion of ‘possible worlds’ in the
semantics of modal logic can be reinterpreted (e.g., as ‘moments
of time’ in the semantics of tense logic or as
‘states’ in the semantics of dynamic logic), there does
not exist a standard interpretation of the truth degrees. How they are
to be understood depends on the actual field of application. It is
general usage, however, to assume that there are two particular truth
degrees, usually denoted by “0” and “1”. These
particular truth degrees act, respectively, like the traditional truth
values “falsum” and “verum” – but
sometimes also like “absolutely false” and
“absolutely true”, particularly in cases in which the
traditional truth values of classical logic “split” into a
series of truth degrees.

Many-valued logics treat their truth degrees as technical tools, and
intend to choose them suitably for particular applications. It is a
rather difficult philosophical problem to discuss the (possible,
non-technical) nature of such “truth degrees” or
“truth values”. The interested reader can consult the
monograph Shramko/Wansing (2011) or the entry on 
 truth values.


The formalized languages for systems of many-valued logic
(MVL) follow the two standard patterns for propositional and predicate
logic, respectively:

there are propositional variables
together with connectives and (possibly also) truth degree constants in
the case of propositional languages,

there are object variables together with predicate symbols, possibly
also object constants and function symbols, as well as quantifiers,
connectives, and (possibly also) truth degree constants in the case of
first-order languages.



As usual in logic, these languages are the basis for semantically as
well as syntactically founded systems of logic.

related systems. These include logics for belief, for tense and other
temporal expressions, for the deontic (moral) expressions such as
‘it is obligatory that’ and ‘it is permitted
that’, and many others. An understanding of modal logic is

Non-monotonic Logic,0.8060141205787659,0.8080434203147888,"

The term “non-monotonic logic” (in short, NML) covers a family of
formal frameworks devised to capture and represent defeasible
inference, i.e., that kind of inference in which reasoners draw
conclusions tentatively, reserving the right to retract them in the
light of further information.  Examples are numerous, reaching from
inductive generalizations to abduction to inferences on the basis of
expert opinion, etc. We find defeasible inferences in everyday
reasoning, in expert reasoning (e.g. medical diagnosis), and in
scientific reasoning.


Defeasible reasoning just like
deductive reasoning, can follow complex patterns. However, such
patterns are beyond reach for classical logic (CL), intuitionistic
logic (IL) or other logics that characterize deductive reasoning since
they—by their very nature—do not allow for a retraction
of inferences. The challenge tackled in the domain of NMLs is to
provide for defeasible reasoning forms what CL or IL provide for
mathematical reasoning: namely a formally precise account that
is materially adequate, where material adequacy concerns the
question of how broad a range of examples is captured by the
framework, and the extent to which the framework can do justice to our
intuitions on the subject (at least the most entrenched ones).

Paraconsistent Logic,0.8457757234573364,0.8126253485679626,"

Contemporary logical orthodoxy has it that, from contradictory
premises, anything follows. A logical consequence relation is
explosive if according to it any arbitrary conclusion \(B\)
is entailed by any arbitrary contradiction \(A\), \(\neg A\) (ex
contradictione quodlibet (ECQ)). Classical logic, and most
standard ‘non-classical’ logics too such as intuitionist
logic, are explosive. Inconsistency, according to received wisdom,
cannot be coherently reasoned about. 

Paraconsistent logic challenges this orthodoxy. A logical consequence
relation is said to be paraconsistent if it is not explosive.
Thus, if a consequence relation is paraconsistent, then even in
circumstances where the available information is inconsistent, the
consequence relation does not explode into triviality. Thus,
paraconsistent logic accommodates inconsistency in a controlled way
that treats inconsistent information as potentially informative. 

The prefix ‘para’ in English has two meanings:
‘quasi’ (or ‘similar to, modelled on’) or
‘beyond’. When the term ‘paraconsistent’ was
coined by Miró Quesada at the Third Latin America Conference on
Mathematical Logic in 1976, he seems to have had the first meaning in
mind. Many paraconsistent logicians, however, have taken it to mean
the second, which provided different reasons for the development of
paraconsistent logic as we will see below. 

Paraconsistent logic is defined negatively: any logic is
paraconsistent as long as it is not explosive. This means there is no
single set of open problems or programs in paraconsistent logic. As
such, this entry is not a complete survey of paraconsistent logic. The

Propositional Dynamic Logic,0.8732702732086182,0.7830342054367065,"


Logics of programs are modal logics arising from the idea of
associating with each computer program α of a programming
language a modality [α].  This idea stems from the line of works
by Engeler [1967], Hoare [1969], Yanov [1959], and others who
formulated and studied logical languages in which the properties of
program connectives can be expressed.  The algorithmic logic (AL)
first developed by Salwicki [1970] and the dynamic logic (DL)
elaborated by Pratt [1976] are proper continuations of these works. We
will here concentrate on DL. The numerous papers devoted to DL and its
variants as well as its multifarious applications in program
verification and data structures show that it constitutes a useful
tool in studying properties of programs. Pratt chose to depict DL on
what one might call the first-order level, and it was his work that
triggered Fischer and Ladner [1979] to define the propositional variant
of DL a couple of years later. This article presents an introduction
to PDL, the propositional variant of DL.

Provability Logic,0.8688289523124695,0.8048364520072937,"

Provability logic is a modal logic that is used to investigate what
arithmetical theories can express in a restricted language about their
provability predicates. The logic has been inspired by developments in
meta-mathematics such as Gödel’s incompleteness theorems of 1931
and Löb’s theorem of 1953. As a modal logic, provability logic
has been studied since the early seventies, and has had important
applications in the foundations of mathematics.

From a philosophical point of view, provability logic is interesting
because the concept of provability in a fixed theory of arithmetic has
a unique and non-problematic meaning, other than concepts like
necessity and knowledge studied in modal and epistemic logic.
Furthermore, provability logic provides tools to study the notion of
self-reference.

Relevance Logic,0.8425410389900208,0.7956738471984863,"

Relevance logics are non-classical logics. Called
‘relevant logics’ in Britain and Australasia, these
systems developed as attempts to avoid the paradoxes of material and
strict implication.  Among the paradoxes of material implication
are

p → (q → p).
¬p → (p → q).
(p → q)
 ∨(q
 → r).



Among the paradoxes of strict implication are the following:

(p & ¬p) → q.
p → (q → q).
 p → (q
 ∨¬q).



Many philosophers, beginning with Hugh MacColl (1908), have claimed
that these theses are counterintuitive. They claim that these formulae
fail to be valid if we interpret → as representing the concept of
implication that we have before we learn classical logic. Relevance
logicians claim that what is unsettling about these so-called
paradoxes is that in each of them the antecedent seems irrelevant to
the consequent.


In addition, relevance logicians have had qualms about certain
inferences that classical logic makes valid. For example, consider the
classically valid inference


The moon is made of green cheese. Therefore, either it is raining in
Ecuador now or it is not.


Again here there seems to be a failure of relevance. The conclusion
seems to have nothing to do with the premise. Relevance logicians have
attempted to construct logics that reject theses and arguments that
commit “fallacies of relevance”.


Relevant logicians point out that what is wrong with some of the
paradoxes (and fallacies) is that is that the antecedents and
consequents (or premises and conclusions) are on completely different
topics. The notion of a topic, however, would seem not to be something
that a logician should be interested in — it has to do with the
content, not the form, of a sentence or inference. But there is a
formal principle that relevant logicians apply to force theorems and
inferences to “stay on topic”. This is the variable
sharing principle. The variable sharing principle says that no
formula of the form A → B can be proven in a relevance logic if A
and B do not have at least one propositional variable (sometimes
called a proposition letter) in common and that no inference can be
shown valid if the premises and conclusion do not share at least one
propositional variable.


At this point some confusion is natural about what relevant logicians
are attempting to do. The variable sharing principle is only a
necessary condition that a logic must have to count as a relevance
logic. It is not sufficient. Moreover, this principle does not give us
a criterion that eliminates all of the paradoxes and fallacies. Some
remain paradoxical or fallacious even though they satisfy variable
sharing. As we shall see, however, relevant logic does provide us with
a relevant notion of proof in terms of the real use of premises (see
the section “Proof Theory” below), but it does not by
itself tell us what counts as a true (and relevant) implication. It is
only when the formal theory is put together with a philosophical
interpretation that it can do this (see the section
“Semantics for Relevant Implication” below).


In this article we will give a brief and relatively non-technical
overview of the field of relevance logic.

Second-order and Higher-order Logic,0.8806458115577698,0.7488902807235718,"


Second-order logic is an extension of first-order logic where, in
addition to quantifiers such as “for every object (in the
universe of discourse),” one has quantifiers such as “for
every property of objects (in the universe of discourse).”
  This augmentation of the language increases its expressive
strength, without adding new non-logical symbols, such as new
predicate symbols.
 
For classical extensional logic (as in this entry), properties can be identified
with sets, so that second-order logic provides us with the quantifier
“for every set of objects.”



There are two approaches to the semantics of second-order logic.
  They differ on the interpretation of the phrase “for
every set of objects.”   Does this have some fixed meaning
to which we can refer, or do we need to consider the variety of
meanings the phrase might have?   In the first case (which will
be called standard semantics), we are taking for granted certain
mathematical concepts.    In the second case (which will be
called general semantics), much less is being taken for
granted.   In this case, to be considered valid, a
sentence will need to be true under all the allowable meanings of the
phrase “for every set of objects.”

in natural language, as a language for encoding temporal knowledge in
artificial intelligence, and as a tool for specification, formal
analysis, and verification of the executions of computer programs and

Modern Origins of Modal Logic,0.8483915925025941,0.7827303409576416,"

Modal logic can be viewed broadly as the logic of different sorts of
modalities, or modes of truth: alethic (“necessarily”),
epistemic (“it is known that”), deontic (“it ought
to be the case that”), or temporal (“it has been the case
that”) among others. Common logical features of these operators
justify the common label. In the strict sense however, the term
“modal logic” is reserved for the logic of the alethic
modalities, as opposed for example to temporal or deontic logic. From
a merely technical point of view, any logic with non-truth-functional
operators, including first-order logic, can be regarded as a modal
logic: in this perspective the quantifiers too can be regarded as
modal operators (as in Montague 1960). Nonetheless, we follow the
traditional understanding of modal logics as not including
full-fledged first-order logic. In this perspective it is the modal
operators that can be regarded as restricted quantifiers, ranging over
special entities like possible worlds or temporal instants. Arthur
Prior was one of the first philosophers/logicians to emphasize that
the modal system S5 can be translated into a fragment
of first-order logic, which he called “the uniform monadic
first-order predicate calculus” (Prior and Fine 1977: 56).
Monadic, since no relations between worlds needs to be stated for
S5; and uniform as only one variable is needed to
quantify over worlds (instants) when bound, and to refer to the
privileged state (the actual world or the present time) when free (see
Prior and Fine 1977). Concerning the technical question of which
model-theoretic features characterize modal logics understood as
well-behaved fragments of first-order logic, see Blackburn and van
Benthem’s “Modal Logic: A Semantic Perspective”
(2007a).

The scope of this entry is the recent historical development of modal
logic, strictly understood as the logic of necessity and possibility,
and particularly the historical development of systems of modal logic,
both syntactically and semantically, from C.I. Lewis’s
pioneering work starting in 1912, with the first systems devised in
1918, to S. Kripke’s work in the early 1960s. In that short span
of time of less than fifty years, modal logic flourished both
philosophically and mathematically. Mathematically, different modal
systems were developed and advances in algebra helped to foster the
model theory for such systems. This culminated in the development of a
formal semantics that extended to modal logic the successful
first-order model theoretic techniques, thereby affording completeness
and decidability results for many, but not all, systems.
Philosophically, the availability of different systems and the
adoption of the possible worlds model-theoretic semantics were
naturally accompanied by reflections on the nature of possibility and
necessity, on distinct sorts of necessities, on the role of the formal
semantics, and on the nature of the possible worlds, to mention just a
few. In particular, the availability of different systems brings to
the fore the philosophical question of which modal logic is the
correct one, under some intended interpretation of the modal
operators, e.g., as logical or metaphysical necessity. Questions
concerning the interpretability of modal logic, especially quantified
modal logic, were insistently raised by Quine. All such questions are
not pursued in this entry which is mostly devoted to the formal
development of the subject.

Modal logic is a rich and complex subject matter. This entry does not
present a complete survey of all the systems developed and of all the
model theoretic results proved in the lapse of time under
consideration. It does however offer a meaningful survey of the main
systems and aims to be useful to those looking for an historical
outline of the subject matter that, even if not all-inclusive,
delineates the most interesting model theoretic results and indicates
further lines of exploration. Bull and Segerberg’s (1984: 3)
useful division of the original sources of modal logic into three
distinct traditions—syntactic, algebraic, and model
theoretic—is adopted. For other less influential traditions, see
Bull and Segerberg (1984: 16). See also Lindström and
Segerberg’s “Modal Logic and Philosophy” (2007). The
main focus of this entry is on propositional modal logic, while only
some particular aspects of the semantics of quantified modal logic are
discussed. For a more detailed treatment of quantified modal logic,
consult the SEP entry on
 modal logic.
 Concerning the entry’s notation, notice that \(\Rightarrow\) is
adopted in place of Lewis’s fishhook for strict implication, and
\(\Leftrightarrow\) for strict equivalence.

The Early Development of Set Theory,0.9152429103851318,0.737158477306366,"

Set theory is one of the greatest achievements of modern mathematics.
Basically all mathematical concepts, methods, and results admit of
representation within axiomatic set theory. Thus set theory has served
quite a unique role by systematizing modern mathematics, and
approaching in a unified form all basic questions about admissible
mathematical arguments—including the thorny question of
existence principles. This entry covers in outline the convoluted
process by which set theory came into being, covering roughly the
years 1850 to 1930.

In 1910, Hilbert wrote that set theory is 


that mathematical discipline which today occupies an outstanding role
in our science, and radiates [ausströmt] its powerful
influence into all branches of mathematics. [Hilbert 1910, 466; my
translation] 


This already suggests that, in order to discuss the early history, it
is necessary to distinguish two aspects of set theory: its role as a
fundamental language and repository of the basic principles of modern
mathematics; and its role as an independent branch of mathematics,
classified (today) as a branch of mathematical logic. Both aspects are
considered here. 

The first section examines the origins and emergence of set
theoretic mathematics around 1870; this is followed by a discussion of
the period of expansion and consolidation of the theory up to
1900. Section 3 provides a look at the critical period in the
decade 1897 to 1908, and Section 4 deals with the time from Zermelo to
Gödel (from theory to metatheory), with special attention to the
often overlooked, but crucial, descriptive set theory.

The Normative Status of Logic,0.823771059513092,0.7066622376441956,"

We consider it to be a bad thing to be inconsistent. Similarly, we
criticize others for failing to appreciate (at least the more obvious)
logical consequences of their beliefs. In both cases there is a
failure to conform one’s attitudes to logical strictures. We
generally take agents who fall short of the demands of logic to be
rationally defective. This suggests that logic has a normative role to
play in our rational economy; it instructs us how we ought or ought
not to think or reason. The notion that logic has such a normative role
to play is deeply anchored in the way we traditionally think about
and teach logic. To consider just two
examples, Kant characterizes what he calls “pure general”
logic as embodying the “absolutely necessary rules of thought
without which there can be no employment whatsoever of the
understanding” (A52/B76), which instruct us not “how the
understanding is and thinks” but “how it ought to
proceed” (Kant 1974 [1800]: 16). Similarly, Frege, in his vehement opposition to the psychologistic tendencies
of his time, classifies logic, “like ethics” as a
“normative science” (Frege 1897/1979: 228), one
whose laws “prescribe universally how one should think if one is
to think at all” (Frege 1893/1903/2009: xv). This
entry is concerned with the question as to whether the tradition and
the intuitions that appear to underwrite it are correct. In other
words, it is concerned with the question as to whether logic has
normative authority over us? And if so, in what sense exactly it can be said to do so?

Russell's Logical Atomism,0.8590064048767091,0.6932721138000488,"


Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) described his philosophy as a kind of
“logical atomism”, by which he meant to endorse both a metaphysical
view and a certain methodology for doing philosophy. The metaphysical
view amounts to the claim that the world consists of a plurality of
independently existing things exhibiting qualities and standing in
relations. According to logical atomism, all truths are ultimately
dependent upon a layer of atomic facts, which consist either of a
simple particular exhibiting a quality, or multiple simple particulars
standing in a relation. The methodological view recommends a process of
analysis, whereby one attempts to define or reconstruct more complex
notions or vocabularies in terms of simpler ones. According to Russell,
at least early on during his logical atomist phase, such an analysis
could eventually result in a language containing only words
representing simple particulars, the simple properties and relations
thereof, and logical constants, which, despite this limited vocabulary,
could adequately capture all truths. 

 Russell's logical atomism had a profound influence on analytic
philosophy in the first half of the 20th century; indeed, it is
arguable that the very name “analytic philosophy” derives from
Russell's defense of the method of analysis.

Wittgenstein's Logical Atomism,0.8640246391296387,0.654997706413269,"

Although it has few adherents today, logical atomism was once a
leading movement of early twentieth-century analytic philosophy.
Different, though related, versions of the view were developed by
Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Russell’s logical
atomism is set forth chiefly in his 1918 work “The Philosophy of
Logical Atomism” (Russell 1956), Wittgenstein’s in his
Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus of 1921 (Wittgenstein 1981).
The core tenets of Wittgenstein’s logical atomism may be stated
as follows: (i) Every proposition has a unique final analysis which
reveals it to be a truth-function of elementary propositions
(Tractatus 3.25, 4.221, 4.51, 5); (ii) These elementary
propositions assert the existence of atomic states of affairs (3.25,
4.21); (iii) Elementary propositions are mutually independent —
each one can be true or false independently of the truth or falsity of
the others (4.211, 5.134); (iv) Elementary propositions are immediate
combinations of semantically simple symbols or “names”
(4.221); (v) Names refer to items wholly devoid of complexity,
so-called “objects” (2.02 & 3.22); (vi) Atomic states
of affairs are combinations of these objects (2.01).

Although these doctrines are recognizably atomist in spirit, the term
‘logical atomism’ is not used by Wittgenstein. It was
introduced by Russell in his 1911 lecture to the French Philosophical
Society, Le Réalisme Analytique (Russell
 1911).[1]
 Russell had advertised “The Philosophy of Logical
Atomism” as being “very largely concerned with explaining
certain ideas which [he had] learnt from [his] friend and former pupil
Ludwig Wittgenstein” (Marsh, 177). No doubt partly as a result
of this description, the term ‘logical atomism’
subsequently became associated with Wittgenstein’s early
philosophy. The term is now standardly used to apply to a vaguely
defined set of doctrines centered on theses (i)–(vi). In
Russell’s opinion, what makes it appropriate to speak of
logical atomism is that the atoms in question are to be
arrived at by logical rather than physical analysis (Russell 1956,
179). For Wittgenstein too, the ultimate constituents of reality are
to be revealed by a process of logical analysis; so, to that extent,
the label seems apt. It is not, however, uncontroversial (see Floyd
1998 and
 2007).[2]

Logical Constants,0.8383005857467651,0.6958937048912048,"


Logic is usually thought to concern itself only with features that
sentences and arguments possess in virtue of their logical structures
or forms. The logical form of a sentence or argument is
determined by its syntactic or semantic structure and by the placement
of certain expressions called “logical constants.”[1]
 Thus, for example, the
sentences
Every boy loves some girl.


and
Some boy loves every girl.


are thought to differ in logical form, even though they share a
common syntactic and semantic structure, because they differ in the
placement of the logical constants “every” and “some”. By contrast, the
sentences
Every girl loves some boy.


and
Every boy loves some girl.


are thought to have the same logical form, because “girl” and “boy”
are not logical constants. Thus, in order to settle questions about
logical form, and ultimately about which arguments are logically valid
and which sentences logically true, we must distinguish the “logical
constants” of a language from its nonlogical expressions.


While it is generally agreed that signs for negation, conjunction,
disjunction, conditionality, and the first-order quantifiers should
count as logical constants, and that words like “red”, “boy”, “taller”,
and “Clinton” should not, there is a vast disputed middle ground. Is
the sign for identity a logical constant? Are tense and modal operators
logical constants? What about “true”, the epsilon of set-theoretic
membership, the sign for mereological parthood, the second-order
quantifiers, or the quantifier “there are infinitely many”? Is there a
distinctive logic of agency, or of knowledge? In these border areas our
intuitions from paradigm cases fail us; we need something more
principled.


However, there is little philosophical consensus about the basis for
the distinction between logical and nonlogical expressions. Until this
question is resolved, we lack a proper understanding of the scope and
nature of logic, and of the significance of the distinction between the
“formal” properties and relations logic studies and related but
non-formal ones. For example, the sentence
If Socrates is human and mortal, then he is
mortal.


is generally taken to be a logical truth, while the sentence
If Socrates is orange, then he is colored.


is not, even though intuitively both are true, necessary, knowable
a priori, and analytic. What is the significance of the
distinction we are making between them in calling one but not the other
“logically true”? A principled demarcation of logical constants might
offer an answer to this question, thereby clarifying what is at stake
in philosophical controversies for which it matters what counts as
logic (for example, logicism and structuralism in the philosophy of
mathematics).


This article will discuss the problem of logical constants and
survey the main approaches to solving or resolving it.

Logical Constructions,0.8612221479415894,0.6979385018348694,"


The term “logical construction” was used by Bertrand
Russell to describe a series of similar philosophical theories
beginning with the 1901 “Frege-Russell” definition of
numbers as classes and continuing through his
“construction” of the notions of space, time and matter
after 1914. Philosophers since the 1920s have argued about the
significance of “logical construction” as a method in
analytic philosophy and proposed various ways of interpreting
Russell's notion. Some were inspired to develop their own projects by
examples of constructions. Russell's notion of logical construction
influenced both Carnap's project of constructing the physical world
from experience and Quine's notion of explication, and was a
model for the use of set theoretic reconstructions in formal
philosophy later in the twentieth century.


It was only when looking back on his work, in the programmatic 1924
essay “Logical Atomism”, that Russell first described
various logical definitions and philosophical analyses as
“logical constructions”. He listed as examples the
Frege-Russell definition of numbers as classes, the theory of definite
descriptions, the construction of matter from sense data and then
series, ordinal numbers and real numbers. Because of the particular
nature of Russell's use of “contextual” definitions
of expressions for classes, and the distinctive character of the theory
of definite descriptions, he regularly called the expressions for such
entities “incomplete symbols” and the entities themselves
“logical fictions”.


Logical constructions differ in whether they involve
explicit definitions or contextual definitions, and in the extent to which their result should be described as showing that the constructed object is a mere “fiction”.  Russell's 1901
definition of numbers as classes of equinumerous classes is
straightforwardly a case of constructing one
sort of entity as a class of others with an explicit definition. This was followed by the theory
of definite descriptions in 1905 and the “no-classes”
theory for defining classes in Principia Mathematica in 1910, both of which involved the distinctive technique of
contextual definition. In a contextual definition apparent singular
terms (either definite descriptions or class terms) are eliminated
through rules for defining the entire sentences in which they occur. Constructions which are like those using contextual definitions are generally called
“incomplete symbols”, while those like the theory of classes are called “fictions.” Russell
included the construction of matter, space and time as classes of sense data at
the end of his 1924 list. The main problem for interpreting the
notion of logical construction is to understand what these various examples have in common, and how the construction
of matter is comparable to either of the early constructions of
numbers as classes or the theory of definite descriptions and
“no-classes” theory of classes. None of the expressions
“fiction”,
“incomplete symbol” or even  “constructed from” seems appropriate for an analysis of the
fundamental features of the familiar physical world and the material
objects that occupy it.

Some inferences are impeccable. Examples like (1–3)
illustrate reasoning that cannot lead from true premises to false
conclusions. 




(1)
John danced if Mary sang, and Mary sang; so
John
danced.


(2)
Every politician is deceitful, and every
senator is a
politician; so every senator is deceitful.


(3)
The detective is in the garden; so someone is
in the
garden.




In such cases, a thinker takes no epistemic risk by endorsing the
conditional claim that the conclusion is true if the
premises are true.  The conclusion follows from the premises, without
any further assumptions that might turn out to be false. Any risk of
error lies entirely with the premises, as opposed to the reasoning. By
contrast, examples like (4–6) illustrate reasoning that involves
at least some risk of going wrong—from correct premises to a
mistaken conclusion.




(4)
John danced if Mary sang, and John danced; so
Mary
sang.


(5)
Every feathered biped is a bird, and Tweety is
a
feathered biped; so Tweety can fly.


(6)
Every human born before 1879 died; so every
human will
die.




 Inference (4) is not secure. John might dance whenever Mary sings,
but also sometimes when Mary doesn't sing. Similarly, with regard to
(5), Tweety might turn out to be a bird that cannot fly. Even (6)
falls short of the demonstrative character exhibited by (1–3).
While laws of nature may preclude immortality, the conclusion of (6)
goes beyond its premise, even if it is foolish to resist the
inference.

Appeals to logical form arose in the context of attempts to say more
about this intuitive distinction between impeccable inferences, which
invite metaphors of security, and inferences that involve some risk of
slipping from truth to falsity. The idea is that some inferences, like
(1-3), are structured in a way that confines any risk of
error to the premises. The motivations for developing this idea were
both practical and theoretical. Experience teaches us that an
inference can initially seem more secure than it is; and if we knew
which forms of inference are risk-free, that might help us
avoid errors. As we'll see, claims about inference are also intimately
connected with claims about the nature of thought and its relation to
language.

Many philosophers have been especially interested in the
possibility that grammar masks the underlying structure of
thought, perhaps in ways that invite mistaken views about how ordinary
language is related to cognition and the world we talk about.  For
example, similarities across sentences like ‘Odysseus
arrived’, ‘Nobody arrived’, and ‘The king
arrived’ initially suggest that the corresponding thoughts
exhibit a common subject-predicate form. But even if
‘Odysseus’ indicates an entity that can be the subject of
a thought that is true if and only if the entity in question arrived,
other considerations suggest that ‘Nobody’ and ‘The
king’ do not indicate subjects of thoughts in this sense. This
raises further questions about inference—e.g., why ‘The
king arrived’ implies an arrival, while ‘Nobody
arrived’ does not—and more general questions about how
logic is related to grammar. Do thoughts and sentences exhibit
different kinds of structure? Do sentences exhibit grammatical
structures that are not obvious? And if the logical structure of a
thought can diverge from the grammatical structure of a sentence that
is used to express the thought, how should we construe proposals about
the logical forms of inferences like (1-6)? Are such proposals
normative claims about how we ought to think/talk, or empirical
hypotheses about aspects of psychological/linguistic reality?
Proposed answers to these questions are usually interwoven with
claims about why various inferences seem compelling. So it would be
nice to know which inferences really are secure, and in virtue of what
these inferences are special.  The most common suggestion has
been that certain inferences are secure by virtue of their logical
form. Though unsurprisingly, conceptions of form have evolved along
with conceptions of logic and language.

Logical Pluralism,0.8290739059448242,0.6984713077545166,"
Logical pluralism is the thesis that there is more than one correct
logic. The main opposing view, logical monism, is the thesis that
there is only one. In fact there are many pairs of such opposed
theses—and so, many different versions of the thesis of logical
pluralism—corresponding to the different ways in which one can
specify more carefully what a logic is, and what it would be
for one to be correct. Some of these further specifications
result in versions of logical pluralism that seem relatively anodyne:
if any formal system can correctly be called a ‘logic’,
and to call one ‘correct’ is to say that it has a use,
then it seems clear that there can be more than one correct logic
given that, say, linear logic has computing applications, and
intuitionistic logic is useful in constructive mathematics. In
practice, philosophical attention has been focused on pluralisms that
employ stricter interpretations of ‘logic’ and
‘correct’. If a correct logic is a complete and accurate
specification of the relation of logical consequence on a set of
truth-bearers, and in order to count as numerically different logics
must disagree about whether that relation holds between the premises
and conclusion of some argument, then the thesis that there could be
more than one correct one will be of considerable interest to
philosophers of logic, and, indeed, to anyone interested in
consequence and argument more generally. 
 Logic has close historical links to the study of reasoning and so
the idea of logical pluralism can quickly bring to mind the idea that
different logics might be correct for different groups of people to
use in reasoning, that there might be, for example, different logics
for different cultural and biological groups—an African logic, a
female logic, a middle-class logic etc. But contemporary logical
pluralism has its origins in mathematical and formalist treatments of
consequence, especially the development of the so-called
‘deviant’ formal systems (see, e.g., Haack 1996; Priest
2008a; Burgess 2012), such as intuituionist, paraconsistent, and
quantum logics in the 20th Century which many authors in this area
compare to the development of alternative geometries during the 19th
(Haack 1996, 27–28; Beall & Restall 2000, 489; Priest 2006,
195–196). The existence of alternative logics raises the question of
which of the systems is correct, but historical discussions have
usually presupposed that if one of the logics is correct, then that it
is correct for all and 
everyone.[1]
The longevity of the controversy eventually led to the questioning of
one the presuppositions of the debate, namely, the assumption that
there really was a single correct logic. 
Recent interest in logical pluralism was sparked by a series of
papers by JC Beall and Greg Restall (Beall & Restall 2000, 2001;
Restall 2002), which culminated in the book (Beall & Restall
2006). Their work has generated a substantial literature (Goddu 2002;
Wyatt 2004; Allo 2007; van Benthem 2008; Lynch 2008; Russell
2008) and in particular Graham Priest has argued against their view
and in favour of logical monism (Priest 2006; 2008b). Interest in
this contemporary debate has led to a re-examination of some older
views, especially the pluralism resulting from Carnap's famous
tolerance for different linguistic frameworks and the work of
Scottish/French logician Hugh McColl (1837–1909), who some have
claimed was an early logical pluralist (Rahman, 2008). The recent
upsurge of interest has also resulted in the proposal of several
additional arguments for thinking there might be more than one correct
logic, many of which result in pluralisms which look rather different
from that of Beall & Restall.

Logical Truth,0.8364386558532715,0.6946866512298584,"


On any view, logic has as one of its goals to characterize (and give
us practical means to tell apart) a peculiar set of truths, the
logical truths, of which the following English sentences are
paradigmatic examples:

(1)

If death is bad only if life is good, and death is bad, then
life is good.

(2)

If no desire is voluntary and some beliefs are desires, then
some beliefs are not voluntary.
(3)

If Drasha is a cat and all cats are mysterious, then Drasha is
mysterious.



As it turns out, it is very hard to think of universally accepted
ideas about what the generic properties of logical truths are or
should be. A widespread, perhaps universally accepted idea is that
part of what distinguishes logical truths from other kinds of truths
is that logical truths have a yet to be fully understood modal
force. It is typical to hold that, in some sense or senses of
“could”, a logical truth could not be false or,
alternatively, that in some sense or senses of “must”, a
logical truth must be true. But there is little if any agreement about
how the relevant modality should be understood.


Another widespread idea is that part of what distinguishes logical
truths is that they are in some sense yet to be fully understood
“formal”. That a logical truth is formal implies at the
very least that all the sentences which are appropriate replacement
instances of its logical form are logical truths too. In this context,
the logical form of a sentence \(S\) is supposed to be a certain
schema determined uniquely by \(S\), a schema of which \(S\)
is a replacement instance, and of which sentences with the same form
as \(S\) are replacement instances too. A form has at the very
least the property that the expressions in it which are not schematic
letters (the “logical expressions”) are widely applicable
across different areas of discourse. Among people who accept the idea
of formality there would be wide agreement that the forms of (1), (2)
and (3) would be something like \((1')\), \((2')\) and \((3')\)
respectively:

\((1')\)

\(a\) is \(P\) only if \(b\) is \(Q\), and \(a\) is \(P\), then \(b\) is \(Q\).

\((2')\)

If no \(Q\) is \(R\) and some \(P\)s are \(Q\)s, then some \(P\)s are not \(R\).

\((3')\)

If \(a\) is a \(P\) and all \(P\)s are \(Q\), then \(a\) is \(Q\).




\((1')\), \((2')\) and \((3')\) do seem to give rise to logical
truths for all appropriate replacements of the letters
“\(a\)”, “\(b\)”,
“\(P\)”, “\(Q\)”, and
“\(R\)”. And expressions such as “if”,
“and”, “some”, “all”, etc., which
are paradigmatic logical expressions, do seem to be widely applicable
across different areas of discourse. But the idea that logical truths
are or should be formal is certainly not universally accepted. And
even among those who accept it, there is little if any agreement about
what generic criteria determine the form of an arbitrary
sentence.[1]


A remarkable fact about logical truth is that many have thought it
plausible that the set of logical truths of certain rich formalized
languages is characterizable in terms of concepts of standard
mathematics. In particular, on some views the set of logical truths of
a language of that kind is always the set of sentences of the language
derivable in a certain calculus. On other, more widespread views, the
set of logical truths of a language of that kind can be identified with
the set of sentences that are valid across a certain range of
mathematical interpretations (where validity is something related to
but different from the condition that all the sentences that are
replacement instances of its form be true too; see below, section 2.3).
One main achievement of early mathematical logic was precisely to show
how to characterize notions of derivability and validity in terms of
concepts of standard mathematics. (Sections 2.2 and 2.3 give a basic
description of the mathematically characterized notions of derivability
and validity, with references to other entries.)


In part 1 of this entry we will describe in very broad outline the
main existing views about how to understand the ideas of modality and
formality relevant to logical truth. (A more detailed treatment of
these views is available in other entries mentioned below, and
especially in the entries on the
 analytic/synthetic distinction and
 logical constants.) In part 2 we
 will describe, also in outline, a particular set of philosophical
issues that arise when one considers the attempted mathematical
characterizations of logical truth. The question of whether or in what
sense these characterizations are correct is bound with the question
of what is or should be our specific understanding of the ideas of
modality and
 formality.[2]

Logicism and Neologicism,0.8813133835792542,0.7037730813026428,"

Logicism is a philosophical, foundational, and
foundationalist doctrine that can be advanced with respect to
any branch of mathematics. Traditionally, logicism has concerned
itself especially with arithmetic and real analysis. It comes in a
stronger and a weaker version. 

The strong version of logicism maintains that all
mathematical truths in the chosen branch(es) form a species
of logical truth. The weak version of logicism, by contrast, maintains
only that all the theorems do. (By ‘theorems’ we
mean results that are provable within the branch of
mathematics in question.) The foundationalism is with respect to those
parts of mathematics that the logicist reconstructs. Success in this
regard is compatible, however, with a non-foundationalist (e.g.,
coherentist) view of the parts of mathematics that cannot be so
reconstructed. 

Both versions of logicism—strong and weak—maintain that


All the objects forming the subject matter of those
branches of mathematics are logical objects; and 
Logic—in some suitably general and powerful sense that the
logicist will have to define—is capable of furnishing
definitions of the primitive concepts of these branches of
mathematics, allowing one to derive the mathematician’s
‘first principles’ therein as results within Logic itself.
(The branch of mathematics in question is thereby said to have been
reduced to Logic.)


For the foundationalist who accepts Kant’s distinction between
analytic and synthetic truth, the truths of logic are paradigm cases
of analytic truths. They are true solely by virtue of the meanings
of the linguistic expressions involved in expressing them; or, as
Kant might have preferred it, by virtue of internal relations among
the concepts involved. A successful logicist reduction of any branch
of mathematics will therefore show that its truths (strong version) or
its theorems (weak version) are analytic. 

Another consequence of successful logicist reduction of a given branch
of mathematics is that mathematical certainty (within that branch) is
of a piece with certainty about logical truth. The same holds for
necessity; and for the a priori character of the knowledge
concerned. 

Logicist doctrines were espoused in two main forms—Fregean and
Russellian—until around 1930, at which point logicism went into
decline, largely because of the discovery of Gödelian
incompleteness, and the ascendancy of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory,
which displaced the Russellian theory of types as the most promising
foundational theory for mathematics. The doctrine of
neo-logicism subsequently revived some of the core ideas of
logicism, with its first hints appearing in the mid-1960s, and its
more substantive contributions beginning in the 1980s. 

The main technical and philosophical innovation of the
neo-logicists is their use of abstraction principles
in order to secure the existence of such things as numbers,
understood, with Frege, as logical objects. One favored kind
of abstraction principle typically effects the reification of
equivalence classes of an equivalence
 relation.[1]
 One of Frege’s favorite examples involved the equivalence
relation of parallelism among lines. The relevant abstraction would be
that of the direction of a line. Thus, two lines
l1 and l2 have the same
direction just in case they are parallel: 

d(l1) = d(l2) ⇔
l1 || l2.


The function denoted by the abstraction operator d( ) is
here applied to lines, and produces directions (new abstract
objects) as its values. Note that the abstraction operator can take
variables as arguments. 

The neo-logicists characterize abstraction operators that produce
numbers as their values. Details of notation and method will
be provided in due course. 

There has not been any historical trend discernible as an
evolution of the doctrine of logicism, with incremental
adjustments to deal with occasional problems as they arose, while
maintaining a reasonably stable trajectory towards an ideal
formulation. Rather, the doctrine has been characterized by abrupt
shifts as far as methods and materials are concerned, even if the goal
has remained relatively constant through such
 changes.[2]
 We shall allow the pattern of change to become evident as the
different phases of logicism are recounted below.

Rudolph Hermann Lotze (1817–1881) mediated the
transition from the exuberance of German idealism, in the first half
of the nineteenth century, to the sober, scholarly and scientific
ethos that came to prevail in the second half. He adapted the notion
of “chief” or defining problems in the philosophical
sub-disciplines, inherited from Herbart, and brought opposing
approaches to bear on them, in a quasi-systematic way, preparing the
way for the modern textbook. A professor in a changing situation,
moving toward bureaucratic centralization in an encompassing national
state, he mostly restricted his attention to academic issues,
appealing to his peers (but not the public) in the now rising
professional journal (while maintaining a lively interest in things
quotidian). Given the increasing amounts of data and the rising
importance of the burgeoning new disciplines, Lotze hoped to preserve
a special place for philosophy as a value-theoretic
investigation. Lotze's influence was far-reaching and not yet widely
admitted or well understood. While he accidentally inspired numerous
materialists (and was simultaneously claimed by the idealists), his
strong association with certain traditionalist preachers, on the one
hand, and liberal theological movements, on the other, blunted his
interest for the philosophical revolutionaries of the twentieth
century, while simultaneously preserving a continued line of

Moral luck occurs when an agent can be correctly treated as an object
of moral judgment despite the fact that a significant aspect of what
she is assessed for depends on factors beyond her control. Bernard
Williams writes, “when I first introduced the expression
moral luck, I expected to suggest an oxymoron”
(Williams 1993, 251). Indeed, immunity from luck has been thought by
many to be part of the very essence of morality. And yet, as Williams
(1981) and Thomas Nagel (1979) showed in their now classic pair of
articles, it appears that our everyday judgments and practices commit
us to the existence of moral luck. The problem of moral luck arises
because we seem to be committed to the general principle that we are
morally assessable only to the extent that what we are assessed for
depends on factors under our control (call this the “Control
Principle”). At the same time, when it comes to countless
particular cases, we morally assess agents for things that depend on
factors that are not in their control. And making the situation still
more problematic is the fact that a very natural line of reasoning
suggests that it is impossible to morally assess anyone for
anything if we adhere to the Control Principle.

pre-World War II writings in literary theory, aesthetic theory and
Marxist philosophy. Today, his most widely read works are the
Theory of the Novel of 1916 and History and Class
Consciousness of 1923. In History and Class
Consciousness, Lukács laid out a wide-ranging critique of
the phenomenon of “reification” in capitalism and
formulated a vision of Marxism as a self-conscious transformation of
society. This text became an important reference point both for
critical social theory and for many currents of countercultural
thought. Even though his later work could not capture the imagination
of the intellectual public as much as his earlier writings,
Lukács remained a prolific writer and an influential theorist in
his later career and published hundreds of articles on literary theory
and aesthetics, not to mention numerous books, including two massive
works on aesthetics and ontology. He was also active as a politician
in Hungary in both the revolution of 1919 and during the events of

because it contains the promise of a reformulation of an undogmatic,
non-reductionist Marxism, but also because it connects a philosophical

their liberties against the absolutist tendencies of the Stuarts,
affirmed the right of the people to depose their monarch. She wrote a
further history, in letters, covering the period after 1688, as well
as political pamphlets, refuting the monarchism of Hobbes, and the
political conservatism of Burke. She criticized the policy of the
British Government in the lead up to the American War of Independence,
and was welcomed by the Americans, after Independence, as an important
advocate of the principles on which the United States was founded. In
her pamphlets she defended the right to petition and argued for
copyright. Her most philosophical work, A Treatise on the
Immutability of Moral Truth (1783), developed the doctrine of the
will that she called “moral necessity”; this work was
partly reproduced in her Letters on Education (1790), which
was, in turn, reviewed by, and profoundly influenced, Mary
Wollstonecraft.

Ernst Mach,0.8731037378311157,0.3966838419437408,"

The frequent excursions which I have made into this province have
all sprung from the profound conviction that the foundations of science
as a whole, and of physics in particular, await their next greatest
elucidations from the side of biology, and especially, from the
analysis of the sensations. [Mach in Analysis of Sensations:
Preface to 1st Ed.]


Ernst Mach (February 18, 1838 – February 19, 1916) made major
contributions to physics, philosophy, and physiological
psychology. In physics, the speed of sound bears his name, as he was
the first to systematically study super-sonic motion. He also made
important contributions to understanding the Doppler effect. His
critique of Newtonian ideas of absolute space and time were an
inspiration to the young Einstein, who credited Mach as being the
philosophical forerunner of relativity theory. His systematic
skepticism of the old physics was similarly important to a generation
of young German physicists.


In philosophy, he is best known for his influence upon the Vienna
Circle (a predecessor of which was named the Ernst Mach Verein), for
his famous anti-metaphysical attitude (which developed into the
verifiability theory of meaning), for his anti-realist stance in
opposition to atomism, and in general for his positivist-empiricist
approach to epistemology. It is important to note that some of these
influences are currently being re-examined, and are now thought to be
both more tenuous and more complicated than was once assumed. He was
also an important historian of science, and occupied the Chair for the
Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences at the University of
Vienna. Although previous philosophers had commented on science and
many scientists had influenced philosophy, Mach more than anyone else
bridged the divide; he is a founder of the philosophy of science.


In psychology, he studied the relationship of our sensations to
external stimuli. Space, time, color, sound, once the domain of
physics, were now also being studied by psychologists and conceived of
as not only the stuff of the physical external world but also the
elements of our inner experience. Mach was deeply inspired by
Gustav Fechner's psychophysics here. Psychologists today
regard him as a founder of Gestalt theory as well as the discoverer of
neural inhibition. Importantly, although in the twentieth century
he was better known to philosophers for his influence upon physics and
the philosophy of physics, it was psychology that was the primary
driving force behind his philosophy of science.


In his later years (1901), Mach was appointed to the Austrian
Parliament, where he was known as a reformer. His intellectual
influence amongst leftists was so great that Lenin wrote a book,
Materialism and Empirico-Criticism, criticizing Machian
anti-materialism.

Niccolò Machiavelli,0.4183616340160369,0.6216055750846863,"


Why an entry on Machiavelli? That question might naturally and
legitimately occur to anyone encountering an entry about him in an
encyclopedia of philosophy. Certainly, Machiavelli contributed to a
large number of important discourses in Western
thought—political theory most notably, but also history and
historiography, Italian literature, the principles of warfare, and
diplomacy. But Machiavelli never seems to have considered himself a
philosopher—indeed, he often overtly rejected philosophical
inquiry as beside the point—nor do his credentials suggest that
he fits comfortably into standard models of academic philosophy. His
writings are maddeningly and notoriously unsystematic, inconsistent
and sometimes self-contradictory. He tends to appeal to experience and
example in the place of rigorous logical analysis. Yet succeeding
thinkers who more easily qualify as philosophers of the first rank did
(and do) feel compelled to engage with his ideas, either to dispute
them or to incorporate his insights into their own
teachings. Machiavelli may have grazed at the fringes of philosophy,
but the impact of his musings has been widespread and lasting. The
terms “Machiavellian” or “Machiavellism” find
regular purchase among philosophers concerned with a range of ethical,
political, and psychological phenomena, even if Machiavelli did not
invent “Machiavellism” and may not even have been a
“Machiavellian” in the sense often ascribed to him.
Moreover, in Machiavelli's critique of “grand”
philosophical schemes, we find a challenge to the enterprise of
philosophy that commands attention and demands consideration and
response. Thus, Machiavelli deserves a place at the table in any
comprehensive survey of philosophy.

Madhyamaka,0.4598494172096253,0.3342244625091553,"


The Madhyamaka school of Buddhism, the followers of which are called
Mādhyamikas, was one of the two principal schools of
Mahāyāna Buddhism in India, the other school being the
Yogācāra. The name of the school is a reference to the claim
made of Buddhism in general that it is a middle path (madhyamā
pratipad) that avoids the two extremes of eternalism—the
doctrine that all things exist because of an eternal essence—and
annihilationism—the doctrine that things have essences while they
exist but that these essences are annihilated just when the things
themselves go out of existence. The conviction of the Madhyamaka
school, which can be called the Centrist school in English, is that
this middle path is best achieved by a denial that things have any
inherent natures at all. All things are, in other words, empty of
inherent natures. This doctrine of universal emptiness of inherent
natures (svabhāva-śūnyatā) is the hallmark
of the school, which places the school solidly in the tradition
associated with the Perfection of Wisdom
(prajñāpāramitā) literature of
Mahāyāna Buddhism.


The key texts of the school comprised commentaries to the writings
of Nāgārjuna—the works of Nāgārjuna most
often commented upon are the
Mūla-madhyamaka-kārikā (MMK) and
Vigraha-vyāvartanī (VV)—and a number of
independent works that expanded on ideas found in Nāgārjuna's
writings. A few of the Sanskrit treatises of the early Madhyamaka
school were translated into Chinese and became the basis of a
short-lived school of Chinese Buddhism. A significant number of
Sanskrit Madhyamaka texts were eventually translated into Tibetan and
exerted considerable influence on the intellectual heritage of Tibetan
Buddhism. This article will deal only with the Madhyamaka school in
India from the fifth through the eighth centuries, during which time
the school underwent most of its evolution.

Salomon Maimon,0.6201239228248596,0.42861759662628174,"


Salomon Maimon (1753–1800) stands as one of the most acute,
original, and complicated thinkers — and certainly one of the
most fascinating personalities — of the 1780s and 1790s. By
granting the principle of sufficient reason unlimited validity Maimon
embraces a radical form of rationalism. His robust criteria for the
validity of knowledge suggests that even Kant's attempt to limit
epistemological claims to the realm of possible experience cannot be
secured without a substantial ontological commitment. Kant faces a
severe choice: either adopt elements from the dogmatic metaphysics he
set out to challenge, or accept that his system is undermined by
skepticism. In revealing what he sees as the skeptical implications of
rationalism, Maimon raises important objections to Kant's critical
idealism, as well as develops deep insights into the problems of
experience and givenness. His ‘skeptically rationalist’
claims about the nature and limits of human cognition present a
distinctive perspective on the Kantian project of transcendental
idealism, as well as on central epistemological issues concerning the
relation between thought and the world. The eminent German scholar,
Manfred Frank recently suggested that Maimon is the “last great
philosopher” about to be discovered.

Moses ben Maimon [known to English speaking audiences as Maimonides
and Hebrew speaking as Rambam] (1138–1204) is the greatest Jewish
philosopher of the medieval period and is still widely read today. The
Mishneh Torah, his 14-volume compendium of Jewish law,
established him as the leading rabbinic authority of his time and quite
possibly of all time. His philosophic masterpiece, the Guide of the
Perplexed, is a sustained treatment of Jewish thought and practice
that seeks to resolve the conflict between religious knowledge and
secular. Although heavily influenced by the Neo-Platonized
Aristotelianism that had taken root in Islamic circles, it departs from
prevailing modes of Aristotelian thought by emphasizing the limits of
human knowledge and the questionable foundations of significant parts
of astronomy and metaphysics. Maimonides also achieved fame as a
physician and wrote medical treatises on a number of diseases and their
cures. Succeeding generations of philosophers wrote extensive
commentaries on his works, which influenced thinkers as diverse as
Aquinas, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Newton.

The Influence of Islamic Thought on Maimonides,0.555069625377655,0.1614217907190323,"


A visionary thinker and prolific author, Moses Maimonides
(1135/8-1204) writes on topics ranging from physics to Jewish Law,
theology to politics, psychology to Biblical exegesis, and from
philosophy to medicine. Rich and complex in their own right,
Maimonides' writings must, however, be understood within their
12th-13th century Islamicate context, revealing, as they do, the
imprint of earlier Greek and Islamic philosophical traditions. In this
entry, we will uncover some of the Islamic philosophical and
theological underpinnings of Maimonides' work with a focus on
the Theology of Aristotle, and the writings of al-Farabi
(ca. 870-950), Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980-1037), al-Ghazali (1058-1111),
and Averroes (Ibn Rushd, 1126-1198).


A few preliminary caveats and reminders:


(a) It is not possible to cover every aspect of Maimonides' Islamic
philosophical heritage (even if we restrict ourselves to the
aforementioned text traditions) in a format of this sort; one might
certainly speak of other Islamic writers whose works arguably
influenced Maimonides. To best do justice to this topic, I will
proceed in what follows by selecting instructive and representative
bits of primary text from Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed
(henceforth, Guide), and comparing them with ideas from the
aforementioned texts. In this way, readers will be helped to see a
selection of continuities in philosophical tradition between five
important Islamic text traditions and Maimonides. By proceeding in
this way, I additionally hope to have supplied readers with
appropriate Arabic philosophical resource materials for further
study. It might be noted too that given my current goal of
facilitating as much active engagement on the part of as wide a range
of readers as possible, I have limited the cited Arabic texts in this
study to those that are currently available in English
translation.


(b) While I end with a selected bibliography of secondary readings,
readers ought to be aware in particular of Shlomo Pines' “Translator's
Introduction” to his English translation of the Guide, a well-known
and commonly cited essay in which he addresses the Greek and Islamic
sources at play in Maimonides'
 thought.[1]
 While a classic resource, Pines’ essay is
subject to scholarly debate (e.g. as we will see below, pace Pines,
more scholars are finding the direct influence of Averroes and
al-Ghazali in Maimonides’ Guide).


(c) Finally, it ought also be noted in way of introduction that
Maimonides' philosophy is, as we will see, deeply imbued with
Neoplatonic metaphysical notions such as “emanation” (or “overflow”)
and divine transcendence. While I will talk about these notions and
their occurrence in Maimonides and in his Islamic philosophical
context, and while I will try to give a basic sense of how these ideas
work, any attempt to fully explain these Plotinian metaphysical ideas
falls outside the scope of the current entry. In this respect, readers
are invited to consult primary and secondary sources on Plotinus and
Neoplatonic metaphysics in Greek, Jewish, and Islamic sources.

The French Cartesian Nicolas Malebranche was hailed by his
contemporary, Pierre Bayle, as “the premier philosopher of our
age.” Over the course of his philosophical career, Malebranche
published major works on metaphysics, theology, and ethics, as well as
studies of optics, the laws of motion and the nature of color. He is
known principally for offering a highly original synthesis of the views
of his intellectual heroes, St. Augustine and René Descartes.
Two distinctive results of this synthesis are Malebranche’s doctrine
that we see bodies through ideas in God and his occasionalist
conclusion that God is the only real cause.

Malebranche's Theory of Ideas and Vision in God,0.6334356069564819,0.3156847059726715,"


The seventeenth-century French philosopher Nicolas Malebranche
(1638–1715) famously argued that ‘we see all things in
God.’ This doctrine of ‘Vision in God’ is intended
as an account both of sense perception of material things and of the
purely intellectual cognition of mathematical objects and abstract
truths. The theological motivation for this doctrine is clear: Vision
in God places us in immediate contact with God in our everyday
experience of the world and in some of our most private thoughts and
musings. Like his other signature doctrine,
‘Occasionalism’ or the view that God is the only genuine
cause, Vision in God is also rooted in Malebranche’s conviction that
we utterly depend on God in every way.


Although Malebranche was widely revered by his contemporaries as one
of their leading lights — an equal to Descartes, Locke, and
Leibniz — the theological spirit of his philosophy tarnished his
reputation among Anglo-American philosophers in the last
century. Scholarship over the past thirty-five years, however, has
begun to restore his credentials as a philosopher of first rank by
unveiling the philosophical motivations for his doctrines, and by
stressing his ingenuity in solving problems bequeathed to him by his
two great philosophical forebears, Augustine and Descartes. Both of
these virtues are manifest in the doctrine of Vision in God.

The Austrian philosopher Ernst Mally (1879–1944) is one of the
most important representatives of Meinong’s School. Though he is best
known for his work on Meinong’s theory of objects (Gegenstandstheorie)
and for his development of deontic logic, he has also gained some
notoriety for his German-nationalist convictions and his support of
National Socialist ideology. On the one hand, Mally’s contribution to
Meinong’s theory of objects is not a mere extension of his teacher’s
work, but rather a real alternative that, in turn, influenced Meinong’s
own conceptions. Moreover, he was the first philosopher to establish a
formal system of deontic logic (see the entry on
 Mally’s deontic logic),
 and though, according to most philosophers, it was
seriously flawed, it was a major undertaking and only recently received
the attention it was due. On the other hand, some of Mally’s later
writings were particularly influenced by his sympathies for National
Socialism. In what follows, we will identify and outline the various
strands of his thought, and also address the delicate question of
whether and how his sympathies for National Socialism affected his

Consider this case: Tonya plans to do Y, but Irving wants her
to do X instead. Irving has tried unsuccessfully to provide
Tonya with reasons for doing X rather than Y. If Irving
is unwilling to resort to coercion or force, he might deploy any of
the following tactics to try to influence Tonya’s choice. For
example, Irving might …

 Charm Tonya into wanting to please Irving by doing
X.
 Exaggerate the advantages of doing X and the
disadvantages of doing Y, and/or understate the disadvantages
of doing X and the advantages of doing Y.
 Make Tonya feel guilty for preferring to do
Y.
 Induce Tonya into an emotional state that makes
doing X seem more appropriate than it really is.
 Point out that doing Y will make Tonya seem
less worthy and appealing to her friends.
 Make Tonya feel badly about herself and portray
Y as a choice that will confirm or exacerbate this feeling,
and/or portray X as a choice that will disconfirm or combat
it.
 Do a small favor for Tonya before asking her to do
X, so that she feels obligated to comply.
 Make Tonya doubt her own judgment so that she will
rely on Irving’s advice to do X.
 Make it clear to Tonya that if she does Y
rather than X, Irving will withdraw his friendship, sulk, or
become irritable and generally unpleasant.
 Focus Tonya’s attention on some aspect of
doing Y that Tonya fears and ramp up that fear to get her to
change her mind about doing Y.


Each of these tactics could reasonably be called a form of manipulation.
Many also have more specific, commonplace names, such as “guilt
trip” (tactic 3), “gaslighting” (tactic 8),
“peer pressure” (tactic 5), “negging” (tactic
6), and “emotional blackmail” (tactic 9). Perhaps not
everyone will agree that every tactic on this list is
properly described as manipulation. And in some cases, whether the
tactic seems manipulative may depend on various details not specified
in the case as described. For example, if Y is seriously
immoral, then perhaps it is not manipulative for Irving to induce
Tonya to feel guilty about planning to do Y. It is also
possible that we might revise our judgments about some of these
tactics in light of a fully worked out and well supported theory of
manipulation—if we had one. Nevertheless, this list should
provide a reasonably good sense of what we mean by
“manipulation” in the present context. It should also
serve to illustrate the wide variety of tactics commonly described as
manipulation.

Manipulation is often characterized as a form of influence that is
neither coercion nor rational persuasion. But this characterization
immediately raises the question: Is every form of influence
that is neither coercion nor rational persuasion a form of
manipulation? If manipulation does not occupy the entire logical space
of influences that are neither rational persuasion nor coercion, then
what distinguishes it from other forms of influence that are neither
coercion nor rational persuasion?

The term “manipulation” is commonly thought to include an
element of moral disapprobation: To say that Irving manipulated Tonya
is commonly taken to be a moral criticism of Irving’s behavior.
Is manipulation always immoral? Why is manipulation immoral
(when it is immoral)? If manipulation is not always immoral, then what
determines when it is immoral?

Lucrezia Marinella,0.5999894738197327,0.678011953830719,"

Lucrezia Marinella was a Venetian author of the sixteenth century, who
published prolifically in a range of genres, primarily devotional
literature (in prose and verse) and philosophical polemics. Her work,
La nobiltà et l’eccellenza delle donne, co’
difetti et mancamenti de gli uomini, (The Nobility and
Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men), published
in 1600, was one of the first polemical treatises written by a woman
in Italian as part of an ongoing debate about the nature and worth of
women, often called the querelle des femmes (the debate about
 women).[1]
The Nobility and Excellence of Women is an erudite
recapitulation of the arguments and evidence brought forward to
support claims for the merits of women, but it is more than a summary.
Marinella provides a cogent, extended argument for the superiority of
women’s intellectual and moral capacities, effectively
constructing an account of a nature proper to women and distinct from
the nature of man.

The Nobility and Excellence of Women is remarkable in several
respects, aside from its philosophical and rhetorical skill. First,
although several of Marinella’s predecessors on the pro-woman
side of the debate had argued both that men and women were equal in so
far as they shared a rational soul, and also that women were superior,
they had failed to address adequately the tension between the claims
of equality and of superiority; Marinella addresses it directly and
persuasively. Her argument takes the bodies of women as a starting
point, from which she adduces evidence to demonstrate that
women’s moral characters are better than those of men, and that
the moral superiority of women leads to an intellectual superiority.
Second, Marinella advances the case being made by women and their
supporters beyond a demand for sympathy and respect from men to a
demand for freedom, power, and equality (Cox 1995, 520). Although she
did not propose concrete reforms, she did analyze the situation of
women in explicitly political terms. Third, although many had decried
the viciousness of those who argued for the inferiority of women,
Marinella was one of the first to supply an explanation of the motives
of men who published misogynist works, and to connect those motives to
the exclusion of women from public life (Jordan 1990, 259; Cox 1995,
516).

Markets,0.4653424322605133,0.7583152651786804,"

Markets are institutions in which individuals or collective agents
exchange goods and services. They usually use money as a medium of
exchange, which leads to the formation of prices. Markets can be
distinguished according to the goods or services traded in them (e.g.,
financial markets, housing markets, labor markets), according to their
scope (e.g., regional, national, international markets), or according
to their structure (e.g., competitive markets, oligopolistic markets,
monopolistic markets). From a normative perspective, markets are of
interest for a number of reasons: various arguments for and against
markets relate to central questions of social and political
philosophy. In addition, markets depend on, and in turn influence,
many other institutions and aspects of social life. They thus
co-determine the ways in which values such as liberty, justice or
solidarity can be realized. Questions as to which markets, for what
goods, can be defended by normative arguments, and how they relate to
other institutions, are therefore at the core of thinking about a just
society.

Markets are analyzed in a variety of disciplines, including sociology,
history, and, most notably, economics. In philosophy, the interest in
questions relating to markets has seen ebbs and flows. Starting
roughly in the 18th century, one finds debates about a
society in which markets are a social sphere of their own, and have an
impact on the society as a whole. This article presents the most
important strands of the philosophical debate about markets. It offers
some distinctions between the concept of markets and related concepts,
as well as a brief outline of historical positions vis-à-vis
markets. The main focus is on presenting the most common arguments for
and against markets, and on analyzing the ways in which markets are
related to other social institutions. In the concluding section
questions about markets are connected to two related themes,
methodological questions in economics and the topics of business
ethics and corporate social responsibility.

Anton Marty (October 18, 1847-October 1, 1914) was a philosopher of
language, psychologist, and ontologist. He was born in Schwyz,
Switzerland in a very large family and baptized as a Catholic with the
full name of ‘Martin Anton Maurus Marty’. His oldest
brother went into the priesthood and became a missionary to the Sioux
in North America. Though Marty himself was ordained, he left the
priesthood shortly after Brentano had done so (in 1873, a few years
after the declaration of papal infallibility) and pursued an academic
career instead. He died in Prague, at that time a city that belonged
within the Austro-Hungarian Empire and where he had been professor at
the German-speaking division of the Ferdinand Charles University for
most of his academic career.


Marty's philosophical work is distinct especially as an
application of Brentano's descriptive psychology to the study of
language in opposition to many of the prominent currents in linguistics
and philosophy of language during his time. These were in many cases
much more historical rather than psychological in character, but also
often based on psychological theories wherein intentionality was not
fully or hardly at all thematized as it was in Brentanian psychology.
Marty's philosophy of language is accordingly outstanding as a
reflection on linguistic phenomena as essentially intentional.

Karl Marx,0.4436043202877045,0.8885242342948914,"


Karl Marx (1818–1883) is best known not as a philosopher but as
a revolutionary, whose works inspired the foundation of many communist
regimes in the twentieth century. It is hard to think of many who have
had as much influence in the creation of the modern world. Trained as
a philosopher, Marx turned away from philosophy in his mid-twenties,
towards economics and politics. However, in addition to his overtly
philosophical early work, his later writings have many points of
contact with contemporary philosophical debates, especially in the
philosophy of history and the social sciences, and in moral and
political philosophy. Historical materialism — Marx’s theory of
history — is centered around the idea that forms of society rise
and fall as they further and then impede the development of human
productive power. Marx sees the historical process as proceeding
through a necessary series of modes of production, characterized by
class struggle, culminating in communism. Marx’s economic analysis of
capitalism is based on his version of the labour theory of value, and
includes the analysis of capitalist profit as the extraction of
surplus value from the exploited proletariat. The analysis of history
and economics come together in Marx’s prediction of the inevitable
economic breakdown of capitalism, to be replaced by communism. However
Marx refused to speculate in detail about the nature of communism,
arguing that it would arise through historical processes, and was not
the realisation of a pre-determined moral ideal.

The Metaphysics of Mass Expressions,0.8491644263267517,0.33022356033325195,"
A man might lose an appendix and some blood in surgery, but it
seems wrong to say that there is a thing he lost in addition
to the appendix. After a child destroys her sandcastle, there is one
less thing in the world, but no less sand. One can count cakes, but
not cake. Split a large portion of water in half and you will be left
with what you started with—water. Split a computer monitor in
half and you will not be left with a monitor or monitors. 
These examples point to a ubiquitous but elusive conceptual
distinction between stuff and things. Paradigmatic
examples of stuffs are wood, water, hydrogen, and iron. Less
paradigmatic stuffs include beer, salsa, and butter. The most general
physical stuff-kind is matter. The concept of stuff is even
more general than matter. Concepts such as ectoplasm,
justification, or phlogiston may refer to spiritual or abstract
stuff. ‘Things’ or ‘objects’ refer, most
paradigmatically, to medium-sized entities such as tables and ladles,
pears and bears, and locks and socks. 
Philosophical explorations of the distinction have generated a
number of interesting questions in philosophy of language and
metaphysics. The linguistic distinction between what are
called mass expressions (e.g., ‘lead’, ‘the
water in the tub’) and count expressions (e.g.,
‘two horses,’ ‘the horse in the barn’) is
believed to be important in examining the metaphysical stuff/thing
distinction. In this entry we will be more concerned with nominal mass
expressions (e.g., ‘the water in the tub’, ‘the gold
in his teeth’), as opposed to predicative mass expressions
(e.g., ‘the statue is lead’). Some main questions in this
area include: Are things illusory, the world consisting, most
fundamentally, of stuff alone? Or is stuff just a certain kind of
thing or things? Is all talk of physical kinds of stuff only about
concrete portions of matter, or is it also (or instead) about
universals? Is there a stuff quantifier in addition to the standard
one?
The present essay articulates the foregoing questions, and surveys
various answers to them. In particular, we will survey different
answers to the following, which is our main target question: What do
nominal mass expressions refer to?

condition, the condition of being physical. Of course, physicalists
don't deny that the world might contain many items that at first
glance don't seem physical — items of a biological, or

treatment of style in history and philosophy of the natural sciences

Constructive Mathematics,0.9138538837432858,0.7980207204818726,"


Constructive mathematics is distinguished from its traditional
counterpart, classical mathematics, by the strict interpretation of the
phrase “there exists” as “we can construct”. In
order to work constructively, we need to re-interpret not only the
existential quantifier but all the logical connectives and quantifiers
as instructions on how to construct a proof of the statement involving
these logical expressions.


In this article we introduce modern constructive mathematics based on
the BHK-interpretation of the logical connectives and quantifiers. We
discuss four major varieties of constructive mathematics, with
particular emphasis on the two varieties associated with Errett Bishop
and Per Martin-Löf, which can be regarded as minimal constructive
systems. We then outline progress in (informal) constructive reverse
mathematics, a research programme seeking to identify principles, such
as Brouwer’s fan theorem, that, added to the minimal constructive
varieties, facilitate proofs of important analytic theorems. After a brief discussion of constructive algebra, economics, and finance, the entry ends with two appendices: one on certain logical principles that hold in classical, intuitionistic, and recursive mathematics and which, added to Bishop's constructive mathematics, facilitate the proof of certain useful theorems of analysis; and one discussing approaches to a constructive development of general topology.

Philosophy of Mathematics,0.8906813263893127,0.6481724381446838,"

If mathematics is regarded as a science, then the philosophy of
mathematics can be regarded as a branch of the philosophy of science,
next to disciplines such as the philosophy of physics and the
philosophy of biology. However, because of its subject matter, the
philosophy of mathematics occupies a special place in the philosophy
of science. Whereas the natural sciences investigate entities that are
located in space in time, it is not at all obvious that this also the
case of the objects that are studied in mathematics. In addition to
that, the methods of investigation of mathematics differ markedly from
the methods of investigation in the natural sciences. Whereas the
latter acquire general knowledge using inductive methods, mathematical
knowledge appears to be acquired in a different way: by deduction from
basic principles. The status of mathematical knowledge also appears to
differ from the status of knowledge in the natural sciences. The
theories of the natural sciences appear to be less certain and more
open to revision than mathematical theories. For these reasons
mathematics poses problems of a quite distinctive kind for philosophy.
Therefore philosophers have accorded special attention to ontological
and epistemological questions concerning mathematics.

Indispensability Arguments in the Philosophy of Mathematics,0.8832008838653564,0.6215118765830994,"


One of the most intriguing features of mathematics is its
applicability to empirical science. Every branch of science draws upon
large and often diverse portions of mathematics, from the use of
Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics to the use of differential
geometry in general relativity. It's not just the physical sciences
that avail themselves of the services of mathematics either. Biology,
for instance, makes extensive use of difference equations and
statistics. The roles mathematics plays in these theories is also
varied. Not only does mathematics help with empirical predictions, it
allows elegant and economical statement of many theories. Indeed, so
important is the language of mathematics to science, that it is hard
to imagine how theories such as quantum mechanics and general
relativity could even be stated without employing a substantial amount
of mathematics.  


From the rather remarkable but seemingly uncontroversial fact that
mathematics is indispensable to science, some philosophers have drawn
serious metaphysical conclusions. In particular, Quine (1976; 1980a;
1980b; 1981a; 1981c) and Putnam (1979a; 1979b) have argued that the
indispensability of mathematics to empirical science gives us good
reason to believe in the existence of mathematical entities. According
to this line of argument, reference to (or quantification over)
mathematical entities such as sets, numbers, functions and such is
indispensable to our best scientific theories, and so we ought to be
committed to the existence of these mathematical entities. To do
otherwise is to be guilty of what Putnam has called “intellectual
dishonesty” (Putnam 1979b, p. 347). Moreover, mathematical entities are
seen to be on an epistemic par with the other theoretical entities of
science, since belief in the existence of the former is justified by
the same evidence that confirms the theory as a whole (and hence belief
in the latter). This argument is known as the Quine-Putnam
indispensability argument for mathematical realism. There are other
indispensability
 arguments,
 but this one is by far the most
influential, and so in what follows I'll mostly focus on it. 


In general, an indispensability argument is an argument that purports
to establish the truth of some claim based on the indispensability of
the claim in question for certain purposes (to be specified by the
particular argument). For example, if explanation is
specified as the purpose, then we have an explanatory indispensability
argument. Thus we see that inference to the best explanation is a
special case of an indispensability argument. See the introduction of
Field (1989, pp.  14-20) for a nice discussion of indispensability
arguments and inference to the best explanation. See also Maddy (1992)
and Resnik (1995a) for variations on the Quine-Putnam version of the
argument.  I should add that although the version of the argument
presented here is generally attributed to Quine and Putnam, it differs
in a number of ways from the arguments advanced by either Quine or
Putnam.[1]

ontological and epistemological. Methodological naturalism states that
the only authoritative standards are those of science. Ontological and

all valid methods of inquiry are in some sense natural. In philosophy
of mathematics of the past few decades methodological naturalism has

Nominalism about mathematics (or mathematical nominalism) is the view according to which either mathematical objects, relations, and structures do not exist at all, or they do not exist as abstract objects (they are neither located in space-time nor do they have causal powers). In the latter case, some suitable concrete replacement for mathematical objects is provided. Broadly speaking, there are two forms of mathematical nominalism: those views that require the reformulation of mathematical (or scientific) theories in order to avoid the commitment to mathematical objects (e.g., Field 1980; Hellman 1989), and those views that do not reformulate mathematical or scientific theories and offer instead an account of how no commitment to mathematical objects is involved when these theories are used (e.g., Azzouni 2004). Both forms of nominalism are examined, and they are assessed in light of how they address five central problems in the philosophy of mathematics (namely, problems dealing with the epistemology, the ontology, and the application of mathematics as well as the use of a uniform semantics and the proviso that mathematical and scientific theories be taken literally).

Platonism in the Philosophy of Mathematics,0.8868342638015747,0.6409775018692017,"


Platonism about mathematics (or mathematical platonism) is
the metaphysical view that there are abstract mathematical objects
whose existence is independent of us and our language, thought, and
practices. Just as electrons and planets exist independently of us, so
do numbers and sets. And just as statements about electrons and planets
are made true or false by the objects with which they are concerned and
these objects’ perfectly objective properties, so are statements about
numbers and sets. Mathematical truths are therefore discovered, not
invented.


The most important argument for the existence of abstract
mathematical objects derives from Gottlob Frege and goes as follows
(Frege 1953). The language of mathematics purports to refer to and
quantify over abstract mathematical objects. And a great number of
mathematical theorems are true. But a sentence cannot be true unless
its sub-expressions succeed in doing what they purport to do. So there
exist abstract mathematical objects that these expressions refer to and
quantify over.


Frege’s argument notwithstanding, philosophers have developed a
variety of objections to mathematical platonism. Thus, abstract
mathematical objects are claimed to be epistemologically inaccessible
and metaphysically problematic. Mathematical platonism has been among
the most hotly debated topics in the philosophy of mathematics over the
past few decades.

Wittgenstein's Philosophy of Mathematics,0.8707219958305359,0.6544374823570251,"

Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Philosophy of Mathematics is undoubtedly
the most unknown and under-appreciated part of his philosophical opus.
Indeed, more than half of Wittgenstein’s writings from 1929
through 1944 are devoted to mathematics, a fact that Wittgenstein
himself emphasized in 1944 by writing that his “chief
contribution has been in the philosophy of mathematics” (Monk
1990: 466).

The core of Wittgenstein’s conception of mathematics is very
much set by the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1922;
hereafter Tractatus), where his main aim is to work out the
language-reality connection by determining what is required for
language, or language usage, to be about the world.
Wittgenstein answers this question, in part, by asserting that the
only genuine propositions that we can use to make assertions about
reality are contingent (‘empirical’) propositions, which
are true if they agree with reality and false otherwise (4.022, 4.25,
4.062, 2.222). From this it follows that all other apparent
propositions are pseudo-propositions of various types and that all
other uses of ‘true’ and ‘truth’ deviate
markedly from the truth-by-correspondence (or agreement) that
contingent propositions have in relation to reality. Thus, from the
Tractatus to at least 1944, Wittgenstein maintains that
“mathematical propositions” are not real propositions and
that “mathematical truth” is essentially non-referential
and purely syntactical in nature. On Wittgenstein’s view, we
invent mathematical calculi and we expand mathematics by calculation
and proof, and though we learn from a proof that a theorem
can be derived from axioms by means of certain rules in a
particular way, it is not the case that this proof-path
pre-exists our construction of it.

As we shall see, Wittgenstein’s Philosophy of Mathematics begins
in a rudimentary way in the Tractatus, develops into a
finitistic constructivism in the middle period (Philosophical
Remarks (1929–30) and Philosophical Grammar
(1931–33), respectively; hereafter PR and PG,
respectively), and is further developed in new and old directions in
the manuscripts used for
Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics (1937–44;
hereafter RFM). As Wittgenstein’s substantive views on
mathematics evolve from 1918 through 1944, his writing and
philosophical styles evolve from the assertoric, aphoristic
style of the Tractatus to a clearer, argumentative style in
the middle period, to a dialectical, interlocutory style in
RFM and the Philosophical Investigations (hereafter
PI).

John M. E. McTaggart,0.8385857343673706,0.4831831753253937,"


John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart, henceforth simply
“McTaggart”, was one of the most important systematic
metaphysicians of the early 20th century. His greatest work
is The Nature of Existence, the first volume of which was
published in 1921 while the second volume was published posthumously
in 1927 with C.D. Broad as the editor of the manuscript. In addition,
he authored many important articles on metaphysics, including his
famous “The Unreality of Time” in 1908, some of which are
collected in his Philosophical Studies (1934). 


McTaggart was also a dedicated interpreter and champion of Hegel, and
in addition to many articles on the Hegelian philosophy, he published
the following books: Studies in the Hegelian Dialectic (1896,
2nd edition printed in 1922), which contains a painstaking
discussion of the nature of the dialectic as well as the results
achieved by its means, many of which are conclusions that McTaggart
continued to argue for throughout his career, including among them
that time is unreal, that existence exhausts reality, that modal
notions cannot be applied to reality as a whole, and that absolute
reality contains imperfections; Studies in Hegelian Cosmology
(1901, 2nd edition printed in 1918), in which cosmology is
understood as the discipline that applies a priori conclusions to
those entities and features that we are acquainted with via
experience, such as selves, the universe, and good and evil, and in
which topics ranging from the ethical status of punishment and the
nature of sin to whether the absolute is a person, whether human
beings are immortal, or whether Hegel is a Christian are discussed in
great detail; and A Commentary on Hegel's Logic (1910), which
consists of a critical commentary on the alleged logical connections
between various categories by which experience must be organized and
the various transitions that lead one from Hegel's category of Being
to the category of Absolute Idea.


The extent to which McTaggart's interpretations of Hegel are
correct is not a matter on which I am competent to determine. For what
it is worth, McTaggart's work on Hegel does not appear to be
highly regarded by contemporary scholars of Hegel, insofar as this is
reflected in the paucity of references to
McTaggart's
 interpretations.[1]
In what follows, I will spend little time on those works of McTaggart
that occupy themselves with the Hegelian philosophy. This is
unfortunate, since this might give the impression that grappling with
Hegel's philosophy was merely a side project for McTaggart rather
than a task of much importance for his philosophical development. In
his Commentary on Hegel's Logic, McTaggart tells us that
the exposition of Hegel's philosophy has been the chief object of
his life for the last twenty-one
 years (Commentary on Hegel's Logic, 311).
McTaggart's Hegelianism was also
important for the development of other philosophers such as Bertrand
Russell, whose early work was inspired by the idealism defended by
McTaggart in his Studies of the Hegelian
 Dialectic.[3]
 However, it is
worth noting that McTaggart himself later abandoned the dialectical
method that he took to be central to Hegel's own
metaphysics.


The plan for this article is as follows. Section 1 will provide
biographical information about McTaggart. I will then begin to discuss
the central themes of McTaggart's philosophy. Section 2 focuses on
McTaggart's views on the methods of metaphysics. Section 3 discusses
McTaggart's famous argument for the unreality of time.  Section 4 will
focus on McTaggart's philosophy of religion, which was a kind of
atheistic mysticism. Section 5 will focus on
McTaggart's ontological idealism, which is a view akin to the
idealism of Leibniz and Berkeley. Section 6 will focus on McTaggart's
position on what was perhaps the central metaphysical debate of his
period, namely, the issue of monism vs.
pluralism as well as the concordant issue of the reality of
relations. Section 7 will be devoted to a smorgasbord of topics of
interest to contemporary metaphysicians, including McTaggart's
views on parts and wholes, the distinction between existence
and reality, and questions about essentialism.


Section 8 will be the final part of this article, and will focus on
McTaggart's views on ethics. I will discuss McTaggart's views on the
nature of intrinsic value, focusing on the questions of to what
ontological category the bearers of intrinsic value belong and what
kinds of features determine the intrinsic value of these entities.  I
will also discuss McTaggart's views on love, the emotion that he
accords the highest place in his ethical system.

George Herbert Mead (1863–1931), American philosopher and social
theorist, is often classed with William James, Charles Sanders Peirce,

American pragmatism. Dewey referred to Mead as “a seminal mind
of the very first order” (Dewey, 1932, xl). Yet by the middle of
the twentieth-century, Mead's prestige was greatest outside of
professional philosophical circles. He is considered by many to be the
father of the school of Symbolic Interactionism in sociology and
social psychology, although he did not use this nomenclature. Perhaps
Mead's principal influence in philosophical circles occurred as a
result of his friendship with John Dewey. There is little question
that Mead and Dewey had an enduring influence on each other, with Mead
contributing an original theory of the development of the self through
communication. This theory has in recent years played a central role
in the work of Jürgen Habermas. While Mead is best known for his
work on the nature of the self and intersubjectivity, he also
developed a theory of action, and a metaphysics or philosophy of
nature that emphasizes emergence and temporality, in which the past
and future are viewed through the lens of the present. Although the
extent of Mead's reach is considerable, he never published a

The Normativity of Meaning and Content,0.63582444190979,0.6072421073913574,"


There is a long tradition of thinking of language as conventional in
its nature, dating back at least to Aristotle (De
Interpretatione). By appealing to the role of conventions, it is
thought, we can distinguish linguistic signs, the meaningful
use of words, from mere natural ‘signs’. During the last
century the thesis that language is essentially conventional has played
a central role within philosophy of language, and has even been called
a platitude (Lewis 1969). More recently, the focus has been less on the
conventional nature of language than on the claim that meaning is
essentially normative in a wider sense, leaving it open whether the
normativity in question should be understood in terms of conventions or
not (Kripke 1982).


Normativism is not limited to language, however – versions of
it have also been defended in the case of mental content. It has been
suggested that a mental state has content only if there are certain
norms in force for it. According to many, the essentially normative
aspect of meaning and content reflects a deep-lying contrast between
mind and nature.
 This essay discusses a number of central normativist theses with
respect to meaning as well as to content. We begin by identifying
different versions of meaning normativism, presenting the arguments
that have been put forth for and against them. We then continue by
discussing content normativism, providing an overview of the
contemporary debate. Both debates are very much on-going and at this
point there is little consensus as to whether normativism holds for
either meaning or content. Since the first publication of this essay
much of the debate has focused on two of its central issues: First, it
has been debated whether meaning normativism can be derived from the
fact that meaningful expressions necessarily have correctness
conditions. This is the argument we labelled the ‘the simple
argument’ and in section 2.1.1 we discuss recent contributions
to the debate. Second, the nature of rule-guidance has been much
discussed, in particular relating to content normativism, and new
proposals have been made as to how it is to be understood. We discuss
this in sections 2.2 and 3.2. It has also been argued, however, that
the normativity essential to meaning (and content) is of a more
‘primitive’ character than has so far been recognized in
the debate. We discuss this in section 2.1.1, 2.2.1, and specifically
in section 2.2.4.

Word Meaning,0.7780834436416626,0.682332456111908,"
Word meaning has played a somewhat marginal role in early
contemporary philosophy of language, which was primarily concerned
with the structural features of sentences and showed less
interest in the format of lexical representations and in the nature of
the word-level input to compositional processes. Nowadays, it is
well-established that the way we account for word meaning is bound to
have a major impact in tipping the balance in favor or against a given
picture of the fundamental properties of human language. This entry
provides an overview of the way issues related to lexical meaning have
been explored in analytic philosophy and a summary of relevant
research on the subject in neighboring scientific domains. Though the
main focus will be on philosophical problems, contributions from
linguistics, psychology, neuroscience and artificial intelligence will
also be considered, since research on word meaning is highly
interdisciplinary.

Theories of Meaning,0.7927737236022949,0.6675493717193604,"

The term “theory of meaning” has figured, in one way or
another, in a great number of philosophical disputes over the last
century. Unfortunately, this term has also been used to mean a great
number of different things. 
 Here I focus on two sorts of “theory of meaning.” The
first sort of theory—a semantic theory—is a theory which
assigns semantic contents to expressions of a language. Approaches to
semantics may be divided according to whether they assign propositions
as the meanings of sentences and, if they do, what view they take of
the nature of these propositions.
 The second sort of theory—a foundational theory of
meaning—is a theory which states the facts in virtue of which
expressions have the semantic contents that they have.  Approaches to
the foundational theory of meaning may be divided into theories which
do, and theories which do not, explain the meanings of expressions of
a language used by a group in terms of the contents of the mental
states of members of that group.

Measurement in Science,0.9199987649917604,0.3173992931842804,"
Measurement is an integral part of modern science as well as of
engineering, commerce, and daily life. Measurement is often
considered a hallmark of the scientific enterprise and a privileged
source of knowledge relative to qualitative modes of
inquiry.[1]
Despite its ubiquity and importance, there is little consensus among
philosophers as to how to define measurement, what sorts of things
are measurable, or which conditions make measurement possible. Most
(but not all) contemporary authors agree that measurement is an
activity that involves interaction with a concrete system with the
aim of representing aspects of that system in abstract terms (e.g.,
in terms of classes, numbers, vectors etc.) But this characterization
also fits various kinds of perceptual and linguistic activities that
are not usually considered measurements, and is therefore too broad
to count as a definition of measurement.  Moreover, if
“concrete” implies “real”, this
characterization is also too narrow, as measurement often involves
the representation of ideal systems such as the average household or
an electron at complete rest.
Philosophers have written on a variety of conceptual, metaphysical,
semantic and epistemological issues related to measurement. This entry
will survey the central philosophical standpoints on the nature of
measurement, the notion of measurable quantity and related
epistemological issues. It will refrain from elaborating on the many
discipline-specific problems associated with measurement and focus on
issues that have a general character.

Philosophy of Medicine,0.6737713217735289,0.6921437978744507,"

Philosophy of medicine is a field that seeks to explore fundamental
issues in theory, research, and practice within the health sciences,
particularly metaphysical and epistemological topics. Its historic
roots arguably date back to ancient times, to the Hippocratic corpus
among other sources, and there have been extended scholarly
discussions on key concepts in the philosophy of medicine since at
least the 1800s. Debates have occurred in the past over whether there
is a distinct field rightly termed “philosophy of
medicine” (e.g., Caplan 1992) but as there are now dedicated
journals and professional organizations, a relatively well-established
canon of scholarly literature, and distinctive questions and problems,
it is defensible to claim that philosophy of medicine has now
established itself. Although ethics and values are part of many
problems addressed within the philosophy of medicine, bioethics is
generally considered to be a distinct field, and hence is not explored
in this entry (but see the entry on 
 theory and bioethics).  
That being said, philosophy of medicine serves as a foundation for
many debates within bioethics, given that it analyzes fundamental
components of the practice of medicine that frequently arise in
bioethics such as concepts of disease. The philosophy of medicine also
has made important contributions to general philosophy of science, and
particularly to understandings of explanation, causation, and
experimentation as well as debates over applications of scientific
knowledge. Finally, the philosophy of medicine has contributed to
discussions on methods and goals within both research and practice in
the medical and health sciences. This entry focuses primarily on
philosophy of medicine in the Western tradition, although there are
growing literatures on philosophy of non-Western and alternative
medical practices. It emphasizes philosophical literature while
utilizing relevant scholarly publications from other disciplinary
perspectives.

Literary Forms of Medieval Philosophy,0.6822375059127808,0.1746969074010849,"


Medieval philosophical texts are written in a variety of literary 
forms, many peculiar to the period, like the summa or 
disputed question; others, like the commentary, dialogue, and axiom, 
are also found in ancient and modern sources but are substantially 
different in the medieval period from their classical or modern 
instantiations of these forms. Many philosophical texts also have a highly polemical 
style and/or seem deferential to the authoritative sources they cite.
Further, medieval philosophical thinkers operated under the threat of
censure from political and religious authority, moving them, some 
have argued, to write esoterically or indirectly to protect themselves
from persecution for their true views. All these literary and rhetorical features make 
medieval philosophical texts considerably more difficult to 
understand and interpret than modern or even classical philosophical 
texts. Moreover, the broad range of genres used in medieval 
philosophy raises questions about the nature of philosophical writing
in general when compared to the much more restricted set of accepted 
forms in modern and contemporary philosophical works.

Mental Representation in Medieval Philosophy,0.66501784324646,0.2257533222436905,"
 The notions of mental representation and intentionality are
intrinsically related in contemporary philosophy of mind, since it is
usually thought that a mental state has content or is about something
other than itself due to its representational nature. These notions
have a parallel history in medieval philosophy as well, but it has
been intentionality that has attracted medieval scholars’
attention (for example, in Knudsen 1982, Pasnau 1997, Perler 2001 and
Perler 2002). There have only been a few studies on mental
representation (Tweedale 1990, Pasnau 1997, King 2007 and Lagerlund
2007a).


One major reason for the interest in intentionality in medieval
philosophy is that it has been widely recognized that Franz Brentano
was reviving a scholastic notion when he introduced intentionality as
“the mark of the mental” (Brentano 1874). But Brentano never used the
terminology of representation to explicate intentionality. This was
done much later, in post-Wittgensteinian philosophy of mind. In later
medieval philosophy, it was, however, standard to explain the content
of a thought by referring to its representational nature.


There are a variety of theories of mental representation in medieval
philosophy, which were intensely discussed from the twelfth century up
to the time of Descartes. This article will briefly trace the history
of the terminology and also give a brief outline of the main theories
developed during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.

Medieval Theories of Modality,0.6940556764602661,0.14722543954849246,"

There are four modal paradigms in ancient philosophy: the frequency
interpretation of modality, the model of possibility as a potency, the
model of antecedent necessities and possibilities with respect to a
certain moment of time (diachronic modalities), and the model of
possibility as non-contradictoriness. None of these conceptions, which
were well known to early medieval thinkers through the works of
Boethius, was based on the idea of modality as involving reference to
simultaneous alternatives. This new paradigm was introduced into
Western thought in early twelfth-century discussions influenced by
Augustine’s theological conception of God as acting by choice
between alternative histories.

While the new idea of associating modal terms with simultaneous
alternatives was used also in thirteenth-century theology, it was not
often discussed in philosophical contexts. The increasing acceptance
of Aristotle’s philosophy in the thirteenth century gave support
to traditional modal paradigms, as is seen in Robert Kilwardby’s
influential commentary on Aristotle’s Prior Analytics,
in which modal syllogistic is treated as an essentialist theory of the
structures of being. There were analogous discussions of philosophical
and theological modalities in Arabic philosophy. Arabic modal theories
influenced Latin discussions mainly through the translations of
Averroes’s works.

John Duns Scotus developed the conception of modality as
alternativeness into a detailed theory. A logically possible state of
affairs is something to which to be is not repugnant, though it may
not be compossible with other possibilities. Scotus’s modal
semantics influenced early fourteenth-century philosophy and theology
in many ways. Thirteenth-century essentialist assumptions were dropped
from modal syllogistic, the Aristotelian version of which was regarded
as a fragmentary theory without a sufficient explication of the
various fine structures of modal propositions.

Medieval Theories of Practical Reason,0.5342592597007751,0.5940632820129395,"


Medieval theories of moral reasoning have their origins in the moral
theology of St. Augustine and the rational ethics of Aristotle. Until
the thirteenth century Augustine's responses to questions concerning
free will, predestination, the nature of goodness, and divine freedom
dominated moral speculation in the Latin West. For Augustine morality
demands the human will's conformity to the prescriptions of the
immutable, necessary and eternal law. Augustine argues in his work on
free will that the eternal law “is called supreme reason, which must
always be obeyed, and through it the evil deserve an unhappy life and
the good a blessed life; and through this law we have derived temporal
laws rightly constructed and correctly emended.” The ideals of eternal
law are universally imprinted upon human intellects and are the
immutable standards by which human actions may be judged.

Medieval Theories: Properties of Terms,0.7310562133789062,0.19955648481845856,"


The theory of properties of terms (proprietates terminorum)
was the basis of the medievals' semantic theory. It embraced those
properties of linguistic expressions necessary to explain truth,
fallacy and inference, the three central concepts of logical analysis.
The theory evolved out of the work of Anselm and Abelard at the turn of
the twelfth century, developed steadily through the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries and was still undergoing changes in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries. It is generally agreed that its early stages
were closely bound up with the theory of fallacies, but as a general
semantic theory, it developed in response to a variety of needs, and
one mistake of modern attempts at interpretation is to seek a unique
rationale of one notion or another. Each notion evolved continually,
satisfying one need at one time and another at a later date, and often
several conflicting needs at the same time. Another mistake is to try
to map each notion seriatim onto corresponding notions in
contemporary semantic theory, but although one can see analogies and
similarities, none of the medieval “properties” matches exactly any
modern notion.

Medieval Theories of Singular Terms,0.7223321199417114,0.18973782658576965,"


A singular term, such as a proper name or a demonstrative pronoun, is
a term that signifies exactly one individual thing. The existence of
singular terms raises various questions about how they function within
a language. Do proper names have a sense as well as a referent? If
they do have a sense, what is it, and how do they acquire it? How is
this sense transmitted from one speaker to another? Is a demonstrative
pronoun purely referential? If one believes in a language of thought,
or mental language, as did many medieval thinkers, what is the mental
correlate of a singular term? While medieval thinkers did not produce
any treatises devoted to singular terms, their writings do contain
answers to these questions, or at least, answers to similar questions
that they themselves posed in the context of their own semantic
theories. To discover medieval views of singular terms, one must
consult a variety of sources from grammar, logic, metaphysics, and
even theology. Priscian, the semantically-oriented grammarian who
wrote at the beginning of the sixth century C.E., was particularly
influential, and his views were repeated by many later grammarians, as
well as by logicians and theologians. Porphyry's Isagoge, or
introduction to Aristotle's Categories, was another important
source, especially as his discussion allowed commentators to relate
linguistic problems to metaphysical problems concerning the nature of
the individual named by a singular term. Commentaries on Aristotle's
Categories discussed singular terms as examples of equivocal
terms, those having more than one sense. Later in the Middle Ages and
at the beginning of the sixteenth century, singular terms were
discussed in treatises devoted to types of terms. Paul of Venice's
treatise is worthy of special mention here, despite the difficulty of
construing many of his claims.  Because the use of singular terms was
tied to singular concepts, they were also discussed in commentaries on
Aristotle's Physics, De anima, and
Metaphysics. The commentaries of John Buridan (d. after 1358)
provide the richest and most coherent medieval theory, and one which
remained influential into the sixteenth century. During the sixteenth
century, singular concepts remained a subject of discussion in
commentaries on Aristotle's Physics and De anima, but
unfortunately the logicians who came after Domingo de Soto (1494–1560)
reverted to a very cursory treatment of singular terms. We have to
wait for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries for a rediscovery of
some of the problems that had exercised John Buridan in the fourteenth
century.

Medieval Theories of the Syllogism,0.6947816014289856,0.14163799583911896,"

Aristotle's theory of the syllogism played an important role in the
Western and Near Eastern intellectual traditions for more than two
thousand years, but it was during the Middle Ages that it became the
dominant model of correct argumentation. 

Historically, medieval logic is divided into the old logic (logica
vetus), the tradition stretching from Boethius (c. 480–525)
until Abelard (1079–1142), and the new logic (logica
nova), from the late twelfth century until the Renaissance. The
division reflects the availability of ancient logical texts. Before
Abelard, medieval logicians were only familiar with Aristotle's
Categories and On Interpretation and Porphyry's
Isagoge or Introduction to the Categories and not
the Prior Analytics, where Aristotle develops the theory of
the syllogism — though they did know something of his theory
through secondary sources. Once the Prior Analytics
reappeared in the West in the middle of the twelfth century,
commentaries on it began appearing in the late twelfth and early
thirteenth centuries.

Aristotle's theory of the syllogism for assertoric (non-modal)
sentences was a remarkable achievement and virtually complete in the
Prior Analytics. To quote Kant, it was “a closed and
completed body of doctrine.” Medieval logicians could not add
much to it, though small changes were sometimes made and it was
systematized in different ways. It was not until the mid-fourteenth
century, when John Buridan reworked logic in general and placed the
theory of the syllogism in the context of the more comprehensive logic
of consequence, that people's understanding of syllogistic logic began
to change.

The theory of the modal syllogism, however, was incomplete in the
Prior Analytics, and in the hands of medieval logicians it
saw a remarkable development. The first commentators tried to save
Aristotle's original theory and in the course of doing so produced
some interesting logical theories, though in the end they were unable
to make the system work. The next generation of logicians simply
abandoned the idea of saving Aristotle and instead introduced new
distinctions and developed a completely new theory that subsumed the
logic of syllogisms.

The theory of the syllogisms developed independently in the Arabic
tradition. Although there was some influence on the Latin tradition
through Averroes, the dominant influence was Avicenna, who made
several changes to Aristotle's theory and eventually became the sole
authority.

so-called ‘most common notions’ (communissima),
such as ‘one’ (unum), ‘true’

the inner relations and order between these concepts. In contrast to
early modern accounts of the transcendental, these medieval theories
regard the transcendental notions as properties of being and deal with
the transcendentals within a conception of metaphysics as a ‘real
science’ (scientia realis). The introduction of
the doctrine of the transcendentals fundamentally transformed the
medieval conception of metaphysics: it became the ‘common

‘first philosophy’ in a new sense. Medieval theories of the

transcendental concepts and the systems of conceptual differentiation;
the conceptual unity that is granted to them (analogy vs. univocity),
and the way the transcendentals relate to the divine.

Alexius Meinong,0.7293274998664856,0.5167060494422913,"


Alexius Meinong Ritter von Handschuchsheim (b. 1853, d. 1920) was an
Austrian philosopher and psychologist who worked at the University of
Graz from 1882 until his death. He became renowned for the so called
theory of objects ([Gegenstandstheorie], 1904), a
kind of ontological account that tries to introduce and consider
systematically not only existent but also non-existent objects. His
approach is not only shaped by Franz Brentano's descriptive
psychology, a form of phenomenology, and its connected notion of
intentionality (directedness), but also by the British
empiricists. Continuing and modifying Brentano's philosophical
psychology, Meinong most notably provided original contributions to
ontology and metaphysics, to epistemology, and to value theory.


In this vein, for example, he tried to lay new foundations for the
theory of value by going back to value-feelings (emotions) as its
psychological basis. But although Meinong had constantly recognized the
fundamental role of psychology in philosophy, he became more and more
an opponent of psychologism. The distinction between the
“psychological” (mental) content and the object of a mental
act, introduced in 1899, became a hallmark of his
anti-psychologism.


Meinong found a sympathetic reader in Bertrand Russell. However,
Russell later rejected both Meinong's object theory, with its
conception of non-being, and his philosophical psychology, which
conceives consciousness as a relation to objects via mental contents.
Russell's criticism was mainly responsible for Meinong's
international recognition. On the one hand, Russell made Meinong
notorious. On the other hand, the controversy with Russell also became
an incentive for the development of Meinongian versions of logic and
semantics as a serious alternative to classical logic and
semantics.

Memory,0.7037239074707031,0.3951225876808167,"

Memory plays important roles in many areas of philosophy. It is vital
to our knowledge of the world in general and of the personal past in
particular. It underwrites our identities as individuals and our ties
to other people. Philosophical interest in memory thus dates back to
antiquity and has remained prominent throughout the history of
philosophy (Aho 2014; Bloch 2014; Burnham 1888; Herrmann
& Chaffinn 1988; Nikulin 2015). More recently,
memory has come to be recognized as a topic of major philosophical
importance in its own right, with the emergence of the philosophy of
memory as a distinct field of research (Bernecker &
Michaelian 2017).

Much of the impetus for the emergence of the field was due to a trend,
beginning in the late 1990s, towards increased interdisciplinarity
among philosophers working on memory (Hoerl &
McCormack 2001; Sutton 1998), a trend which reinvigorated and transformed
older philosophical debates by bringing them into contact with empirical and
theoretical developments in psychology and the sciences of memory more
broadly. To cite just two examples among the many discussed below,
empirical research on the constructive character of remembering has
intensified philosophical debates over the viability of the
influential causal theory of memory (Robins 2016b) and the associated
concept of memory traces (De Brigard 2014b), while theoretical
frameworks which situate remembering as a form of imaginative mental
time travel have lent new urgency to longstanding debates over the
relationship between memory and imagination (Debus 2014; Perrin
& Michaelian 2017).

The interdisciplinary character of the field notwithstanding, the
concerns of philosophers of memory remain distinct from those of
memory researchers in other disciplines, and, while this entry
discusses the latter where they are of direct philosophical relevance,
its focus is squarely on the former. Given the roles played by memory
in other areas, the philosophy of memory inevitably overlaps with many
other fields of research. Three core areas of activity can
nevertheless be discerned, with most researchers approaching memory
from the perspectives of philosophy of mind, epistemology, or ethics.
The bulk of this entry—sections
2–8—focuses on research
on memory from the perspective of philosophy of mind, often referred to
as the metaphysics of memory (Bernecker 2008). There is
a separate entry on the 
  epistemology of memory, 
so this area is discussed only briefly here,
in section 9. Key issues in the ethics of memory are reviewed in
section 10.

Epistemological Problems of Memory,0.701836884021759,0.3947900235652924,"


That most of our knowledge is in memory at any particular time is a
given.  What is perhaps surprising, however, is the degree to which
even our current conscious knowledge typically depends on memory.  For
example, you look at the sky and come to believe that the sunset is
beautiful.  This is a newly formed belief about an event currently
taking place.  Nevertheless, its justification is no doubt dependent
on other beliefs that you hold.  For example, if you didn't at least
tacitly believe that you were looking west or that it is evening and
not morning, the belief wouldn't be justified (I assume that the
phenomenology of sunsets and sunrises is indistinguishable). Now I am
not, however, supposing that all knowledge of the external world is
inferential. Your belief that the sky is red might well be
epistemically basic.  Nor am I insisting that your sunset belief is
psychologically inferential.  My only claim here is that many
relatively simple beliefs we form about the external world typically
depend for their justification on background beliefs; and background
beliefs are memory beliefs.
Yet the matter of the epistemology of memory belief is important
for its own sake as well. Virtually all of what we know (or are
justified in believing) at any given time resides in memory.  However,
epistemology has been focussed almost exclusively, even if implicitly,
on the epistemology of belief formation — of coming to
believe a proposition.  Yet it is not at all clear that the conditions
necessary and sufficient for justifiably coming to believing a
proposition are necessary and sufficient for justifiably maintaining
it.  So if we are to understand how we know the vast majority of what
we know at any given time, we'll need an account of the epistemology
of memory. This essay will focus on the issues that arise when one
attempts to construct such a thing.
The nature of memory was hotly debated in the early modern period
by British empiricists David Hume and John Locke, and by Scottish
Common Sense Realist Thomas Reid.  Our selective excursion into
historical discussions will also include a consideration of Bertrand
Russell's from The Analysis of Mind.  We'll conclude our
historical review with the briefest of surveys from the small
literature of the second half of the last century.
With our limited survey completed, we'll next clarify the various
ways that “memory belief” can be construed. This turns out to
be a more complicated business than one might have thought.  Having
made a number of relevant distinctions and defined our terms, we'll at
last be prepared to consider how different kinds of theories account
for the justification of that which we remember.  Finally, we'll have
a look at the prospects for demonstrating the general reliability of
memory.

Moses Mendelssohn,0.5861945748329163,0.4353455007076264,"


Moses Mendelssohn (b. 1729, d. 1786) was a creative and eclectic
thinker whose writings on metaphysics and aesthetics, political theory
and theology, together with his Jewish heritage, placed him at the
focal point of the German Enlightenment for over three decades. While
Mendelssohn found himself at home with a metaphysics derived from
writings of Leibniz, Wolff, and Baumgarten, he was also one of his
age's most accomplished literary critics. His highly regarded pieces on
works of Homer and Aesop, Pope and Burke, Maupertuis and Rousseau
— to cite only a fraction of his numerous critical essays —
appeared in a series of journals that he co-edited with G. E. Lessing
and Friedrich Nicolai. Dubbed “the Jewish Luther,” Mendelssohn also
contributed significantly to the life of the Jewish community and
letters in Germany, campaigning for Jews' civil rights and translating
the Pentateuch and the Psalms into German. Not surprisingly, as a Jew
with an unwavering belief in the harmonizing effects of rational
analysis and discourse, Mendelssohn rankled both institutional and
self-appointed advocates of Christianity as well as Judaism. Thus,
Johann Lavater infamously challenged him to refute the arguments of the
Pietist theologian, Charles Bonnet, or convert to Christianity (a
challenge that Mendelssohn effectively disabled with a plea for
tolerance and a series of reasons for refraining from such religious
controversy). Similarly, some Jewish thinkers took exception to
Mendelssohn's Jerusalem, or on Religious Power and Judaism and
its argument for conceiving Judaism as a religion founded upon reason
alone. In addition to the “Lavater affair” and his work as editor and
critic, Mendelssohn was probably best known to his contemporaries for
his penetrating accounts of the experience of the sublime, for lucid
arguments for the soul's immortality and God's existence, for his close
association with G. E. Lessing, for his  protracted “pantheism
dispute” (Pantheismusstreit) with Jacobi during the 1780s, and for
his insistence that Lessing was not the Spinozist that Jacobi portrayed
him to be. To posterity he is perhaps best known as the model for
Nathan der Weise, the protagonist in Lessing's famous play of
the same name, championing religious tolerance.

Causal Theories of Mental Content,0.7902302742004395,0.4502773582935333,"

Causal theories of mental content attempt to explain how thoughts can
be about things. They attempt to explain how one can think about, for
example, dogs. These theories begin with the idea that there are
mental representations and that thoughts are meaningful in virtue of a
causal connection between a mental representation and some part of the
world that is represented. In other words, the point of departure for
these theories is that thoughts of dogs are about dogs because dogs
cause the mental representations of dogs.

Many of our mental states such as beliefs and desires are
intentional mental states, or mental states with content.
Externalism with regard to mental content says that in order
to have certain types of intentional mental states (e.g. beliefs), it
is necessary to be related to the environment in the right way.
Internalism (or individualism) denies this, and it
affirms that having those intentional mental states depends solely on
our intrinsic properties. This debate has important consequences with
regard to philosophical and empirical theories of the mind, and the
role of social institutions and the physical environment in
constituting the mind. It also raises other interesting questions
concerning such matters as the explanatory relevance of content and the
possibility of a priori self-knowledge.

“broad” or “wide” content, which depends on
features of the individual's environment as well as on features of the
individual. It is controversial whether there is any such thing as
narrow content. Assuming that there is, it is also controversial what

Teleological Theories of Mental Content,0.7903506755828857,0.4440191090106964,"


Teleological theories of mental content try to explain the contents
of mental representations by appealing to a teleological notion of
function. Take, for example, the thought that blossoms are forming. On
a representational theory of thought, this thought involves a
representation of blossoms forming.  A theory of content aims among
other things to tell us why this representation has that content; it
aims to say why it is a thought about blossoms forming rather than
about the sun shining or pigs flying or nothing at all. In general, a
theory of content tries to say why a mental representation counts as
representing what it represents.


According to teleological theories of content, what a representation
represents depends on the functions of the systems that produce or use
the representation. The relevant notion of function is said to be the
one that is used in biology and neurobiology in attributing functions
to components of organisms (as in “the function of the pineal
gland is secreting melatonin” and “the function of brain
area MT is processing information about motion”).  Proponents of
teleological theories of content generally understand such functions
to be what the thing with the function was selected for, either by
ordinary natural selection or by some other natural process of
selection.

Mental Illness,0.6835641264915466,0.6801273822784424,"


Psychiatry involves theories of the mind, theories of the causes of
mental disorders, classification schemes for those disorders, research
about the disorders, proven treatments and research into new
treatments, and a number of professions whose job it is to work with or
on behalf of people with mental disorders. The philosophical study of
psychiatry discusses conceptual, ethical, metaphysical, social, and
epistemological issues that arise in all these aspects of psychiatry.
Central to this study is the nature of mental illness.


The central philosophical debate over mental illness is not about
its existence, but rather over how to define it, and whether it can be
given a scientific or objective definition, or whether normative and
subjective elements are essential to our concept of mental
illness. One desideratum for a successful definition of mental
illness is that it will settle debates over particular purported mental
illnesses. 


The connection between philosophical issues in the study and
treatment of mental illness and these other areas of philosophy is in
many cases obvious, as in the question of when and how people with
mental disorders are responsible for their actions is connected with
the insanity defense in law, and the more general debate over the
justification of punishment. The philosophical investigation of
the nature of mental illness is therefore relevant to many other areas
of philosophy. While there is no sharp divide between the philosophical
discussion of the nature of mental illness and the wider philosophical
discussion of psychiatry, we can focus on four major issues that have
preoccupied the philosophical literature.

Mental Representation,0.7965258359909058,0.4368402361869812,"


The notion of a “mental representation” is, arguably, in the first
instance a theoretical construct of cognitive science. As such, it is a
basic concept of the Computational Theory of Mind, according to which
cognitive states and processes are constituted by the occurrence,
transformation and storage (in the mind/brain) of information-bearing
structures (representations) of one kind or another.


However, on the assumption that a representation is an object with
semantic properties (content, reference, truth-conditions,
truth-value, etc.), a mental representation may be more broadly
construed as a mental object with semantic properties. As such, mental
representations (and the states and processes that involve them) need
not be understood only in computational terms. On this broader
construal, mental representation is a philosophical topic with roots
in antiquity and a rich history and literature predating the recent
“cognitive revolution,” and which continues to be of interest in pure
philosophy. Though most contemporary philosophers of mind acknowledge
the relevance and importance of cognitive science, they vary in their
degree of engagement with its literature, methods and results; and
there remain, for many, issues concerning the representational
properties of the mind that can be addressed independently of the
computational hypothesis.


Though the term ‘Representational Theory of Mind’ is
sometimes used almost interchangeably with ‘Computational Theory
of Mind’, I will use it here to refer to any theory that
postulates the existence of semantically evaluable mental objects,
including philosophy's stock in trade mentalia — thoughts,
concepts, percepts, ideas, impressions, notions, rules, schemas,
images, phantasms, etc. — as well as the various sorts of
“subpersonal” representations postulated by cognitive
science. Representational theories may thus be contrasted with
theories, such as those of Baker (1995), Collins (1987), Dennett
(1987), Gibson (1966, 1979), Reid (1764/1997), Stich (1983) and Thau
(2002), which deny the existence of such things.

Mereology,0.8191398382186891,0.31470999121665955,"

Mereology (from the Greek μερος,
‘part’) is the theory of parthood relations: of the
relations of part to whole and the relations of part to part within a
 whole.[1]
 Its roots can be traced back to the early days of philosophy,
beginning with the Presocratics and continuing throughout the writings
of Plato (especially the Parmenides and the
Theaetetus), Aristotle (especially the Metaphysics,
but also the Physics, the Topics, and De
partibus animalium), and Boethius (especially De
Divisione and In Ciceronis Topica). Mereology occupies a
prominent role also in the writings of medieval ontologists and
scholastic philosophers such as Garland the Computist, Peter Abelard,
Thomas Aquinas, Raymond Lull, John Duns Scotus, Walter Burley, William
of Ockham, and Jean Buridan, as well as in Jungius's Logica
Hamburgensis (1638), Leibniz's Dissertatio de arte
combinatoria (1666) and Monadology (1714), and Kant's
early writings (the Gedanken of 1747 and the Monadologia
physica of 1756). As a formal theory of parthood relations,
however, mereology made its way into our times mainly through the work
of Franz Brentano and of his pupils, especially Husserl's third
Logical Investigation (1901). The latter may rightly be
considered the first attempt at a thorough formulation of a theory,
though in a format that makes it difficult to disentangle the analysis
of mereological concepts from that of other ontologically relevant
notions (such as the relation of ontological
 dependence).[2]
 It is not until Leśniewski's Foundations of the General
Theory of Sets (1916) and his Foundations of Mathematics
(1927–1931) that a pure theory of part-relations was given an
exact
 formulation.[3]
 And because Leśniewski's work was largely inaccessible to
non-speakers of Polish, it is only with the publication of Leonard and
Goodman's The Calculus of Individuals (1940), partly under
the influence of Whitehead, that mereology has become a chapter of
central interest for modern ontologists and
 metaphysicians.[4]

In the following we focus mostly on contemporary formulations of
mereology as they grew out of these recent
theories—Leśniewski's and Leonard and Goodman's. Indeed,
although such theories come in different logical guises, they are
sufficiently similar to be recognized as a common basis for most
subsequent developments. To properly assess the relative strengths and
weaknesses, however, it will be convenient to proceed in steps. First
we consider some core mereological notions and principles. Then we
proceed to an examination of the stronger theories that can be erected
on that basis.

relations (logical or metaphysical) that obtain between them. In what

Maurice Merleau-Ponty,0.6984511017799377,0.4449450671672821,"

Maurice Jean Jacques Merleau-Ponty (1908–1961), French
philosopher and public intellectual, was the leading academic
proponent of existentialism and phenomenology in post-war France. Best
known for his original and influential work on embodiment, perception,
and ontology, he also made important contributions to the philosophy
of art, history, language, nature, and politics.  Associated in his
early years with the existentialist movement through his friendship
with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty played a
central role in the dissemination of phenomenology, which he sought to
integrate with Gestalt psychology, psychoanalysis, Marxism, and
Saussurian linguistics. Major influences on his thinking include Henri
Bergson, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Max Scheler, and Jean-Paul
Sartre, as well as neurologist Kurt Goldstein, Gestalt theorists such
as Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka, and literary figures
including Marcel Proust, Paul Claudel, and Paul Valéry. In
turn, he influenced the post-structuralist generation of French
thinkers who succeeded him, including Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze,
and Jacques Derrida, whose similarities with and debt to the later
Merleau-Ponty have often been underestimated. Merleau-Ponty published
two major theoretical texts during his lifetime: The Structure of
Behavior (1942 SC) and
Phenomenology of Perception (1945 PP). Other important
publications include two volumes of political philosophy, Humanism
and Terror (1947 HT) and Adventures of the Dialectic
(1955 AdD), as well as two books of collected essays on art,
philosophy, and politics: Sense and Non-Sense
([1948]1996b/1964) and Signs (1960/1964). Two unfinished
manuscripts appeared posthumously: The Prose of the World
(1969/1973), drafted in 1950–51; and The Visible and the
Invisible (1964 V&I), on which he was working at the time of
his death. Lecture notes and student transcriptions of many of his
courses at the Sorbonne and the Collège de France have also
been published.

For most of his career, Merleau-Ponty focused on the problems of
perception and embodiment as a starting point for clarifying the
relation between the mind and the body, the objective world and the
experienced world, expression in language and art, history, politics,
and nature. Although phenomenology provided the overarching framework
for these investigations, Merleau-Ponty also drew freely on empirical
research in psychology and ethology, anthropology, psychoanalysis,
linguistics, and the arts. His constant points of historical reference
are Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and Marx. The characteristic approach of
Merleau-Ponty’s theoretical work is his effort to identify an
alternative to intellectualism or idealism, on the one hand, and
empiricism or realism, on the other, by critiquing their common
presupposition of a ready-made world and failure to account for the
historical and embodied character of experience. In his later
writings, Merleau-Ponty becomes increasingly critical of the
intellectualist tendencies of the phenomenological method as well,
although with the intention of reforming rather than abandoning it.
The posthumous writings collected in The Visible and the
Invisible aim to clarify the ontological implications of a
phenomenology that would self-critically account for its own
limitations. This leads him to propose concepts such as
“flesh” and “chiasm” that many consider to be
his most fruitful philosophical contributions.

Merleau-Ponty’s thought has continued to inspire contemporary
research beyond the usual intellectual history and interpretive
scholarship, especially in the areas of feminist philosophy,
philosophy of mind and cognitive science, environmental philosophy and
philosophy of nature, political philosophy, philosophy of art,
philosophy of language, and phenomenological ontology. His work has
also been widely influential on researchers outside the discipline of
philosophy proper, especially in anthropology, architecture, the arts,
cognitive science, environmental theory, film studies, linguistics,
literature, and political theory.

Marin Mersenne,0.6836942434310913,0.32832857966423035,"

The Minim friar Marin Mersenne (1588–1648) played a central role
in French intellectual life of the first half of the seventeenth
century. At a time when scientific periodicals were still sorely
lacking, he was rightly referred to as “The Secretary of Learned
Europe” (“le secrétaire de l’Europe
savante”, Hauréau 1877, p. 177) thanks to his
sprawling correspondence, which extended his network across the whole
of learned Europe, to his role as translator, editor, disseminator of
scientific information, and to his ability to generate research and
discoveries by creating “fine questions” (de belles
questions, Pascal 1658, p. 1) addressed to the foremost
scholars of the time. His tireless activity certainly helped to create
a new image of a mathematical, mechanistic and experimental science in
the making, based on the exchange of information and co-operation
between European scholars. Part of his fame is also due to his
lifelong connection to Descartes. From the time the latter settled in
Holland, Mersenne was his main, and at times unique, correspondent,
providing him with rich information on intellectual life, and
relentlessly questioning him on philosophical and scientific
matters.

Although these features of Mersenne’s activities (as an animator
of scientific life and as Descartes’s friend and correspondent)
are the most well-known, they should not conceal Mersenne’s own
original contribution to philosophy. While his first works were
polemic in tone, offering “scientific apologetics”
(Lenoble 1943) using arguments taken from the sciences to defend
Christian catholic religion against all sorts of heterodox trends
threatening it, his latter publications (from 1634 onward), far less
concerned with apologetics, illustrated and promoted the new
mechanical, mathematical, and experimental sciences. A key thread
running through his complex intellectual career, music, understood as
the general science of harmonics, received Mersenne’s constant
attention and was the subject of several important publications.

Metaethics is the attempt to understand the metaphysical,
epistemological, semantic, and psychological, presuppositions and
commitments of moral thought, talk, and practice. As such, it counts
within its domain a broad range of questions and puzzles, including:
Is morality more a matter of taste than truth? Are moral standards
culturally relative? Are there moral facts? If there are moral facts,
what is their origin? How is it that they set an appropriate standard
for our behavior?  How might moral facts be related to other facts
(about psychology, happiness, human conventions…)? And how do
we learn about the moral facts, if there are any?  These questions
lead naturally to puzzles about the meaning of moral claims as well as
about moral truth and the justification of our moral
commitments. Metaethics explores as well the connection between
values, reasons for action, and human motivation, asking how it is
that moral standards might provide us with reasons to do or refrain
from doing as it demands, and it addresses many of the issues commonly
bound up with the nature of freedom and its significance (or not) for
moral
 responsibility.[1]

Metaphor is a poetically or rhetorically ambitious use of words, a
figurative as opposed to literal use. It has attracted more philosophical interest and provoked more philosophical controversy than any of the other traditionally recognized figures of speech.

It is not easy to say what metaphysics is. Ancient and Medieval
philosophers might have said that metaphysics was, like chemistry or
astrology, to be defined by its subject-matter: metaphysics was the
“science” that studied “being as such” or
“the first causes of things” or “things that do not
change”. It is no longer possible to define metaphysics that
way, for two reasons. First, a philosopher who denied the existence of
those things that had once been seen as constituting the
subject-matter of metaphysics—first causes or unchanging
things—would now be considered to be making thereby a
metaphysical assertion. Second, there are many philosophical
problems that are now considered to be metaphysical problems (or at
least partly metaphysical problems) that are in no way related to
first causes or unchanging things—the problem of free will, for
example, or the problem of the mental and the physical.
The first three sections of this entry examine a broad selection of
problems considered to be metaphysical and discuss ways in which the
purview of metaphysics has expanded over time. We shall see that the
central problems of metaphysics were significantly more unified in the
Ancient and Medieval eras. Which raises a question—is there any
common feature that unites the problems of contemporary metaphysics?
The final two sections discuss some recent theories of the nature and
methodology of metaphysics. We will also consider arguments that
metaphysics, however defined, is an impossible enterprise.

Francisco Suárez,0.7180195450782776,0.25737476348876953,"
Francisco Suárez
 (1548–1617)[1] 
was a highly influential philosopher and theologian of the Second
Scholastic (or “Early Modern Scholasticism”), that is, the
revitalized philosophical and theological inquiry of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, conducted within the tradition shaped by Thomas
Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and other medieval scholastics. While
Suárez is commonly praised for his comprehensive, exhaustive,
and systematic exposition of more or less everything known in
philosophy up to his time (certainly, at any rate, in metaphysics),
his achievement in this regard should not be permitted to overshadow
the depth, power, and originality of his own ideas. He worked in a
great variety of fields, including metaphysics, natural theology,
philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, ethics, political
philosophy, and law. In all these areas he made contributions the
influences of which are so widespread and commonplace that they
sometimes escape notice. Still, it is noteworthy that figures as
distinct from one another in place, time, and philosophical
orientation as Leibniz, Grotius, Pufendorf, Schopenhauer, and
Heidegger, all found reason to cite him as a source of inspiration and
influence. Grotius, for instance, praised the Jesuit doctor as a
theologian and philosopher of such depth, breadth, and penetration
that “he hardly had an equal” (Grotius, Letter of 15
October, 1633; 2001: 194).

Methodological Holism in the Social Sciences,0.6635318994522095,0.72078937292099,"

The debate between methodological holists and methodological
individualists concerns the proper focus of explanations in the social
sciences: to what extent should social scientific explanations revolve
around social phenomena and individuals respectively? The discussion
takes two main forms.

The most enduring debate surrounds the issue of dispensability.
Methodological holists engaged in this debate defend the view that
explanations that invoke social phenomena (e.g., institutions, social
structures or cultures) should be offered within the social sciences:
their use is indispensable. Explanations of this sort are variously
referred to as holist, collectivist, social (-level), or macro
(-level) explanations. They are exemplified by claims such as
“the unions protested because the government wanted to lower the
national minimum wage”, or “the rise in unemployment led
to a higher crime rate”. Holist explanations may be contrasted
with explanations that are expressed in terms of individuals, their
actions, beliefs, desires, and the like. The latter are variously
termed individualist, individual (-level), or micro (-level)
explanations. They are illustrated by claims such as “Anna baked
a cake because Susan wanted it”, or 


as a result of individuals a, b, c, etc.
losing their jobs, and feeling very frustrated about having little
money and no job opportunities, the crime rate went up. 


Methodological holists may or may not hold that individualist
explanations should be offered in addition to holist explanations.
Whatever methodological holists’ stand on this issue, they are
opposed by methodological individualists who insist that individualist
explanations alone should be provided within the social sciences, and
thus, that holist explanations should be dispensed with.

The other, more recent dispute between methodological holists and
individualists is concerned with the issue of microfoundations.
Methodological holists involved in this debate defend the view that in
some cases, purely holist explanations (i.e., explanations stated
solely in terms of social phenomena) may stand on their own: they do
not invariably need individual-level microfoundations. A purely holist
explanation might be “the economic depression was the main
reason why the war broke out”. Methodological holists may
maintain that this explanation is fine as it stands; it need not be
supplemented with further details specifying how the economic
depression incited individuals to adopt certain beliefs, act in
certain ways, etc., that in turn led to the outbreak of the war.
Methodological individualists disagree, insisting that such additional
accounts must always be provided.

Within philosophy and the social sciences, whether in the context of
the dispensability or the microfoundations debate, proponents of
methodological holism do not necessarily describe their position in
such terms. In fact, this is seldom so within the social sciences. In
certain cases, some alternative label is used, for example, when
“explanatory holism” and “collectivism” are
employed to denote the view that holist explanations are
indispensable. In other cases, no label at all is attributed to one or
both of the views that are here described as methodologically holist.
In this entry, differences of terminology will be disregarded: the
term “methodological holism” is used to describe both the
thesis that holist explanations are indispensable, as well as the
thesis that purely holist explanations do not always need
individual-level microfoundations.

The methodological individualism—holism debate that concerns the
proper focus of social scientific explanations is just one among
several individualism—holism disputes. Most notably, there are
individualism—holism debates about ontology, confirmation, and
morality. Within these discussions, holism is the view that social
phenomena exist sui generis, or in their own right (the
ontological debate); that social scientific explanations need not
always be confirmed by looking at what happens at the level of
individuals (the debate on confirmation); and that moral
responsibility may sometimes be ascribed to social phenomena such as
groups (one version of the moral debate). It is perfectly possible,
and in fact quite common, to subscribe to methodological holism in the
sense defined in this entry without endorsing these other forms of
holism. Though interesting, these debates will not be directly
addressed here.

The following discussion of methodological holism consists of two
parts. Sections 1 and 2 examine the dispensability debate, and
Sections 3 and 4 consider the microfoundations debate. Both parts
focus on methodological holists’ views—and
arguments—in these disputes. For a characterization of
methodological individualism, see the entry on
 methodological individualism.

Philosophy in Mexico,0.6047413349151611,0.5632237792015076,"

Mexican philosophy has received the influence of different traditions
of thought. These sources have been combined and transformed according
to the specific problems and circumstances of Mexican life. The result
has been a rich and original tradition of thought of over five
centuries that, together with Peruvian philosophy, is the oldest of
the Americas.

Mexican philosophy has been concerned with all sorts of theoretical
questions, however, it could be characterized by its peculiar interest
in ethical and political issues. The theme of the nature of man and of
reason and its connection to the realms of power and domination has
been a central line of thought of Mexican philosophy, from the early
reflections about the justification of the Spanish conquest to the
recent debates about the demands of a democratic reform or the Indian
insurgence in Chiapas. The criticism of philosophical eurocentrism has
been another central feature of Mexican philosophy due to its links to
some of the main political events of Mexican history, such as the
Conquest, the Independence and the Revolution..

Harriet Taylor Mill,0.5465701818466187,0.556115984916687,"

Were I but capable of interpreting to the world one half the

arise from anything that I can write, unprompted and unassisted by her
all but unrivaled wisdom.
—J. S. Mill (1977, 216)



Harriet Taylor Mill (1807–1858) poses a unique set of problems
for an encyclopedist. The usual approach to writing an entry on a
historical figure, namely presenting a straightforward summary of her
major works and then offering a few words of appraisal, cannot be
carried out in her case. This is because she worked in such close
collaboration with John Stuart Mill that it is exceedingly difficult
to disentangle her contributions to the products of their joint effort
from his, and the few pieces that we can declare without fear of
contradiction to have been written primarily by her—some of
which are published, some not—are philosophically slight. In
attempting to assess Taylor Mill’s philosophical career, one
encounters sharply conflicting reports about her intellect from people
who knew her, contradictory evidence about what if any important
philosophical works belong to her corpus as an author, and widely
varying judgments about how much influence she exerted on Mill’s
thought and work.

James Mill,0.48313677310943604,0.6149346828460693,"


James Mill (1773–1836) was a Scots-born political philosopher,
historian, psychologist, educational theorist, economist, and legal,
political and penal reformer. Well-known and highly regarded in his
day, he is now all but forgotten. Mill's reputation now rests
mainly on two biographical facts. The first is that his first-born son
was John Stuart Mill, who became even more eminent than his father. The
second is that the elder Mill was the collaborator and ally of Jeremy
Bentham, whose subsequent reputation also eclipsed the elder Mill's. My
aim here is to try, insofar as possible, to remove Mill from these two
large shadows and to reconsider him as a formidable thinker in his own
right.


Mill's range of interests was remarkably wide, extending from
education and psychology in his two-volume Analysis of the
Phenomena of the Human Mind (1829b), to political economy (he
persuaded his friend David Ricardo to write on that subject, as Mill
himself did in his Elements of Political Economy, 1821), to
penology and prison reform, to the law and history, and, not least, to
political philosophy. On these and other subjects he wrote five
books and more than a thousand essays and reviews. It is with Mill the
political philosopher that the present article is principally
concerned.

John Stuart Mill (1806–73) was the most influential English
language philosopher of the nineteenth century. He was a naturalist, a
utilitarian, and a liberal, whose work explores the consequences of a
thoroughgoing empiricist outlook. In doing so, he sought to combine
the best of eighteenth-century Enlightenment thinking with newly
emerging currents of nineteenth-century Romantic and historical
philosophy. His most important works include System of Logic

An Examination of Sir William Hamilton’s Philosophy

John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) was the most famous and
influential British philosopher of the nineteenth century. He was one
of the last systematic philosophers, making significant contributions
in logic, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and
social theory. He was also an important public figure, articulating the
liberal platform, pressing for various liberal reforms, and serving in
Parliament. During Mill’s lifetime, he was most widely admired for his
work in theoretical philosophy and political economy. However, nowadays
Mill’s greatest philosophical influence is in moral and political
philosophy, especially his articulation and defense of utilitarianism
and liberalism (Nicholson 1998). This entry will examine Mill’s
contributions to the utilitarian and liberal traditions. We will
concentrate on his two most popular and best known works,
Utilitarianism (1861, cited as U) and On
Liberty (1859, cited as OL), drawing on other texts when
this sheds light on his utilitarian and liberal principles. We will
conclude by looking at how Mill applies these principles to issues of
political and sexual equality in Considerations on Representative
Government (1859, cited as CRG), Principles of
Political Economy (1848, cited as PPE), and The
Subjection of Women (1869, cited as SW).

Modularity of Mind,0.8252080678939819,0.4058568775653839,"

The concept of modularity has loomed large in philosophy of psychology
since the early 1980s, following the publication of Fodor’s
landmark book The Modularity of Mind (1983). In the decades
since the term ‘module’ and its cognates first entered the
lexicon of cognitive science, the conceptual and theoretical landscape
in this area has changed dramatically. Especially noteworthy in this
respect has been the development of evolutionary psychology, whose
proponents adopt a less stringent conception of modularity than the
one advanced by Fodor, and who argue that the architecture of the mind
is more pervasively modular than Fodor claimed. Where Fodor (1983,
2000) draws the line of modularity at the relatively low-level systems
underlying perception and language, post-Fodorian theorists such as
Sperber (2002) and Carruthers (2006) contend that the mind is modular
through and through, up to and including the high-level systems
responsible for reasoning, planning, decision making, and the like.
The concept of modularity has also figured in recent debates in
philosophy of science, epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of
language—further evidence of its utility as a tool for
theorizing about mental architecture.

Miracles,0.5771759152412415,0.576865553855896,"


A miracle (from the Latin mirari, to wonder), at a first
and very rough approximation, is an event that is not explicable by
natural causes alone. A reported miracle excites wonder because it
appears to require, as its cause, something beyond the reach of human
action and natural causes. Historically, the appeal to miracles has
formed one of the primary lines of argument in favor of specific forms
of theism, the argument typically being that the event in question can
best (or can only) be explained as the act of a particular deity.

The Epistemology of Modality,0.8001272678375244,0.6172612309455872,"

Whereas facts about what is actual are facts about how things
are, facts about modality (i.e., what is possible, necessary,
or impossible) are facts about how things could, must, or could not
have been. For example, while there are in fact eleven players on a
soccer team, there could have been thirteen, though there
couldn’t have been zero. The first of these is a fact about what
is actual; the second is a fact about what was possible, and the third
is a fact about what is impossible. Humans are often disposed to
consider, make, and evaluate judgments about what is possible and
necessary, such as when we are motivated to make things better and
imagine how things might be. We judge that things could have been
different than they actually are, while other things could not have
been. These modal judgments and modal claims therefore play a central
role in human decision-making and in philosophical argumentation. This
entry is about the justification we have for modal judgments.

Most of the time, we encounter what might be called ordinary
modal judgments, such as the following:

Although I am a philosopher, I could have been a
musician.
Not only does 2 + 2 = 4, it is necessary that 2 + 2 =
4.
Not only is it the case that nothing is red and green all over at
the same time, it is impossible for something to be red and
green all over at the same time.
Although the table is not broken, it could have been
broken.
Even though the cup is on the left side of the table, it
could have been on the right side.


However, philosophers often, in the course of an argument, formulate
what might be called extraordinary modal judgements; these
typically are about some special philosophical concept relevant to the
discussion. Here are some examples:

St. Anselm

Necessarily: God exists.

Descartes

It is possible for the mind to exist without the body.

Berkeley

It is impossible for anything to exist unperceived.

Now a modal argument is one in which either a premise or the
conclusion is an ordinary or an extraordinary modal judgment. Thus, in
modal arguments, we reason about what is necessary, possible, or
impossible, or about what might, must, or could not be the case. Modal
arguments can therefore be found both inside and outside of philosophy
(within philosophy many important philosophical positions are in fact
modal positions). Assuming that a modal argument is valid (i.e., the
premises validly imply the conclusion), then the evaluation of a modal
argument focuses on whether the premises are justified. The question
then arises: how does one show that a modal premise of a modal
argument is justified?

Philosophers have long been interested in how a modal claim can be
known, justified, or understood. The philosophy of modality is the
area in which one studies the metaphysics, semantics, epistemology,
and logic of modal claims—that is, claims about what is
necessary, possible, contingent, essential, and accidental.
Epistemology is the general area of philosophy in which one studies
the nature of knowledge. The central questions of epistemology
concern: (i) what it is to know something, (ii) what it is to be
justified in believing something, (iii) what it is to understand
something, and (iv) what are the means by which we can come to possess
understanding, justification, or knowledge. Within the philosophy of
modality one finds the sub-discipline known as the epistemology of
modality. The central question of this field is:

How can we come to know (be justified in believing or understand)
what is necessary, possible, contingent, essential, and accidental for
the variety of entities and kinds of entities there are?


This is similar to the central questions found in the epistemology of
mathematics and morality, where one inquires into, the nature of
mathematical knowledge or moral knowledge. Special interest in modal
epistemology (another name for the epistemology of modality) often
derives from the following contrast between knowledge of the actual
and knowledge of what could have been and could not have been the
case.

In general, perception of the actual world can guide us to knowledge
of realized possibilities, possibilities that are actual. For
most philosophers hold that given that what is actual is possible,
knowledge of actuality can inform us of knowledge of some
possibilities. However, actuality appears to be an
insufficient guide to what is: (a) merely possible,
since the possibility is not realized, or (b) impossible,
since what is actually the case does not tell us what could not be
the case. To better understand this phenomenon, consider a cup,
\(c\), located at \(L\) at time \(t\). The following line of reasoning
illustrates the central question and its special interest in the case
of ordinary possibilities.

Actual world fact: \(c\) is at \(L\) at \(t\), and \(S\)
perceives that \(c\) is at \(L\) at \(t\).
Knowledge of actuality: \(S\) knows that \(c\) is at \(L\), since
\(S\) perceives \(c\) at \(L\) and there is no reason for \(S\) to
believe that their perception of \(c\) at \(L\) is misguided.
Actuality-to-Possibility Principle: If \(P\) is actually true,
then \(P\) is possibly true, since realized possibilities are evidence
of possibility.
Knowledge of Realized Possibilities: \(S\) can know that it is
possible for \(c\) to be at \(L\) through derivation from the
actuality-to-possibility principle and perception of the actual world
fact.
Non-Actual/Unrealized Possibility Datum: \(c\) could have been at
\(L^*\), a location distinct from \(L\), at \(t\).
\(S\) believes that \(c\) could have been at \(L^*\) at \(t\), and
\(S\) can come to know that \(c\) could have been at \(L^*\) at
\(t\).
Epistemic Question: How does \(S\) know that \(c\) could have been
at \(L^*\) at \(t\)?


With respect to the epistemic question, all of the following have been
proposed as potential answers:

 Perception: even though \(c\) is not at \(L^*\). \(S\)
sees that \(c\) could be at \(L^*\).
Intuition: even though \(c\) is not at \(L^*\), \(S\) has
a non-sensory based intuition that \(c\) could be at \(L^*\) when
\(S\) entertains the question: could \(c\) have been at \(L^*\)?
 Conceivability: \(S\) can conceive of a scenario in
which \(c\) is at \(L^*\). \(S\) derives justification for believing
that \(c\) can be at \(L^*\) from conceiving of it.
 Imaginability: Were \(S\) to imagine a process whereby
\(c\) moved from \(L\) to \(L^*\), \(S\) would not arrive at a
contradiction. So, \(S\) is justified in believing that \(c\) could
have been at \(L^*\) on the basis of imagining the movement.
 Deduction: \(S\) can deduce from knowledge of what \(c\)
is fundamentally and the relevant details about location \(L^*\) that
\(c\) could have been at \(L^*\), since what \(c\) is fundamentally is
not incompatible with it being at \(L^*\).
 Theory: From \(S\)’s knowledge of what \(c\) is,
as well as the relevant facts about the location of \(L^*\), \(S\) can
come to know that \(c\) could have been at \(L^*\).
Similarity: From \(S\)’s prior observation of
objects relevantly similar to \(c\), as well as their actual locations
and movement, \(S\) can come to know that \(c\) could have been at
\(L^*\).


In addition to these theories, one overarching idea is that they can
either be offered as part of a uniformity account or as part of a
non-uniformity account of modal knowledge. The uniformity
view holds that there is only one single route to modal knowledge
at the most fundamental level of explanation. The
non-uniformity view maintains either that different
people can come to know the same modal truth through different routes
or that at the fundamental level of investigation there must be more
than one route to modal knowledge.

In addition to the central question there are three other main
questions of interest.

Modal Sorting:

how can we knowledgeably sort necessary truths from essential truths
and contingent truths? 

At least one point of interest in the sorting question derives from
work in the metaphysics of modality. Necessity and possibility are
interdefinable, \(P\) is necessary when it is not possible that
not-\(P\). However, some such as Fine (1994), have argued that essence
cannot be defined in terms of necessity. This leads us to the
question: how can we sort the essential from the necessary?

Modal Skepticism:

what are the limits of modal knowledge? 

At least one point of interest in the skeptical question derives from
work on the range of modal knowledge. All theories of modal knowledge
should be able to account for ordinary cases. However, some, such as
Van Inwagen (1998), have presented skeptical arguments about extending
modal knowledge to a variety of exotic philosophical claims. 

Modal Architecture/Epistemic Priority:

given that there is a distinction between necessity, possibility, and
essence, is knowledge of one more fundamental than knowledge
of the others? For example is our knowledge of necessity more
fundamental than our knowledge of possibility and essence, and
additionally a pathway to our knowledge of both possibility and
essence? 

At least one point of interest in the architecture/epistemic priority
question derives from work on the proper route to modal knowledge. Bob
Hale (2003) has drawn an important distinction between necessity-first
and possibility-first approaches to modal knowledge. A necessity-first
approach holds that we first arrive at knowledge of necessary truths,
and then derive knowledge of possibility through compatibility with
knowledge of necessity. A possibility-first approach holds that we
first arrive at knowledge of possible truths, and then aim to
determine what necessary truths hold.

It is important to take note of two points about general inquiry in
the epistemology of modality. First, the field is typically concerned
with investigating (i) alethic modality (modality concerned with what
could have been true), as opposed to epistemic modality (modality
concerned with what might be true in an epistemic sense of
“might”) or deontic modality (modality concerned with what
might be done in some normative or evaluative sense). Second, (ii) the
investigation centers on metaphysical modality, as opposed to logical
or physical modality.

For those that accept the reality of metaphysical inquiry,
metaphysical modality is often understood as being the
modality concerned with metaphysics as opposed to logical modality,
which concerns itself with logical relations or physical modality,
which concerns itself with physical relations. In addition, on the
standard model of the relation between these kinds of
modalities the logical possibilities are the most inclusive; they
include any proposition that sheer logic leaves open, no matter how
otherwise impossible it might be. The metaphysical possibilities are
the logical possibilities that are also allowed by the natures of all
of the things that could have existed. The physical possibilities are
the logical and metaphysical possibilities that are also allowed by
the physical laws of nature. On the standard model, the following
nesting relation holds:

Necessary and Sufficient Conditions,0.7789506316184998,0.7775024175643921,"


A handy tool in the search for precise definitions is the
specification of necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the
application of a term, the use of a concept, or the occurrence of some
phenomenon or event. For example, without water and oxygen, there
would be no human life; hence these things are necessary conditions
for the existence of human beings. Cockneys, according to the
traditional definition, are all and only those born within the sound
of the Bow Bells. Hence birth within the specified area is both a
necessary and a sufficient condition for being a Cockney.

 Like other fundamental concepts, the concepts of necessary and
sufficient conditions cannot be readily specified in other terms. This
article shows how elusive the quest is for a definition of the terms
“necessary” and “sufficient”, indicating the
existence of systematic ambiguity in the concepts of necessary and
sufficient conditions.  It also shows the connection between puzzles
over this issue and troublesome issues surrounding the word
“if” and its use in conditional sentences.

Anne is working at her desk. While she is directly aware only of her 
immediate situation — her being seated in front of her 
computer, the music playing in the background, the sound of her 
husband's voice on the phone in the next room, and so on — she 
is quite certain that this situation is only part of a series of 
increasingly more inclusive, albeit less immediate, situations: the 
situation in her house as a whole, the one in her neighborhood, the 
city she lives in, the state, the North American continent, the 
Earth, the solar system, the galaxy, and so on. On the face of it, 
anyway, it seems quite reasonable to believe that this series has a 
limit, that is, that there is a maximally inclusive 
situation encompassing all others: things, as a whole or, 
more succinctly, the actual world. 

Most of us also believe that things, as a whole, needn't have been 
just as they are. Rather, things might have been different in 
countless ways, both trivial and profound. History, from the very 
beginning, could have unfolded quite other than it did in fact: the 
matter constituting a distant star might never have organized well 
enough to give light; species that survived might just as well have 
died off; battles won might have been lost; children born might never
have been conceived and children never conceived might otherwise have
been born. In any case, no matter how things had gone they would 
still have been part of a single, maximally inclusive, 
all-encompassing situation, a single world. Intuitively, then, the 
actual world of which Anne's immediate situation is a part is only 
one among many possible worlds. 

The idea of possible worlds is evocative and appealing. However, 
possible worlds failed to gain any real traction among philosophers 
until the 1960s when they were invoked to provide the conceptual 
underpinnings of some powerful developments in modal logic. Only then
did questions of their nature become a matter of the highest 
philosophical importance. Accordingly, Part 1 of this article
will provide an overview of the role of possible worlds in the 
development of modal logic. Part 2 explores three prominent 
philosophical approaches to the nature of possible 
 worlds.[1] 
Although many of the finer philosophical points of Part 2
do presuppose the technical background of Part 1, the general
philosophical landscape laid out in Part 2 can be appreciated 
independently of Part 1.

Spinoza's Modal Metaphysics,0.6181125044822693,0.35333195328712463,"


Spinoza's views on necessity and possibility, which he claimed were
the “principal basis” of his Ethics (Ep75), have
been less than well received by his readers, to put it mildly. From
Spinoza's contemporaries to our own, readers of the Ethics
have denounced Spinoza's views on modality as metaphysically confused
at best, ethically nihilistic at
 worst.[1]
However, expressing matters this way implies that there is a consensus
about Spinoza's metaphysics of modality and that interpreters differ
only to the extent to which they distance themselves from his
outrageous position. Of course, a cursory reading of certain passages
of the Ethics supports the belief that, if Spinoza is clear
anywhere, it is surely in his views of necessity and contingency. After
all, this is the philosopher who claims that “in nature there is
nothing contingent, but all things have been determined from the
necessity of the divine nature to exist and produce an effect in a
certain way” (EIp29) and that “things could have been
produced by God in no other way, and in no other order than they have
been produced” (EIp33). Passages such as these suggest that
Spinoza was a necessitarian, according to whom falsity and
impossibility are co-extensive. The actual world, we might now say, is
the only possible world. Events could not, in the strongest
sense of that expression, have gone any differently than they in fact
have gone.

And yet, such a picture of the interpretive landscape would be quite
misleading. Spinoza studies have seen a renaissance of interest in his
views on modality, spawning in recent years many articles and chapters
devoted to his modal views. From this boon of research and interest
(relative to Spinoza studies), considerable disagreement has emerged
about Spinoza's modal commitments. Much of this disagreement stems from
larger interpretive disagreements about Spinoza's metaphysics. Hence,
in examining Spinoza's views on modality, we will also explore several
of his most central metaphysical views.

After a brief introduction, this article begins with Spinoza's
views on the distribution of modal properties (2). With respect to
substances (2.1), Spinoza claims that every possible substance
necessarily exists. Spinoza's argument for this conclusion is
part of his larger argument for substance monism—the view that
only one substance exists, God. Spinoza's view about the modal
status of modes, his other main ontological category, is far
more controversial (2.2). Explaining this controversy leads into the
heart of Spinoza's metaphysics, intersecting his views on causation,
inherence, God, ontological plenitude and the principle of sufficient
reason. Although the question of whether Spinoza was a necessitarian is
the predominant topic of discussion in the recent secondary literature
on Spinoza's modal views, Spinoza also sketches interesting
accounts of the nature of modality (3) and the ground of modality (4)
that shed fresh light on his modal commitments. Though understudied by
recent interpreters, these topics were of interest to Spinoza's
peers and remain vibrant research questions in contemporary metaphysics
of modality.

Varieties of Modality,0.8007361888885498,0.6186131238937378,"

Modal statements tell us something about what could be or must be the
case. Such claims can come in many forms. Consider:

No one can be both a bachelor and married. (‘Bachelor’
means ‘unmarried man’.)
You could not have been born of different parents. (Someone born
of different parents wouldn’t be you.)
Nothing can travel faster than light. (It’s a law of nature.)
One cannot get from London to New York in less than one hour.
(Planes that fast haven’t been developed yet.)
You cannot leave the palace. (The doors are locked.)
You cannot promise to come and then stay at home. (It’s just
wrong.)
You cannot start a job application cover letter with “hey
guys”. (It’s just not done.)
You cannot castle if your king is in check. (It’s against the
rules.)
You cannot deduct your holidays from your taxes. (It’s against the
law.)
Fred cannot be the killer. (The evidence shows that he’s
innocent.)


Each of these claims appears to have a true reading. But it also seems
that ‘cannot’ needs to be interpreted in different ways to
make the different sentences true. For one thing, we can, in the same
breath, accept a modal claim in one of the senses illustrated by
(1)–(10) while rejecting it in another one of these senses, as
in the following dialogue:

Caesar:

You’re lucky that I’m still here. The doors were unlocked. I
could have left the palace.

Cleopatra:

True. But then again, you couldn’t have left the palace. That would
have been wrong, given that you promised to meet me here.



Moreover, the modal claims (1)–(10) appear to be true for
completely different reasons. For example, it may be held that the
truth of (1) is due to the meanings of its constituent expressions;
that (2) holds because it lies in your nature to be born of your
actual parents; that (3) is true because the laws of nature preclude
superluminal motion; that (4) holds because of technological
limitations; that (5) owes its truth to the presence of insurmountable
practical obstacles; that (6)–(9) are made true by the demands
of morality, etiquette, the rules of chess, and the law respectively;
and that (10) holds because the known facts prove Fred’s
innocence.

It is one of the tasks of a philosophical theory of modality to give a
systematic and unified account of this multiplicity of modal concepts.
This article discusses a few of the main issues that need to be
addressed by anyone pursuing this goal. Sections 1 and 2 concern the
question of what fundamental categories of modal notions there are.
The focus will be on two contemporary debates: whether there are
separate forms of modality that are tied to the epistemic and the
metaphysical domains (section 1), and whether there is a special kind
of necessity associated with the laws of nature (section 2). Section 3
discusses questions about the relations between different notions of
necessity. Can some of them be reduced to other, more fundamental
ones? If so, which concepts of necessity are the most fundamental
ones? And if there are several fundamental kinds of necessity, what do
they have in common that makes them all kinds of necessity?

Models in Science,0.9113044142723083,0.5650621652603149,"


Models are of central importance in many scientific contexts. The
centrality of models such as the billiard ball model of a gas, the Bohr
model of the atom, the MIT bag model of the nucleon, the Gaussian-chain
model of a polymer, the Lorenz model of the atmosphere, the
Lotka-Volterra model of predator-prey interaction, the double helix
model of DNA, agent-based and evolutionary models in the social
sciences, and general equilibrium models of markets in their respective
domains are cases in point. Scientists spend a great deal of time
building, testing, comparing and revising models, and much journal
space is dedicated to introducing, applying and interpreting these
valuable tools. In short, models are one of the principal instruments
of modern science.


Philosophers are acknowledging the importance of models with
increasing attention and are probing the assorted roles that models
play in scientific practice. The result has been an incredible
proliferation of model-types in the philosophical literature. Probing
models, phenomenological models, computational models, developmental
models, explanatory models, impoverished models, testing models,
idealized models, theoretical models, scale models, heuristic models,
caricature models, didactic models, fantasy models, toy models,
imaginary models, mathematical models, substitute models, iconic
models, formal models, analogue models and instrumental models are but
some of the notions that are used to categorize models. While at first
glance this abundance is overwhelming, it can quickly be brought under
control by recognizing that these notions pertain to different problems
that arise in connection with models. For example, models raise
questions in semantics (what is the representational function that
models perform?), ontology (what kind of things are models?),
epistemology (how do we learn with models?), and, of course, in general
philosophy of science (how do models relate to theory?; what are the
implications of a model based approach to science for the debates over
scientific realism, reductionism, explanation and laws of nature?).

interpretation of any language, formal or natural, by means of

theory of definition) to bear on deep problems of classical

Monism,0.8351058363914491,0.37245169281959534,"


There are many monisms. What they share is that they attribute
oneness. Where they differ is in what they target and
how they count.


This entry focuses on two of the more historically important
monisms: existence monism and priority monism.
Existence monism targets concrete objects and counts by tokens. This is
the doctrine that exactly one concrete object token exists. Priority
monism also targets concrete objects but counts by basic tokens. This
is the doctrine that exactly one concrete object token is basic, and
equivalent to the classical doctrine that the whole is prior to its
(proper) parts.


Neither existence nor priority monism is accorded much respect in
contemporary metaphysics, nor are they always properly distinguished.
Indeed, the tradition associated with these doctrines has long been
dismissed as being somewhere between obscure and ridiculous. But there
are serious arguments for monism. Priority monism may especially
deserve serious reconsideration, of a kind that it is only now
beginning to receive.


Though I will focus on existence monism and priority monism, there
are of course other historically important monisms, including
substance monism. Substance monism targets concrete objects
and counts by highest types. This is the doctrine that all concrete
objects fall under one highest type (perhaps material, or mental, or
some neutral underlying type: here the way divides). This topic is
covered elsewhere in the encyclopedia (Robinson 2011).

Neutral Monism,0.835099458694458,0.3735305964946747,"

Neutral monism is a monistic metaphysics. It holds that ultimate
reality is all of one kind. To this extent neutral monism is in
agreement with the more familiar versions of monism: idealism and
materialism. What distinguishes neutral monism from its monistic
rivals is the claim that the intrinsic nature of ultimate reality is
neither mental nor physical. This negative claim also captures the
idea of neutrality: being intrinsically neither mental nor physical in
nature ultimate reality is said to be neutral between the two.

Neutral monism is compatible with the existence of many neutral
entities. And neutral monism is compatible with the existence of
non-neutral entities—mental and material entities, for
example—assuming that these non-neutral entities are, in some
sense, derivative of the ultimate neutral entities. Most versions of
neutral monism have been pluralist in both these respects. They were
conceived as solutions to the mind-body problem. The goal was to close
the apparent chasm between mental and physical entities by exhibiting
both as consisting of groups of the more basic neutral entities.

Any version of neutral monism will therefore have the answer the
following three questions:

What are the neutral entities and what is their nature?
What is the relationship of these neutral entities to matter?
What is the relationship of these neutral entities to mind?

Montesquieu was one of the great political philosophers of the
Enlightenment. Insatiably curious and mordantly funny, he constructed
a naturalistic account of the various forms of government, and of the
causes that made them what they were and that advanced or constrained
their development. He used this account to explain how governments
might be preserved from corruption. He saw despotism, in particular,
as a standing danger for any government not already despotic, and
argued that it could best be prevented by a system in which different
bodies exercised legislative, executive, and judicial power, and in
which all those bodies were bound by the rule of law. This theory of
the separation of powers had an enormous impact on liberal political
theory, and on the framers of the constitution of the United States of

G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica of 1903 is often considered a
revolutionary work that set a new agenda for 20th-century
ethics. This historical view is, however, overstated. In metaethics
Moore's non-naturalist position was close to that defended by Henry
Sidgwick and other late 19th-century philosophers such as
Hastings Rashdall, Franz Brentano, and J.M.E. McTaggart; in normative
ethics his ideal consequentialism likewise echoed views of Rashdall,
Brentano, and McTaggart. But Principia Ethica presented its
views with unusual vigor and force. In particular, it made much more of
the alleged errors of metaethical naturalism than Sidgwick or Rashdall
had, saying they vitiated most previous moral philosophy. For this
reason, Moore's work had a disproportionate influence on
20th-century moral philosophy and remains the best-known
expression of a general approach to ethics also shared by later
writers such as H.A. Prichard, W.D. Ross, and C.D. Broad.

Moral Particularism and Moral Generalism,0.5433944463729858,0.7030229568481445,"

Among the many questions that arise in the attempt to come to
philosophical grips with morality is what role, if any, moral
principles have to play. Moral generalists think morality is best
understood in terms of moral principles; moral particularists deny
this. To many people, ordinary moral practice seems suffused with
principles (keep your promises; do not steal; do unto others as you
would have them do unto you). To many moral theorists, the central
task of moral theory has been to articulate and defend moral
principles, or, perhaps, a single ultimate moral principle (maximize
impersonal happiness; act only on maxims that can be willed as
universal law). The debate between particularists and generalists thus
has the potential to force a reassessment of both moral theory and
moral practice. 

This characterization of the debate is so far too impressionistic to
provide a tractable framework for philosophical inquiry. The
literature reveals many ways to sharpen the debate, and sharpening is
indeed needed. But both generalism and particularism are best seen as
intellectual traditions in moral philosophy, each of which has a
number of distinct but related strands. This article attempts to
disentangle some of those strands with the most attention being given
to recent stages of this debate.

The arguments for and against both particularism and generalism are
also diverse, arising from metaphysics, epistemology, normative theory
and the philosophy of language. These arguments also interact in
interesting ways with other debates in moral philosophy. Finally, it
is very much an open and interesting question to what extent other
areas of philosophy (e.g., the philosophy of language and
epistemology) can usefully draw on ideas developed in the debate
between moral particularists and moral generalists.

The Definition of Morality,0.5281099081039429,0.6593624949455261,"

The topic of this entry is not—at least directly—moral
theory; rather, it is the definition of morality. Moral
theories are large and complex things; definitions are not. The
question of the definition of morality is the question of identifying
the target of moral theorizing. Identifying this target
enables us to see different moral theories as attempting to capture
the very same thing. In this way, the distinction between a definition
of morality and a moral theory parallels the distinction John Rawls
(1971: 9) drew between the general concept of justice and
various detailed conceptions of it. Rawls’ terminology,
however, suggests a psychological distinction, and also suggests that
many people have conceptions of justice. But the definition/theory
distinction is not psychological, and only moral theorists typically
have moral theories.

There does not seem to be much reason to think that a single
definition of morality will be applicable to all moral discussions.
One reason for this is that “morality” seems to be used in
two distinct broad senses: a descriptive sense and a normative sense.
More particularly, the term “morality” can be used
either

descriptively to refer to certain codes of conduct put forward by
a society or a group (such as a religion), or accepted by an
individual for her own behavior, or
 normatively to refer to a code of conduct that, given specified
conditions, would be put forward by all rational persons.


Which of these two senses of “morality” a theorist is
using plays a crucial, although sometimes unacknowledged, role in the
development of an ethical theory. If one uses “morality”
in its descriptive sense, and therefore uses it to refer to codes of
conduct actually put forward by distinct groups or societies, one will
almost certainly deny that there is a universal morality that applies
to all human beings. The descriptive use of “morality” is
the one used by anthropologists when they report on the morality of
the societies that they study. Recently, some comparative and
evolutionary psychologists (Haidt 2006; Hauser 2006; De Waal 1996)
have taken morality, or a close anticipation of it, to be present
among groups of non-human animals: primarily, but not exclusively,
other primates.

Any definition of “morality” in the descriptive sense will
need to specify which of the codes put forward by a society
or group count as moral. Even in small homogeneous societies that have
no written language, distinctions are sometimes made between morality,
etiquette, law, and religion. And in larger and more complex societies
these distinctions are often sharply marked. So “morality”
cannot be taken to refer to every code of conduct put forward by a
society.

In the normative sense, “morality” refers to a code of
conduct that would be accepted by anyone who meets certain
intellectual and volitional conditions, almost always including the
condition of being rational. That a person meets these conditions is
typically expressed by saying that the person counts as a moral
agent. However, merely showing that a certain code would be
accepted by any moral agent is not enough to show that the code is the
moral code. It might well be that all moral agents would also accept a
code of prudence or rationality, but this would not by itself show
that prudence was part of morality.

As we’ve just seen, not all codes that are put forward by
societies or groups are moral codes in the descriptive sense of
morality, and not all codes that would be accepted by all moral
agents are moral codes in the normative sense of morality. So any
definition of morality—in either sense—will require
further criteria. Still, each of these two very brief descriptions of
codes might be regarded as offering some features of morality that
would be included in any adequate definition. In that way they might
be taken to be offering some definitional features of
morality, in each of its two senses. When one has specified enough
definitional features to allow one to classify all the relevant moral
theories as theories of a common subject, one might then be taken to
have given a definition of morality. This is the sense of
“definition” at work in this entry.

Explicit attempts to define morality are hard to find, at least since
the beginning of the 20th century. One possible explanation
for this is the combined effect of early positivistic worries about
the metaphysical status of normative properties, followed (or
augmented) by Wittgensteinian worries about definitions of any
significant terms whatsoever. Whatever the explanation, when
definitions have been offered, they have tended to be directed at the
notion of moral judgment (Hare 1952, 1981) rather than at morality
itself. To the degree that these definitions are adequate, they might,
without much effort, be converted into definitions of morality in the
descriptive sense. For example, a particular person’s morality
might be regarded as the content of the basic moral judgments that
person is prepared to accept. However, as G. Wallace and A.D.M. Walker
(1970) note, virtually all “definitions” of moral
judgments are only the specification of one definitional feature or
another.

What counts as definitional of morality, in either sense of
“morality”, is controversial. Moreover, the line between
what is part of a definition, in the sense at issue, and what is part
of a moral theory, is not entirely sharp. For example, some might
regard it as definitional of morality, in the normative sense, that it
governs only interpersonal interactions. Others, however, might take
this to be a substantive theoretical claim. Some might take it as
definitional of “morality” in its descriptive sense that
it be a code of conduct that a person or group takes to be most
important. But others might say that attention to religion casts doubt
on this idea.

“Morality”, when used in a descriptive sense, has an
important feature that “morality” in the normative sense
does not have: a feature that stems from its relational nature. This
feature is the following: that if one is not a member of the relevant
society or group, or is not the relevant individual, then accepting a
certain account of the content of morality, in the descriptive sense,
has no implications for how one should behave. On the other hand, if
one accepts a moral theory’s account of moral agents, and the
specifications of the conditions under which all moral agents would
endorse a code of conduct as a moral code, then one accepts that moral
theory’s normative definition of “morality”.
Accepting an account of “morality” in the normative sense
commits one to regarding some behavior as immoral, perhaps even
behavior that one is tempted to perform. Because accepting an account
of “morality” in the normative sense involves this
commitment, it is not surprising that philosophers seriously disagree
about which account to accept.

Moral Motivation,0.5504664182662964,0.673384428024292,"

In our everyday lives, we confront a host of moral issues. Once we
have deliberated and formed judgments about what is right or
wrong, good or bad, these judgments tend to
have a marked hold on us. Although in the end, we do not always behave
as we think we ought, our moral judgments typically motivate us, at
least to some degree, to act in accordance with them. When
philosophers talk about moral motivation, this is the basic phenomenon
that they seek to understand. Moral motivation is an instance of a
more general phenomenon—what we might call normative
motivation—for our other normative judgments also typically
have some motivating force. When we make the normative judgment that
something is good for us, or that we have a reason
to act in a particular way, or that a specific course of action is the
rational course, we also tend to be moved. Many philosophers
have regarded the motivating force of normative judgments as the key
feature that marks them as normative, thereby distinguishing
them from the many other judgments we make. In contrast to our
normative judgments, our mathematical and empirical judgments, for
example, seem to have no intrinsic connection to motivation and
action. The belief that an antibiotic will cure a specific infection
may move an individual to take the antibiotic, if she also believes
that she has the infection, and if she either desires to be cured or
judges that she ought to treat the infection for her own good. All on
its own, however, an empirical belief like this one appears to carry
with it no particular motivational impact; a person can judge that an
antibiotic will most effectively cure a specific infection without
being moved one way or another. 

Although motivating force may be a distinguishing feature of normative
judgments, the phenomenon of normative motivation seems most
significant in the case of narrowly moral judgments. Moral
motivation has, in any case, received far greater attention than
motivation in connection with other normative judgments. Morality is
widely believed to conflict, frequently and sometimes severely, with
what an agent most values or most prefers to do. Perhaps because of
the apparent opposition between self-interest and morality, the fact
of moral motivation has seemed especially puzzling. How is it that we
are so reliably moved by our moral judgments? And what is the precise
nature of the connection between moral judgment and motivation? Of
course, the less puzzling and more mundane moral motivation comes to
seem, the more puzzling failures of moral motivation become.
If we are to explain moral motivation, we will need to understand not
only how moral judgments so regularly succeed in motivating, but how
they can fail to motivate, sometimes rather spectacularly. Not only do
we witness motivational failure among the deranged, dejected, and
confused, but also, it appears, among the fully sound and
self-possessed. What are we to make of the
“amoralist”—the apparently rational, strong willed
individual who seemingly makes moral judgments, while remaining
utterly indifferent? 

In answering the foregoing questions, philosophers have been led to
sharply differing views about moral motivation, and these views have
sometimes been thought to have important implications for foundational
issues in ethics. More precisely, differing views about moral
motivation involve commitment to particular theses which have been
thought to bear on questions about moral semantics and the nature of
morality. Perhaps most famously, certain theses have been jointly
deployed to support skeptical or anti-realist views in
metaethics. This entry provides an overview of the main positions
philosophers have taken in their efforts to understand and explain the
phenomenon of moral motivation. It also briefly explains how key
theses concerning moral motivation have come to inform and structure
debates about moral semantics and the nature of morality.

Moral Naturalism,0.5470481514930725,0.6502214074134827,"


While the term ‘moral naturalism’ has a number of
different meanings, it is most frequently used to describe
naturalistic versions of moral realism. Moral realists hold that there
are objective, mind-independent facts and properties; moral
naturalists hold that these objective, mind-independent moral facts are
natural facts. ‘Moral naturalism’ can also be used as a
label for views in normative ethics which hold that things are good if
they are natural, or as a label for any view in metaethics which is
consistent with a general metaphysical naturalism. But naturalistic
moral realism is the subject of this entry. Moral naturalism appeals
to many, since it combines the advantages of naturalism and realism,
but others have argued that moral naturalism does inadequate justice
to central dimensions of our practice with moral concepts. In this
entry, we examine the most prominent arguments for and against moral
naturalism, and profile three of the most popular and influential
versions of moral naturalism.

Moral Non-Naturalism,0.5504761338233948,0.6529858112335205,"


There may be as much philosophical controversy about how to
distinguish naturalism from non-naturalism as there is about which
view is correct. In spite of this widespread disagreement about the
content of naturalism and non-naturalism there is considerable
agreement about the status of certain historically influential
philosophical accounts as non-naturalist. In particular, there is
widespread agreement that G.E. Moore's account of goodness in
Principia Ethica is a paradigmatically non-naturalist
account. Indeed, if a representative sample of contemporary
philosophers were asked to name a non-naturalist in meta-ethics then
Moore's name almost certainly would predominate.  For better or worse,
Moore's discussion of non-naturalism profoundly shaped 20th
century meta-ethics. Thomas Baldwin was not exaggerating much when he
claimed that, “twentieth century British ethical theory is
unintelligible without reference to Principia Ethica; its
history until 1960 or so being, in brief, that although Moore was
taken to have refuted ‘ethical naturalism’, Moore's own
brand of ‘ethical non-naturalism’ was thought to make
unacceptable metaphysical and epistemological demands; so the only
recourse was to abandon belief in an objective moral reality and
accept an emotivist, prescriptivist or otherwise anti-realist, account
of ethical values.” (Baldwin 1990: 66) More recent defenders of
non-naturalist theories (e.g. Shafer-Landau 2003, Enoch 2011, and
Parfit 2011) often distinguish their accounts from Moore's in a number
of ways, but few if any would dispute that Moore's account is a
paradigmatically non-naturalist one.


Nonetheless, simply characterizing non-naturalism in terms of
Moore's view is not very helpful for at least three reasons. First, we
still need some way of determining which dimensions of similarity to
Moore's views are the relevant ones. This is a standard problem with
trying to understand a genus in terms of a particularly salient species
thereof. Second, Moore defended a variety of theses about goodness in
Principia which have been referred to as forms of
non-naturalism, so we are then left with the question what these views
have in common in virtue of which they are all forms of non-naturalism.
Third, Moore's non-naturalist account of goodness in Principia
is itself unclear in certain crucial respects. Indeed, his later “Reply
to My Critics,” Moore himself admitted that his attempts in
Principia to explain in what sense goodness was a non-natural
property were untenable (Moore 1942: 582). Nonetheless, Moore's account
in Principia is important to bear in mind when trying to
characterize non-naturalism in meta-ethics. For a plausible constraint
on any such characterization is that it not imply that Moore clearly
did not put forward a form of non-naturalism in Principia.
With this constraint in hand, we are in a position to develop a more
general characterization of non-naturalism.


Very roughly, non-naturalism in meta-ethics is the idea that moral
philosophy is fundamentally autonomous from the natural sciences. More
accurately, a family of related but distinct doctrines has gone under
the heading ‘non-naturalism’. In some contexts,
‘non-naturalism’ denotes the semantic thesis that moral
predicates cannot be analyzed in non-normative terms (see Shaver 2000
and Gibbard 2002: 153). In other contexts, ‘non-naturalism’
denotes the epistemological thesis that knowledge of basic moral
principles and value judgements are in some sense self-evident (see
Frankena 1963: 85–86). However, this view (which some self-styled naturalists would actually accept) is more often and more usefully referred to as
‘intuitionism’ and I shall henceforth also refer to it as
such. Most often, ‘non-naturalism’ denotes the
metaphysical thesis that moral properties exist and are not identical
with or reducible to any natural property or properties in some
interesting sense of ‘natural’. However, just which sense
of ‘natural’ is most apt in this context is highly
controversial and I shall return to this point shortly. Understood in
this way, non-naturalism is a form of moral realism and is opposed to
non-cognitivist positions according to which moral utterances serve to
express non-cognitive attitudes rather than beliefs that provide their
truth conditions and is also opposed to error-theoretical positions
according to which there are no moral facts. Moreover, each of these
different conceptions of non-naturalism bears interesting relations of
support to the others. For example, a prima facie plausible explanation
of the alleged immunity of moral predicates from analysis in
non-normative terms (non-naturalism in the first sense) would be that
moral predicates denote non-natural properties (which entails
non-naturalism in the third sense). Perhaps unsurprisingly, Moore
accepted non-naturalism in all three of these senses. Because
non-naturalism is far more often understood in the third of these three
ways I shall henceforth use ‘non-naturalism’ with the third
of these three meanings unless otherwise noted.


It is also sometimes suggested that non-naturalism is the thesis
that moral properties are sui generis and irreducible (see,
e.g. Pigden 1993: 421–422), and indeed this is one of the most
distinctive aspects of Moore's account of goodness. However, this is
not the best way to understand non-naturalism. For intuitively whether
a property is natural is orthogonal to whether it is sui
generis. We should preserve conceptual space for properties that
are natural and irreducible (fundamental properties of physics are
perhaps the least controversial examples, but many would argue that the
fundamental properties of psychology and sociology are also irreducible
but natural) as well as properties that are non-natural but reducible
to other non-natural properties (perhaps rightness is reducible to
goodness or vice versa even if both are non-natural). Indeed, Moore
himself was at one stage a non-naturalist about rightness but
nonetheless thought that rightness was reducible to the property of
being the action with the best outcome, though he later abandoned this
view. Furthermore, a number of self-styled contemporary naturalists
hold that moral properties are both natural and irreducible (Richard
Miller and Nicholas Sturgeon, for example) and we
should try to accommodate this characterization of their view. In
Principia Moore often (though not always – he considers
the example of yellowness) seems to ignore the fact that a property
might be both natural and irreducible.  Undoubtedly this has led to
some confusion in later discussions of naturalism and non-naturalism
(for useful discussion of Moore on this point, see Baldwin 1990:
83–84).


Perhaps the most vexing problem for any general characterization of
non-naturalism is the bewildering array of ways in which the
distinction between natural and non-natural properties has been drawn.
Natural properties have variously been characterized as properties that
(i) are the subject matter of the natural sciences (Moore 1903: 40),
(ii) are invoked in scientific explanations (Little 1994: 226), (iii)
would be identified by the best scientific theory and can be described
in conceptual terms available to a being occupying a non-local point of
view on the world (Crisp 1996: 117), (iv) can be known only a
posteriori (Copp 2002, Moore 1903: 39), (v) can exist by themselves in
time (Moore 1903: 41), (vi) confer causal powers (Lewis 1983), (vii)
figure in the laws of nature (Vallentyne 1998), or (viii) explains
similarity relations (Lewis 1983), e.g. why a black cat is more similar
to a white cat than to a black dog. The first four of these
characterizations are epistemological, and three of those four are cast
explicitly in terms of scientific inquiry; the remaining three are
metaphysical.


Some of these characterizations can be put to one side rather
easily. For example, the thesis that natural properties must be capable
of existing by themselves in time [(v) above] seems to make the very
idea of a natural property deeply problematic. As C.D. Broad argued
(see Broad 1942), it is unclear how the roundness and brownness of a
penny, for example, could exist in time by themselves. In light of this
objection, Moore himself eventually abandoned this way of
characterizing natural properties (Moore 1942: 581–582). Understanding
natural properties as those studied by the natural sciences [(i) above]
threatens to make our characterization of the natural implausibly
dependent on what the actual objects of scientific investigation happen
to be, as if there could not be natural properties our actual
scientific investigation somehow never discovered. It also makes it
unclear why moral philosophy is not one of the sciences (Baldwin 1985:
26). We could try to finesse this point by holding that natural
properties need not actually be the subject matter of the natural
sciences but instead only must be fit for investigation by the natural
sciences but this characterization is simply not very illuminating. For
it cries out for a characterization of what makes something fit for
study by the natural sciences, and that further characterization seems
likely to do all the work in explaining what is involved in a property
being natural.


So we can narrow down the list of candidate ways of characterizing
the natural/non-natural distinction. Still, it would be very difficult
and perhaps impossible to determine just which of the remaining
characterizations of natural properties would provide “the” best way of
characterizing the distinction between naturalism and non-naturalism in
meta-ethics. More likely, there are advantages and disadvantages to
each of the remaining taxonomies on offer. Moreover, which
understanding of the distinction between naturalism and non-naturalism
is the most helpful will vary depending on the context and indeed on
one's more substantive philosophical commitments. I shall therefore not
here undertake the fool's errand of privileging one particular way of
making the distinction between natural and non-natural properties.
Instead I shall simply try to indicate in the discussion of the
arguments for and against non-naturalism where these differences might
matter.

Moral Particularism,0.5434637665748596,0.7046439647674559,"


Moral Particularism, at its most trenchant, is the claim that there
are no defensible moral principles, that moral thought does not consist
in the application of moral principles to cases, and that the morally
perfect person should not be conceived as the person of principle.
There are more cautious versions, however. The strongest defensible
version, perhaps, holds that though there may be some moral principles,
still the rationality of moral thought and judgement in no way depends
on a suitable provision of such things; and the perfectly moral judge
would need far more than a grasp on an appropriate range of principles
and the ability to apply them. Moral principles are at best crutches
that a morally sensitive person would not require, and indeed the use
of such crutches might even lead us into moral error.


The particularist’s opponent is the generalist. Ethical generalism
is the view that the rationality of moral thought and judgement depends
on a suitable provision of moral principles.

This entry provides a high-level introduction. For a more detailed
presentation, see the entry on the debate between

Moral Realism,0.543734610080719,0.6593452095985413,"


Taken at face value, the claim that Nigel has a moral obligation to
keep his promise, like the claim that Nyx is a black cat, purports to
report a fact and is true if things are as the claim purports. Moral
realists are those who think that, in these respects, things should be
taken at face value—moral claims do purport to report facts and
are true if they get the facts right. Moreover, they hold, at least
some moral claims actually are true. That much is the common and more
or less defining ground of moral realism (although some accounts of
moral realism see it as involving additional commitments, say to the
independence of the moral facts from human thought and practice, or to
those facts being objective in some specified way).


As a result, those who reject moral realism are usefully divided
into (i) those who think moral claims do not purport to report facts in
light of which they are true or false (noncognitivists) and (ii) those
who think that moral claims do carry this purport but deny that any
moral claims are actually true (error theorists).


It is worth noting that, while moral realists are united in their
cognitivism and in their rejection of error theories, they disagree
among themselves not only about which moral claims are actually true
but about what it is about the world that makes those claims true.
Moral realism is not a particular substantive moral view nor does it
carry a distinctive metaphysical commitment over and above the
commitment that comes with thinking moral claims can be true or false
and some are true. Still, much of the debate about moral realism
revolves around either what it takes for claims to be true or false at
all (with some arguing that moral claims do not have what it takes) or
what it would take specifically for moral claims to be true (with some
arguing that moral claims would require something the world does not
provide).


The debate between moral realists and anti-realists assumes, though,
that there is a shared object of inquiry—in this case, a range
of claims all involved are willing to recognize as moral
claims—about which two questions can be raised and answered: Do
these claims purport to report facts in light of which they are true
or false? Are some of them true? Moral realists answer
‘yes’ to both, non-cognitivists answer ‘no’ to
the first (and, by default, ‘no’ to the second) while
error theorists answer ‘yes’ to the first and
‘no’ to the second. (With the introduction of
“minimalism” about truth and facts, things become a bit
more complicated. See the section on semantics, below.) To note that
some other, non-moral, claims do not (or do) purport to report facts
or that none (or some) of them are true, is to change the
subject. That said, it is strikingly hard to nail down with any
accuracy just which claims count as moral and so are at issue in the
debate. For the most part, those concerned with whether moral realism
is true are forced to work back and forth between an intuitive grasp
of which claims are at issue and an articulate but controversial
account of what they have in common such that realism either is, or is
not, defensible about them.


By all accounts, moral realism can fairly claim to have common sense
and initial appearances on its side. That advantage, however, might easily
outweighed; there are a number of powerful arguments for
holding that it is a mistake to think of moral claims as true.

Moral Relativism,0.5544216632843018,0.6866468787193298,"
 Moral relativism is an important topic in metaethics. It is also
widely discussed outside philosophy (for example, by political and
religious leaders), and it is controversial among philosophers and
nonphilosophers alike. This is perhaps not surprising in view of
recent evidence that people's intuitions about moral relativism vary
widely. Though many philosophers are quite critical of moral
relativism, there are several contemporary philosophers who defend
forms of it. These include such prominent figures as Gilbert Harman,
Jesse J. Prinz, J. David Velleman and David B. Wong. The term
‘moral relativism’ is understood in a variety of
ways. Most often it is associated with an empirical thesis that there
are deep and widespread moral disagreements and a metaethical thesis
that the truth or justification of moral judgments is not absolute,
but relative to the moral standard of some person or group of
persons. Sometimes ‘moral relativism’ is connected with a
normative position about how we ought to think about or act towards
those with whom we morally disagree, most commonly that we should
tolerate them.

Moral Responsibility,0.5690463781356812,0.7585318088531494,"


When a person performs or fails to perform a morally significant
action, we sometimes think that a particular kind of response is
warranted. Praise and blame are perhaps the most obvious forms this
reaction might take. For example, one who encounters a car accident
may be regarded as worthy of praise for having saved a child from
inside the burning car, or alternatively, one may be regarded as
worthy of blame for not having used one's mobile phone to call
for help. To regard such agents as worthy of one of these reactions is
to regard them as responsible for what they have
done or left undone. (These are examples of other-directed ascriptions
of responsibility. The reaction might also be self-directed, e.g., one
can recognize oneself to be blameworthy). Thus, to be morally
responsible for something, say an action, is to be worthy of a
particular kind of reaction—praise, blame, or something akin
to these—for having performed
 it.[1]



Though further elaboration and qualification of the above
characterization of moral responsibility is called for and will be
provided below, this is enough to distinguish concern about this form
of responsibility from some others commonly referred to through use of
the terms ‘responsibility’ or ‘responsible.’
To illustrate, we might say that higher than normal rainfall in the
spring is responsible for an increase in the amount of vegetation or
that it is the judge's responsibility to give instructions to the jury
before they begin deliberating. In the first case, we mean to identify
a causal connection between the earlier amount of rain and the later
increased vegetation. In the second, we mean to say that when one
assumes the role of judge, certain duties, or obligations, follow.
Although these concepts are connected with the concept of moral
responsibility discussed here, they are not the same, for in neither case are we
directly concerned about whether it would be appropriate to react to
some candidate (here, the rainfall or a particular judge) with
something like praise or
 blame.[2]


Philosophical reflection on moral responsibility has a long history.
One reason for this persistent interest is the way the topic seems
connected with our conception of ourselves as
 ‘persons.’[3] 
Many have held that one distinct feature of persons is their status as morally
responsible agents, a status resting—some have proposed—on a special kind of
control that only they can exercise.  Many who view persons in this way
have wondered whether their special status is threatened if certain
other claims about our universe are true. For example, can a person be
morally responsible for her behavior if that behavior can be explained
solely by reference to physical states of the universe and the laws
governing changes in those physical states, or solely by reference to
the existence of a sovereign God who guides the world along a divinely
ordained path?  Concerns of this sort have often motivated reflection on moral responsibility.


A comprehensive theory of moral responsibility would elucidate the
following: (1) the concept, or idea, of moral responsibility itself;
(2) the criteria for being a moral agent, i.e., one who qualifies
generally as an agent open to responsibility ascriptions (e.g., only
beings possessing the general capacity to evaluate reasons for acting
can be moral agents); (3) the conditions under which the concept of
moral responsibility is properly applied, i.e., those conditions under
which a moral agent is responsible for a particular something (e.g., a
moral agent can be responsible for an action she has performed only if
she performed it freely, where acting freely entails the ability to
have done otherwise at the time of action); and finally 4) possible
objects of responsibility ascriptions (e.g., actions, omissions,
consequences, character traits, etc.). Although each of these will be
touched upon in the discussion below (see, e.g., the brief sketch of
Aristotle's account in the next section), the primary focus of this
entry is on the first component—i.e., the concept of moral
responsibility. The section immediately following this introduction is
a discussion of the origin and history of Western reflection on moral
responsibility. This is followed by an overview of recent work on the
concept of moral responsibility. For further discussion of issues

For moral sentimentalists, our emotions and desires play a leading
role in the anatomy of morality. Some believe moral thoughts are
fundamentally sentimental, others that moral facts make essential
reference to our sentimental responses, or that emotions are the
primary source of moral knowledge. Some believe all these things. The
two main attractions of sentimentalism are making sense of the
practical aspects of morality, on the one hand, and finding a place for
morality within a naturalistic worldview, on the other. The
corresponding challenges are accounting for the apparent objectivity
and normativity of morality. Recent psychological theories emphasizing

versions of moral skepticism deny or doubt moral knowledge, justified

Despite this diversity among the views that get labeled “moral
skepticism”, many people have very strong feelings about moral
skepticism in general. One large group finds moral skepticism obvious,
because they do not see how anyone could have real knowledge of the
moral status of anything or how moral facts could fit into a physical
world. Others see moral skepticism as so absurd that any moral theory
can be refuted merely by showing that it leads to moral
skepticism. Don't you know, they ask, that slavery is morally wrong?
Or terrorism? Or child abuse? Skeptics who deny that we have reason to
believe or obey these moral judgments are seen as misguided and
dangerous. The stridency and ease of these charges suggests mutual

The Grounds of Moral Status,0.5276296138763428,0.7081111669540405,"


An entity has moral status if and only if it or its interests
morally matter to some degree for the entity’s own sake. For instance, an animal may be said to have
moral status if its suffering is at least somewhat morally bad, on
account of this animal itself and regardless of the consequences for
other beings.


At the most general level, there are two ways of understanding moral
status, or what others sometimes call “moral standing” or
“moral considerability.” On the utilitarian approach (see
the entry on the history of utilitarianism),
moral considerability (their preferred term) is a matter of having
one’s interests (e.g., the intensity, duration, etc. of one’s pleasure
or pain) factored into the calculus that determines which action
brings about the greatest utility. On the non-utilitarian approach, to
have moral status is for there to be reasons to act for the sake of
the entity or its interest, reasons which are prior to, and may clash
with, what the calculation of the overall best consequences would
dictate. The non-utilitarian approach is necessarily coupled with two
further ideas: acting unjustifiably against such reasons as well as
failing to give these reasons their proper weight in deliberation is
not only wrong but wrongs the entity and one owes it to the entity to
avoid acting in this way. Note that utilitarians could incorporate
these two ideas by claiming that it is owed to entities with moral
status to properly incorporate their interests into the utilitarian
calculus, and that one wrongs an entity when this is not done. But
these two ideas are inessential to the utilitarian approach.


Some non-utilitarian philosophers allow for the possibility that moral status comes in degrees, and introduce the notion of a highest degree of status: full moral status (FMS). After reviewing which entities have been thought to have moral status and what is involved in having FMS, as opposed to a lesser degree of moral status, this article will survey different views of the grounds of moral status, focusing especially on FMS, as well as the justification for treating these as grounds of moral status.

Henry More,0.6036393046379089,0.30156707763671875,"


Henry More (1614–1687), theologian, and philosopher, is usually
regarded as characteristic of a group of broadly
like-minded thinkers, discerned by historians and designated by them
as the Cambridge Platonists. Certainly, More’s dualistic
theology of body and soul was heavily indebted to Neoplatonic thought,
but the philosophical theology which he developed through the 1650s
and 1660s should be recognised as almost entirely idiosyncratic, even
though, in some respects it was closely paralleled in the philosophy
and theology of his friend and colleague, Ralph Cudworth (1617–1688),
and to a lesser extent in the works of his followers, George Rust
(c.1628–1670) and Joseph Glanvill
(1636–1680). More is notable as a rationalist theologian who
tried to use the details of the mechanical philosophy, as developed by
René Descartes, Robert Boyle and others, to establish the
existence of immaterial substance, or spirit and, therefore, God. In
particular he is known for developing a concept of a Spirit of Nature,
an intermediary between God and the world which was supposedly
required to account for those physical phenomena which could not be
explained by the mechanical philosophy, and a concept of an infinite
absolute space which was also made to represent immaterial reality,

Thomas More,0.5371971726417542,0.2191123366355896,"


Thomas More (1478–1535) was an English lawyer, humanist,
statesman, and Catholic martyr, whose paradoxical life is reflected in
his contrasting titles: he was knighted by King Henry VIII in 1521 and
canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935. Born to an affluent mercantile and
professional family, he was representative of the lively intellectual
culture which had evolved in fifteenth century London and which
provided a platform for the early manifestations of humanism.  More's
outlook was shaped by his legal role in the affairs of the city, then
by far the largest in England with a population of about 50,000, and
it was as a representative of city interests that he was first drawn
into service of the Crown. This involvement with London's civic life
also played its part in the conception of Utopia, his best
known work, completed in 1516. His friendship with the Dutch scholar
Desiderius Erasmus lasted over thirty years and was crucial to the
development of his own ideas on literary studies, in particular the
revival of Greek, and on the social possibilities of education. It was
thanks to Erasmus that he was drawn into the literary networks of
Northern humanism. While More cannot be classified in any formal sense
as a philosopher, it is in his writings in defence of humanism and in
Utopia that he can best be seen as an exponent of ideas. In
the early years of their association More and Erasmus shared a
critical interest in exposing the follies and abuses of contemporary
life, not least in matters of religious practice; but once More was
drawn into the savage polemics of the early Reformation he defended
Catholic orthodoxy with all the weapons at his disposal.  However, his
efforts were compromised by a shift in government policy.  His
conscientious refusal to support King Henry's campaign to repudiate
his marriage to Katherine of Aragon led to his retirement from public
life and, ultimately, to imprisonment. During fourteen months in the
Tower he wrote a number of devotional works which are in contrast to
the severity of his polemical writings. Tried for treason, More was
beheaded on 6 July 1535. His death caused widespread indignation on
the Continent, where he was initially seen as a model of integrity, a
Seneca-like counsellor who resisted a tyrannical ruler.  His status as
a Catholic martyr emerged later under the influence of the English
Counter-Reformation.

Mulla Sadra,0.6033236980438232,0.1100778952240944,"


Sadr al-Din Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. Yahya Qawami Shirazi (ca.
1571–1636) is arguably the most significant Islamic philosopher
after Avicenna. Best known as Mulla Sadra, he was later given the
title of Sadr al-Muta’allihin (Master of the theosists) for his
approach to philosophy that combined an interest in theology and drew
upon insights from mystical intuition. He championed a radical
philosophical method that attempted to transcend the simple dichotomy
between a discursive, ratiocinative mode of reasoning and knowing, and
a more intuitive, poetic and non-propositional mode of knowledge. He
became famous as the thinker who revolutionized the doctrine of
existence in Islamic metaphysics and extended the shift from an
Aristotelian substance metaphysics to a (Neoplatonic) process
metaphysics of change, from a metaphysics grounded in the primacy of
substances as the stuff of existence to a metaphysics founded upon and
moved by acts of being. A keen thinker who wrote works in philosophy,
theology, mysticism, and scriptural exegesis, he attempted a
wide-ranging synthesis of approaches to Islamic thought and argued for
the necessity of the method of understanding reality through a mixture
of logical reasoning, spiritual inspiration, and a deep meditation
upon the key scriptural sources of the Twelver Shi‘i tradition
in Islam. A key figure of a group of thinkers whom Nasr and Corbin
referred to as the “School of Isfahan”, he played a major
role in intellectual life during the revitalization of philosophy
under the Safavid Shah ‘Abbas I
(r. 996–1038 AH/1588–1629 CE) and later on in life was the most
important teacher at the philosophical seminary known as Madrasa-yi
Khan in his hometown of Shiraz.

Multiculturalism,0.4400887489318848,0.6550134420394897,"

The idea of multiculturalism in contemporary political discourse and
in political philosophy is about how to understand and respond to the
challenges associated with cultural and religious diversity. The term
“multicultural” is often used as a descriptive term to
characterize the fact of diversity in a society, but in what follows,
the focus is on its prescriptive use in the context of Western liberal
democratic societies. While the term has come to encompass a variety
of prescriptive claims, it is fair to say that proponents of
multiculturalism reject the ideal of the “melting pot” in
which members of minority groups are expected to assimilate into the
dominant culture in favor of an ideal in which members of minority
groups can maintain their distinctive collective identities and
practices. In the case of immigrants, proponents emphasize that
multiculturalism is compatible with, not opposed to, the integration
of immigrants into society; multiculturalism policies provide fairer
terms of integration for immigrants.

Modern states are organized around the language and cultural norms of
the dominant groups that have historically constituted them. Members
of minority cultural groups face barriers in pursuing their social
practices in ways that members of dominant groups do not. Some
theorists argue for tolerating minority groups by leaving them free of
state interference (Kukathas 1995, 2003). Others argue that mere
toleration of group differences falls short of treating members of
minority groups as equals; what is required is recognition and
positive accommodation of minority group practices through what the
leading theorist of multiculturalism Will Kymlicka has called
“group-differentiated rights” (1995). Some
group-differentiated rights are held by individual members of minority
groups, as in the case of individuals who are granted exemptions from
generally applicable laws in virtue of their religious beliefs or
individuals who seek language accommodations in education and in
voting. Other group-differentiated rights are held by the group qua
group rather by its members severally; such rights are properly called
“group rights,” as in the case of indigenous groups and
minority nations, who claim the right of self-determination. In the
latter respect, multiculturalism is closely allied with
nationalism.

Multiculturalism has been used as an umbrella term to characterize the
moral and political claims of a wide range of marginalized groups,
including African Americans, women, LGBT people, and people with disabilities
(Glazer 1997, Hollinger 1995, Taylor 1992). This is true of the
debates in the 1980s over whether and how to diversify school
curricula to recognize the achievements of historically marginalized
groups. Contemporary theories of multiculturalism, which originated in
the late 1980s and early 1990s, tend to focus their arguments on
immigrants who are ethnic and religious minorities (e.g. Latinos in
the U.S., Muslims in Western Europe), minority nations (e.g. Catalans,
Basque, Welsh, Québécois), and indigenous peoples (e.g.
Native peoples in North America, Australia, and New Zealand). As we
shall see, the variety of prescriptive claims go beyond the issue of
representation in school curricula.

Multiple Realizability,0.8220855593681335,0.4685048758983612,"


In the philosophy of mind, the multiple realizability thesis
contends that a single mental kind (property, state, event) can be
realized by many distinct physical kinds. A common example is pain.
Many philosophers have asserted that a wide variety of physical
properties, states, or events, sharing no features in common at that
level of description, can all realize the same pain. This thesis served
as a premise in the most influential argument against early theories
that identified mental states with brain states (psychoneural identity
theories). It also served in early arguments for functionalism.
Nonreductive physicalists later adopted it (usually without alteration)
to challenge all varieties of psychophysical reductionism. The argument
has even been employed to challenge the functionalism it initially
motivated.


Reductionists have offered numerous responses. Initial responses
either attacked the argument from the multiple realizability premise to
the anti-reduction/identity theory conclusion or proposed revisions to
classical reductionism that accommodated the premise. More recently,
some reductionists have questioned the truth of the multiple
realizability premise itself.

The Philosophy of Music,0.5921421051025391,0.5123474597930908,"

Philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions about the
nature and value of music and our experience of it. Like any
“philosophy of X”, it presupposes knowledge of its target.
However, unlike philosophy of science, say, the target of philosophy
of music is a practice most people have a significant background in,
merely as a result of being members of a musical culture. Music plays
a central role in many people’s lives. Thus, as with the central
questions of metaphysics and epistemology, not only can most people
quickly grasp the philosophical questions music raises, they tend to
have thought about some of those questions before encountering the
academic discipline itself. (This is as good a place as any to note
that I, like most in the English-speaking philosophical world, focus
exclusively on Western musical traditions. For criticism of this
tendency, see Alperson 2009. For some exceptions to it, see S. Davies
2001: 254–94) and Feagin 2007.)

Music is perhaps the art that presents the most philosophical puzzles.
Unlike painting, its works often have multiple instances, none of
which can be identified with the work itself. Thus, the question of
what exactly the work is is initially more puzzling than the
same question about works of painting, which appear (at least
initially) to be ordinary physical objects. Unlike much literature,
the instances of a work are performances, which offer interpretations
of the work, yet the work can also be interpreted (perhaps in a
different sense) independently of any performance, and performances
themselves can be interpreted. This talk of
“interpretation” points to the fact that we find music an
art steeped with meaning, and yet, unlike drama, pure instrumental
music has no obvious semantic content. This quickly raises the
question of why we should find music so valuable. Central to many
philosophers’ thinking on these subjects has been music’s
apparent ability to express emotions while remaining an abstract art
in some sense.

This entry focuses almost exclusively on work in the philosophy of
music that is recent—from within the last fifty years—and
in an analytic vein (broadly construed). For a much broader
introduction to philosophy of music, covering its history, major
figures, connections with other disciplines, and a wider range of
topics, see Gracyk & Kania 2011. Useful single-author overviews

Mysticism,0.6864446401596069,0.4577788710594177,"


Under the influence of William James’ The Varieties of Religious
Experience, philosophical interest in mysticism has been heavy in
distinctive, allegedly knowledge-granting “mystical
experiences.” Philosophers have focused on such topics as the
classification of mystical experiences, their nature in different
religions and mystical traditions, to what extent mystical experiences
are conditioned by a mystic’s language and culture, and whether
mystical experiences furnish evidence for the truth of their
contents. Some philosophers have questioned the emphasis on experience
in favor of examining the entire mystical complex (See Jantzen, 1994
and 1995, and section 9 below, and Turner, 1996). Sarah Coakley has
argued for replacing the datum for investigation from individual
experiential episodes to ongoing contemplative practices. (Coakley
2009, and see Section 9).  Typically, mystics, theistic or not, see
their mystical experience as part of a larger undertaking aimed at
human transformation (See, for example, Teresa of Avila,
Life, Chapter 19) and not as the terminus of their
efforts. ‘Mysticism’ is best thought of as a constellation
of distinctive practices, discourses, texts, institutions, traditions,
and experiences aimed at human transformation, variously defined. This
entry reports on mysticism and philosophy so will concentrate chiefly
on the topics philosophers have discussed concerning mystical
experience.

Plato's Myths,0.5436780452728271,0.2700357735157013,"


What the ancient Greeks—at least in the archaic phase of their
civilization—called muthos was quite different from what
we and the media nowadays call “myth”. For them a
muthos was a true story, a story that unveils the true origin
of the world and human beings. For us a myth is something to be
“debunked”: a widespread, popular belief that is in fact
false. In archaic Greece the memorable was transmitted orally through
poetry, which often relied on myth. However, starting with the
beginning of the seventh century BC two types of discourse emerged
that were set in opposition to poetry: history (as shaped by, most
notably, Thucydides) and philosophy (as shaped by the peri
phuseōs tradition of the sixth and fifth centuries
BC). These two types of discourse were naturalistic alternatives to
the poetic accounts of things. Plato broke to some extent from the
philosophical tradition of the sixth and fifth centuries in that he
uses both traditional myths and myths he invents and gives them some
role to play in his philosophical endeavor. He thus seems to attempt
to overcome the traditional opposition between muthos
and logos.


There are many myths in Plato’s dialogues: traditional myths, which he
sometimes modifies, as well as myths that he invents, although many of
these contain mythical elements from various traditions. Plato is both
a myth teller and a myth maker. In general, he uses myth to inculcate
in his less philosophical readers noble beliefs and/or teach them
various philosophical matters that may be too difficult for them to
follow if expounded in a blunt, philosophical discourse. More and more
scholars have argued in recent years that in Plato myth and philosophy
are tightly bound together, in spite of his occasional claim that they
are opposed modes of discourse.

central notion of “emptiness”

Buddhism to Tibet, China, Japan and other Asian countries the writings

Nationalism,0.43277853727340704,0.6572781205177307,"
The term “nationalism” is generally used to describe
two phenomena: (1) the attitude that the members of a nation have when
they care about their national identity, and (2) the actions that the
members of a nation take when seeking to achieve (or sustain)
self-determination.  (1) raises questions about the concept of a
nation (or national identity), which is often defined in terms of
common origin, ethnicity, or cultural ties, and specifically about
whether an individual's membership in a nation should be regarded as
non-voluntary or voluntary.  (2) raises questions about whether
self-determination must be understood as involving having full
statehood with complete authority over domestic and international
affairs, or whether something less is required.
It is traditional, therefore, to distinguish nations from states
— whereas a nation often consists of an ethnic or cultural
community, a state is a political entity with a high degree of
sovereignty. While many states are nations in some sense, there are
many nations which are not fully sovereign states. As an example, the
Native American Iroquois constitute a nation but not a state, since
they do not possess the requisite political authority over their
internal or external affairs.  If the members of the Iroquois nation
were to strive to form a sovereign state in the effort to preserve
their identity as a people, they would be exhibiting a state-focused
nationalism.
Nationalism has long been ignored as a topic in political
philosophy, written off as a relic from bygone times. It came into the
focus of philosophical debate two decades ago, in the nineties, partly
in consequence of rather spectacular and troubling nationalist clashes
such as those in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet
republics. Surges of nationalism tend to present a morally ambiguous,
and for this reason often fascinating, picture.  “National
awakening” and struggles for political independence are often
both heroic and cruel; the formation of a recognizably national state
often responds to deep popular sentiment but sometimes yields inhuman
consequences, from violent expulsion and “cleansing” of
non-nationals to organized mass murder. The moral debate on
nationalism reflects a deep moral tension between solidarity with
oppressed national groups on the one hand and repulsion in the face of
crimes perpetrated in the name of nationalism on the other. Moreover,
the issue of nationalism points to a wider domain of problems related
to the treatment of ethnic and cultural differences within democratic
polity, arguably among the most pressing problems of contemporary
political theory.
In the last decade the focus of the debate about nationalism has
shifted towards issues in international justice, probably in response
to changes on the international scene: bloody nationalist wars such as
those in the former Yugoslavia have become less conspicuous, whereas
the issues of terrorism, of the “clash of civilizations”
and of hegemony in the international order have come to occupy public
attention. One important link with earlier debates is provided by the
contrast between views of international justice based on the
predominance of sovereign nation-states and more cosmopolitan views
that insist upon limiting national sovereignty or even
envisage its disappearance. Another new focus for philosophers is
provided by issues of territory and territorial rights, which connect
the topic of nation-states (or, “the nation state”) with
questions about boundaries, migration, resource rights and vital
ecological matters.
In this entry we shall first present conceptual issues of
definition and classification (Sections 1 and 2) and then the
arguments put forward in the debate (Section 3), dedicating more space
to the arguments in favor of nationalism than to those against it, in
order to give the philosophical nationalist a proper hearing.

Paul Natorp,0.6419733762741089,0.4885433316230774,"

Paul Gerhard Natorp was one of the most prominent philosophers in
Germany at the turn of the last century. Born in Düsseldorf on
January 24, 1854, he began his university education at Bonn in
classical philology under Hermann Usener, and continued at the
University of Strassburg, but as he neared completion of his studies,
he found himself unsatisfied with his work, and vexed by “a
secret philosophical urge” (Natorp 1921f: 152–153; all
translations by the author). It found its outlet when a friend
studying at Marburg wrote to him of Hermann Cohen and F.A. Lange, and
of their interpretation of Kant; thenceforth Natorp “placed his
whole thinking and his entire, powerful capacity for work in the
service of this single task:” the development of
“philosophy as science” (Cassirer 1925: 276). His first
philosophy teacher was Ernst Laas, whose anti-Kantian and
anti-Platonic positivism incited Natorp to deeper engagement with the
philosophy of critique (Natorp 1921f: 153). In this way, his early
philosophical studies converged with his original love of philology as
he pursued the “prehistory” of Kantian critique in
Descartes, Galileo, and Copernicus, back to Plato (Natorp 1921f: 154).
Natorp completed his Habilitation under Cohen at Marburg in
1881, and taught there until his death on August 17, 1924.

During his long and prolific tenure at Marburg, Natorp came into
contact with a number of illustrious scholars and writers. Boris
Pasternak, Karl Barth, and Ernst Cassirer were among his students;
Rabindranath Tagore was his friend. In the fateful summer of 1914 the
young T.S. Eliot caricatured Natorp, the director of the summer
program in which he was enrolled
 [image available online].
 In addition to Cohen, academic colleagues included the philosopher
Nicolai Hartmann, the theologians Rudolf Bultmann and Rudolf Otto, and
the literary scholar Ernst Robert Curtius. Late in life, Natorp
directed Hans-Georg Gadamer’s doctoral dissertation (Gadamer
1922), and, together with his long-time philosophical interlocutor,
Edmund Husserl of Freiburg, engineered Martin Heidegger’s
appointment as an Extraordinarius at Marburg in 1923. Upon
Natorp’s death the following summer (see Heidegger 1992),
Heidegger assumed his chair, thus bringing the department’s
Kantian orientation to a decisive close. 

Like his younger contemporary, Ernst Cassirer, Natorp initially
focused on the explication, defense, and elaboration of Cohen’s
difficult and often impenetrable work on Kant-interpretation, the
theory of science, and the history of
 philosophy.[1]
 While Natorp published important works of contemporary systematic
philosophy (1887, 1888h), he devoted much of his attention in the last
decades of the nineteenth century to filling out historical elements
in Cohen’s larger framework. He especially employed his
expertise in Greek thought to work out ancient anticipations of
“critical” scientific philosophy, and analyze its natural
development. Later, in the chaotic social, political, and cultural
landscape of pre- and interwar Germany, and especially in the wake of
Cohen’s death in 1918, Natorp departed from the classic Marburg
concentration on the logic of the exact sciences. This departure was
less a shift in his basic philosophical outlook than the sounding of
new themes, some native to the Marburg School, others arising out of
dialogue with other philosophers. Motivated by the liberal-socialist
 ideals[2]
 integral to the global theory of culture that was the
Marburgers’ ultimate
 aim,[3]
 Natorp wrote widely on ethics, politics, and
 Sozialpädagogik.[4]
 On the other hand, one must also interpret Natorp’s later
thought (esp. his “ontological turn”; von Wolzogen, 1988; Brach 1996) in light of his
dialogue with other philosophies challenging neo-Kantianism’s
dominance in the German academy, notably the so-called
Lebensphilosophie, and the phenomenologies of Husserl and
 Heidegger.[5]

Naturalism,0.7760471105575562,0.4893886148929596,"
The term “naturalism” has no very precise meaning in
contemporary philosophy. Its current usage derives from debates in
America in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed
“naturalists” from that period included John Dewey, Ernest
Nagel, Sidney Hook and Roy Wood Sellars. These philosophers aimed to
ally philosophy more closely with science. They urged that reality is
exhausted by nature, containing nothing “supernatural”,
and that the scientific method should be used to investigate all areas
of reality, including the “human spirit” (Krikorian 1944;
Kim 2003).
So understood, “naturalism” is not a particularly
informative term as applied to contemporary philosophers. The great
majority of contemporary philosophers would happily accept naturalism
as just characterized—that is, they would both reject
“supernatural” entities, and allow that science is a
possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths
about the “human spirit”.
Even so, this entry will not aim to pin down any more informative
definition of “naturalism”. It would be fruitless to try
to adjudicate some official way of understanding the term. Different
contemporary philosophers interpret “naturalism”
differently. This disagreement about usage is no accident. For better
or worse, “naturalism” is widely viewed as a positive
term in philosophical circles—few active philosophers nowadays
are happy to announce themselves as
“non-naturalists”.[1]
 This inevitably leads to a divergence in
understanding the requirements of “naturalism”. Those
philosophers with relatively weak naturalist commitments are inclined
to understand “naturalism” in a unrestrictive way, in
order not to disqualify themselves as “naturalists”,
while those who uphold stronger naturalist doctrines are happy to set
the bar for “naturalism”
higher.[2]
Rather than getting bogged down in an essentially definitional
issue, this entry will adopt a different strategy. It will outline a
range of philosophical commitments of a generally naturalist stamp,
and comment on their philosophical cogency. The primary focus will be
on whether these commitments should be upheld, rather than on whether
they are definitive of “naturalism”. The important thing
is to articulate and assess the reasoning that has led philosophers in
a generally naturalist direction, not to stipulate how far you need to
travel along this path before you can count yourself as a paid-up
“naturalist”.
As indicated by the above characterization of the
mid-twentieth-century American movement, naturalism can be separated
into an ontological and a methodological component. The ontological
component is concerned with the contents of reality, asserting that
reality has no place for “supernatural” or other
“spooky” kinds of entity. By contrast, the methodological
component is concerned with ways of investigating reality, and
claims some kind of general authority for the scientific method.
Correspondingly, this entry will have two main sections, the first
devoted to ontological naturalism, the second to methodological
naturalism.
Of course, naturalist commitments of both ontological and
methodological kinds can be significant in areas other than
philosophy.  The modern history of psychology, biology, social science
and even physics itself can usefully be seen as hinging on changing
attitudes to naturalist ontological principles and naturalist
methodological precepts. This entry, however, will be concerned solely
with naturalist doctrines that are specific to philosophy. So the
first part of this entry, on ontological naturalism, will be concerned
specifically with views about the general contents of reality that are
motivated by philosophical argument and analysis. And the second part,
on methodological naturalism, will focus specifically on
methodological debates that bear on philosophical practice, and in
particular on the relationship between philosophy and science.

Naturalism in Legal Philosophy,0.44304507970809937,0.8239099383354187,"

The “naturalistic turn” that has swept so many areas of
philosophy over the past four decades has also had an impact in the in
legal philosophy. Methodological naturalists (M-naturalists) view
philosophy as continuous with empirical inquiry in the sciences. Some
M-naturalists want to replace conceptual and justificatory
theories with empirical and descriptive theories; they take their
inspiration from more-or-less Quinean arguments against conceptual
analysis and foundationalist programs. Other M-naturalists retain the
normative and regulative ambitions of traditional philosophy,
but emphasize that it is an empirical question what normative
advice is actually useable and effective for creatures like us. Some
M-naturalists are also substantive naturalists
(S-naturalists). Ontological S-naturalism is the view that there exist
only natural or physical things; semantic
S-naturalism is the view that a suitable philosophical analysis of any
concept must show it to be amenable to empirical inquiry. Each of
these varieties of naturalism has applications in legal philosophy.
Replacement forms of M-naturalism hold that: (1) conceptual
analysis of the concept of law should be replaced by reliance on the
best social scientific explanations of legal phenomena, and (2)
normative theories of adjudication should be replaced by empirical
theories. These views are associated with American Legal Realism and
Brian Leiter’s reinterpretation of Realism. Normative
M-naturalists, by contrast, inspired and led by Alvin Goldman, seek to
bring empirical results to bear on philosophical and foundational
questions about adjudication, the legal rules of evidence and
discovery, the adversarial process, and so forth. Within legal
philosophy, S-naturalism has featured most prominently in the writings
of the Scandinavian Legal Realists (long predating the resurgence of
naturalism in Anglophone jurisprudence), whose Ontological
S-naturalism led them to employ a familiar range of
naturalism-motivated explanatory strategies, including naturalistic
reduction of legal concepts and non-cognitivist accounts of important
aspects of legal discourse. S-naturalism also can serve, and sometimes
has served, as a motivation for Legal Positivism in the Anglo-American
jurisprudential tradition. More recent forms of S-naturalism,
associated with a revival of a kind of natural law theory defended by
David Brink and Michael Moore (among others), applies the
“new” or “causal” theory of reference to
questions of legal interpretation, including the interpretation of
moral concepts as they figure in legal rules.

Natural Kinds,0.8062561154365541,0.5167106986045837,"


Scientific disciplines frequently divide the particulars they study
into kinds and theorize about those kinds. To say that a kind
is natural is to say that it corresponds to a grouping that
reflects the structure of the natural world rather than the interests
and actions of human beings. We tend to assume that science is often
successful in revealing these kinds; it is a corollary of scientific
realism that when all goes well the classifications and taxonomies
employed by science correspond to the real kinds in nature. The
existence of these real and independent kinds of things is held to
justify our scientific inferences and practices.


Putative examples of kinds may be found in all scientific disciplines.
Chemistry provides what are taken by many to be the paradigm examples
of kinds, the chemical elements, while chemical compounds, such as
H2O, are also natural kinds of stuff. (Instances of a
natural kind may be man-made, such as artificially synthesized
ascorbic acid, i.e., vitamin C; but whether chemical kinds all of
whose instances are artificial are natural kinds is open to debate.
The synthetic transuranium elements, e.g. Rutherfordium, seem good
candidates for natural kinds, whereas artificial chemical kinds, such
as the entirely synthetic compound bismuth germanate,
Bi4Ge3OO12, which is used in particle
detectors, are, arguably, less obviously natural kinds.) The standard
model in quantum physics reveals many kinds of fundamental particles
(electron, tau neutrino, charm quark), plus broader categories such as
kinds of kind (lepton, quark) and higher kinds (fermion,
boson). Astronomy classifies the heavenly bodies: galaxies, for
example, can be either elliptical, lenticular, or spiral.


Since kinds are revealed by science, a science can revise which kinds
it holds exist: phlogisticated air was regarded as a kind until after
Lavoisier's chemical revolution. A science can even question a whole
category of kinds. Before being superseded in this regard by the
chemical elements, biological species were taken to be the best
exemplars of kindhood. Yet now it is somewhat controversial to state
that species are natural kinds.  As the world changes, its kinds may
change too.  Rapidly mutating micro-organisms demand new
classification systems.  Kinds in the social sciences, such as
economics or sociology, are even more problematic, since the changing
norms and practices of individuals and societies may also be held to
be constitutive factors in kind membership, and these norms and
practices may themselves respond to our classification of people into
kinds. These examples are troublesome because there is
some tension between the existence of kinds and the mutability of the
particulars which are supposed to fall under those kinds. In the case
of atoms or galaxies, the particulars under study are typically
long-lived and only slowly changing; viruses and economic structures,
on the other hand, are more dynamic.


This article divides philosophical discussions of natural kinds into
three areas: metaphysics, philosophy of science, and philosophy of
language. The metaphysics of natural kinds asks whether we should
think of our supposed natural kinds as genuinely natural.  And if they
are, what are natural kinds?  And, finally, do natural kinds
have essences?  Philosophy of science is concerned with natural kinds
because, as mentioned above, it is the use of natural kinds by the
individual (‘special’) sciences that generates our interest in them.
So we may ask, whether the kinds appearing in our best scientific
theories do indeed satisfy the theories of natural kinds proposed by
the metaphysicians.  Philosophy of language takes an interest in
natural kinds because basic issues are raised by the semantics of
natural kind terms.  For example, if we think of naming an entity and
describing it as, semantically speaking, fundamentally different ways
of talking about it, should we think of natural kind terms as
functioning like names or like descriptions?

Natural Philosophy in the Renaissance,0.5814692378044128,0.23304036259651184,"
Natural philosophy, as distinguished from metaphysics and
mathematics, is traditionally understood to encompass a wide range of
subjects which Aristotle included in the physical sciences. According
to this classification, natural philosophy is the science of those
beings which undergo change and are independent of human beings. This
vast field of inquiry was described in Aristotelian treatises such
as Physics, On the Heavens, On Generation and Corruption,
Meteorology, History of Animals, On the Parts of Animals, On the
Generation of Animals, On the Soul (whose Renaissance reception
is not discussed in the present entry); the so-called parva
naturalia (other minor writings); and some apocrypha
(e.g., the Problemata), which were taught in the universities
in the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance. During the Renaissance,
despite the enduring centrality of the Aristotelian paradigm for the
discipline, natural philosophy was enriched and expanded by a number
of further approaches. By the end of the sixteenth century natural
philosophy was no longer purely identified with the Aristotelian
system or a standard university curriculum. At the same time, the
proliferation of new contexts and ways of learning did not
automatically eliminate older ones, and this fusion contributed to the
birth of modern science in a period of religious and political
upheaval.

Natural Selection,0.9927790760993958,0.5638753771781921,"


Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection provided the
first, and only, causal-mechanistic account of the existence of
adaptations in nature. As such, it provided the first, and only,
scientific alternative to the “argument from design”.
That alone would account for its philosophical significance. But the
theory also raises other philosophical questions not encountered in
the study of the theories of physics. Unfortunately the concept of
natural selection is intimately intertwined with the other basic
concepts of evolutionary theory—such as the concepts of fitness
and adaptation—that are themselves philosophically
controversial. Fortunately we can make considerable headway in getting
clear on natural selection without solving all of those outstanding
problems.

The Nature of Law,0.4385694563388825,0.8158805966377258,"


Lawyers are typically interested in the question: What is the
law on a particular issue? This is always a local question and
answers to it are bound to differ according to the specific
jurisdiction in which they are asked. In contrast, philosophy of law
is interested in the general question: What is Law? This general
question about the nature of law presupposes that law is a unique
social-political phenomenon, with more or less universal
characteristics that can be discerned through philosophical
analysis. General jurisprudence, as this philosophical inquiry about
the nature of law is called, is meant to be universal. It assumes that
law possesses certain features, and it possesses them by its very
nature, or essence, as law, whenever and wherever it happens to
exist. However, even if there are such universal characteristics of
law—which is controversial, as we will later discuss—the
reasons for a philosophical interest in elucidating them remain to be
explained. First, there is the sheer intellectual interest in
understanding such a complex social phenomenon which is, after all,
one of the most intricate aspects of human culture. Law, however, is
also a normative social practice: it purports to guide human behavior,
giving rise to reasons for action. An attempt to explain this
normative, reason-giving aspect of law is one of the main challenges
of general jurisprudence. These two sources of interest in the nature
of law are closely linked. Law is not the only normative domain in our
culture; morality, religion, social conventions, etiquette, and so on,
also guide human conduct in many ways which are similar to
law. Therefore, part of what is involved in the understanding of the
nature of law consists in an explanation of how law differs from these
similar normative domains, how it interacts with them, and whether its
intelligibility depends on other normative orders, like morality or
social conventions.


Contemporary legal theories define these two main interests in the
nature of law in the following terms. First, we need to understand the
general conditions that would render any putative norm legally valid.
Is it, for example, just a matter of the source of the norm, such as
its enactment by a particular political institution, or is it also a
matter of the norm’s content? This is the general question about the
conditions of legal validity. Second, there is the interest in the
normative aspect of law. This philosophical interest is twofold: A
complete philosophical account of the normativity of law comprises both
an explanatory and a justificatory task. The explanatory task consists
of an attempt to explain how legal norms can give rise to reasons for
action, and what kinds of reasons are involved. The task of
justification concerns the question of whether people ought to
comply—morally speaking or all things considered—with law’s
demands. In other words, it is the attempt to explain the moral
legitimacy of law and the subjects’ reasons for complying with it. A
theory about the nature of law, as opposed to critical theories of law,
concentrates on the first of these two questions. It purports to
explain what the normativity of law actually consists in. Some
contemporary legal philosophers, however, doubt that these two aspects
of the normativity of law can be separated. (We will return to this
later.)


Thus, elucidating the conditions of legal validity and explaining
the normativity of law form the two main subjects of any general theory
about the nature of law. In section 1, we will explain some of
the main debates about these two issues. In section 2, we will
discuss some of the methodological debates about the nature of general
jurisprudence. In the course of the last few centuries, two main rival
philosophical traditions have emerged about the nature of legality. The
older one, dating back to late mediaeval Christian scholarship, is
called the
 natural law
tradition. Since the early 19th century, natural law theories have been
fiercely challenged by the
 legal positivism
tradition promulgated by such scholars as
 Jeremy Bentham
and
 John Austin.
The philosophical
origins of legal positivism are much earlier, though, probably in the
 political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes. 
The main controversy between
these two traditions concerns the conditions of legal validity.
Basically, legal positivism asserts, and natural law denies, that the
conditions of legal validity are purely a matter of social facts. In
contrast to positivism, natural law claims that the conditions of legal
validity are not exhausted by social facts; the moral content of the
putative norms also bears on their legal validity. As the famous dictum, commonly attributed to Saint Augustine, has it: 
lex iniusta non est lex (unjust law is not law). (Augustine, De Libero Arbitrio, I, 5; see also Aquinas, Summa Theologica, I-II, Q. 96, Art. 4.)

Legal Interpretivism,0.4511761367321014,0.7926644682884216,"


Interpretivism about law offers a philosophical explanation of how
institutional practice—the legally significant action and
practices of political institutions—modifies legal rights and
obligations. Its core claim is that the way in which institutional
practice affects the law is determined by certain principles that
explain why the practice should have that role.  Interpretation of the
practice purports to identify the principles in question and thereby
the normative impact of the practice on citizens' rights and
responsibilities.


Interpretivism is famously associated with Ronald Dworkin, who
developed the position in a number of publications spanning 45 years
(see the works of Dworkin cited in the Bibliography).  Dworkin's
writings have stimulated a great deal of debate (the following are
some examples from the vast secondary literature: Mitchell 1983; Cohen

The Pure Theory of Law,0.448942095041275,0.8150606751441956,"


The idea of a Pure Theory of Law was propounded by the formidable
Austrian jurist and philosopher Hans Kelsen (1881–1973) (see the
bibliographical note). Kelsen began his long career as a legal
theorist at the beginning of the 20th century. The traditional legal
philosophies at the time, were, Kelsen claimed, hopelessly
contaminated with political ideology and moralizing on the one hand,
or with attempts to reduce the law to natural or social sciences, on
the other hand. He found both of these reductionist endeavors
seriously flawed.  Instead, Kelsen suggested a ‘pure’
theory of law which would avoid reductionism of any kind. The
jurisprudence Kelsen propounded “characterizes itself as a
‘pure’ theory of law because it aims at cognition focused
on the law alone” and this purity serves as its “basic
methodological principle” (PT1, 7).

Towards the end of his life, Aimé Césaire has declared
that the question he and his friend Léopold Sédar Senghor
came to raise after they first met was: “Who am I? Who are we?
What are we in this white world?” And he commented:
“That’s quite a problem” (Césaire 2005, 23).
“Who am I?” is a question Descartes posed, and a reader of
the French philosopher naturally understands such a question to be
universal, and the subject who says “I” here to stand for
any human being. But when “who am I?” has to be translated
as “who are we?” everything changes especially
when the “we” have to define themselves against a world
which leaves no room for who and what they are because they are black
folks in a world where “universal” seems to naturally mean
“white”.

“what are we in this white world?” is indeed “quite a

Neo-Kantianism,0.6436379551887512,0.4934400320053101,"

Neo-Kantianism was the dominant philosophical movement in Germany from
roughly 1870 until the First World War. This movement drew inspiration
from a diverse cast of philosophers—principally, Kuno Fischer
(Fischer 1860), Hermann von Helmholtz (Helmholtz 1867, 1878),
Friedrich Lange (Lange 1866), Otto Liebmann (Liebmann 1865), and
Eduard Zeller (Zeller 1862))—who in the middle of the nineteenth
century were calling for a return to Kant’s philosophy as an
alternative to both speculative metaphysics and materialism (Beiser
2014b). During the 1870s, the movement formed into two schools, one
based around Hermann Cohen at Marburg University and another based in
southwest Germany (in the province of Baden) around Wilhelm
Windelband. Later members of the Marburg School include Paul Natorp
and Ernst Cassirer; later members of the Southwest School include
Heinrich Rickert and Emil
 Lask.[1]

 Neo-Kantians[2]
 were not only intellectually influential, they were also great
successes academically in Germany. They held prominent academic
chairs, and were successful in placing their students, shaping
curricula, and editing important journals and books. Most of the
German philosophers who came to prominence in Germany after the First
World War were educated by Neo-Kantians—an impressive and
comprehensive list of students that includes Rudolf Carnap, Hans-Georg
Gadamer, Martin Heidegger, and Hans
 Reichenbach.[3]
 But the reputation of Neo-Kantianism shifted dramatically in the
decades after 1918. Neo-Kantians were associated with the old
order, and so became the primary targets of the many philosophers
(including their own students) wanting to make a completely fresh
start. The subsequent geopolitical upheavals, not the least of which
was Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, nearly erased the
institutional memory of Neo-Kantianism within the emerging analytic
and continental traditions. However, in the last few decades,
historians of philosophy of all stripes have begun to re-discover both
the historical and philosophical significance of Neo-Kantianism.

This article has three parts. After giving an overview of the common
features of Neo-Kantians, section 2 is devoted to the Marburg School,
and section 3 to the Southwest (SW) School. The Neo-Kantians were
systematic and comprehensive philosophers, writing on nearly every
area of philosophy. Instead of attempting to cover all areas of their
thought, this article will focus on the areas of their philosophies
that were most central to their thought, and that were most
influential on their contemporaries and successors. Accordingly, each
section begins with each school’s conception of philosophy
(sections 2.1 and 3.1), moves on to their theory of knowledge (2.2 and
3.2), and ends with the philosophy of the special sciences most
characteristic of each school (2.3 on Marburg philosophy of physics,
and 3.3 on SW philosophy of history). (Three supplementary documents
cover philosophies of logic, psychology, and mathematics in the
Marburg School.)

Neoplatonism,0.5961824655532837,0.19523946940898887,"
 The term “Neoplatonism” refers to a philosophical
school of thought that first emerged and flourished in the Greco-Roman
world of late antiquity, roughly from the time of the Roman Imperial
Crisis to the Arab conquest, i.e., the middle of the 3rd to
the middle of the 7th century. In consequence of the demise
of ancient materialist or corporealist thought such as Epicureanism
and Stoicism, Neoplatonism became the dominant philosophical ideology
of the period, offering a comprehensive understanding of the universe
and the individual human being’s place in it. However, in
contrast to labels such as “Stoic”,
“Peripatetic” or “Platonic”, the designation
“Neoplatonic” is of modern coinage and to some extent a
misnomer. Late antique philosophers now counted among “the
Neoplatonists” did not think of themselves as engaged in some
sort of effort specifically to revive the spirit and the letter of
Plato’s dialogues. To be sure, they did call themselves
“Platonists” and held Plato’s views, which they
understood as a positive system of philosophical doctrine, in higher
esteem than the tenets of the pre-Socratics, Aristotle, or any other
subsequent thinker. However, and more importantly, their signature
project is more accurately described as a grand synthesis of an
intellectual heritage that was by then exceedingly rich and
profound. In effect, they absorbed, appropriated, and creatively
harmonized almost the entire Hellenic tradition of philosophy,
religion, and even literature—with the exceptions of
Epicureanism, which they roundly rejected, and the thoroughgoing
corporealism of the Stoics. The result of this effort was a grandiose
and powerfully persuasive system of thought that reflected upon a
millennium of intellectual culture and brought the scientific and
moral theories of Plato, Aristotle, and the ethics of the Stoics into
fruitful dialogue with literature, myth, and religious practice. In
virtue of their inherent respect for the writings of many of their
predecessors, the Neoplatonists together offered a kind of
meta-discourse and reflection on the sum-total of ideas produced over
centuries of sustained inquiry into the human condition.
As a natural consequence of their insistence on the undiminished
relevance of the past, the Neoplatonists developed their
characteristically speculative brand of philosophical enquiry in which
empirical facts tended to serve as illustrations rather than heuristic
starting points or test cases. Today, the Neoplatonic system may
strike one as lofty, counterintuitive, and implausible, but to dismiss
it out of hand is difficult, especially if one is prepared to take
seriously a few fundamental assumptions that are at least not
obviously wrong and may possibly be right.
The most fundamental of these assumptions, which the Neoplatonists
shared with the majority of intellectuals of the ancient world,
including most pre-Socratic thinkers as well as Socrates, Plato,
Aristotle and their followers, is that mindful consciousness
(nous, often translated as thought, intelligence, or
intellect) is in an important sense ontologically prior to the
physical realm typically taken for ultimate reality (Mind over
Matter). There existed a dispute between Plato and Aristotle over
whether or not the objects of mindful consciousness (abstract
concepts, Platonic or otherwise, numbers, geometrical properties, and
so forth) are also ontologically prior, but the Neoplatonists regarded
this fact as a matter of inconsequential detail. And so, following a
venerable and abiding tradition of Mind over Matter, Neoplatonism
inevitably turned out to be an idealist type of philosophy.
The second assumption, which the Neoplatonists shared with the
Stoics and the Hermetists (an influential group of Egyptian religious
thinkers that predate the rise of Neoplatonism), was that reality, in
all its cognitive and physical manifestations, depended on a highest
principle which is unitary and singular. Neoplatonic philosophy is a
strict form of principle-monism that strives to understand everything
on the basis of a single cause that they considered divine, and
indiscriminately referred to as “the First”, “the
One”, or “the Good”. Since it is reasonable to
assume, as the Neoplatonists did, that any efficient cause is
ontologically prior to, and hence more real, than its effect, then, in
the hierarchy of being, the first principle, whatever it is, cannot be
less “real” than the phenomena it is supposed to explain.
Given the veracity of the first assumption (the ontological priority
of intelligence and consciousness), it follows at once that the first
principle must be a principle of consciousness. In consequence, the
fundamental challenge all Neoplatonists struggled to meet was
essentially the following: How are we to understand and describe the
emergence of the universe, with all its diverse phenomena, as the
effect of a singular principle of consciousness? In
particular—and in this regard Neoplatonism shares certain
concerns with modern cosmology—how is it possible to understand
the emergence of the physical, material universe from a singularity
that is in every sense unlike this universe? Their answer to this
question was entirely new, and went far beyond any prior cosmic
aetiology, including that of Plato’s Timaeus, in
elegance and sophistication.

Neurath was a social scientist, scientific philosopher and maverick
leader of the Vienna Circle who championed ‘the scientific
attitude’ and the Unity of Science movement. He denied any value
to philosophy over and above the pursuit of work on science, within
science and for science. And science was not logically fixed, securely
founded on experience nor was it the purveyor of any System of
knowledge.  Uncertainty, decision and cooperation were intrinsic to
it. From this naturalistic, holistic and pragmatist viewpoint,
philosophy investigates the conditions of the possibility of science
as apparent in science itself, namely, in terms of physical,
biological, social, psychological, linguistic, logical, mathematical,
etc. conditions. His views on the language, method and unity of
science were led throughout by his interest in the social life of
individuals and their well-being.  To theorize about society is
inseparable from theorizing for and within society. Science is in
every sense a social and historical enterprise.  It is as much about
social objectives as it is about physical objects, and about social
realizations as much as about empirical reality.  Objectivity and
rationality, epistemic values to constrain scientific thought, were
radically social.  The topics of political economy and visual
education, based on the ISOTYPE language, are concrete legacies that

Over the past three decades, philosophy of science has grown
increasingly “local.” Concerns have switched from general
features of scientific practice to concepts, issues, and puzzles
specific to particular disciplines. Philosophy of neuroscience is a
natural result.  This emerging area was also spurred by remarkable
recent growth in the neurosciences. Cognitive and computational
neuroscience continues to encroach upon issues traditionally addressed
within the humanities, including the nature of consciousness, action,
knowledge, and normativity. Empirical discoveries about brain
structure and function suggest ways that “naturalistic”
programs might develop in detail, beyond the abstract philosophical
considerations in their favor.


The literature distinguishes “philosophy of neuroscience”
and “neurophilosophy.” The former concerns foundational
issues within the neurosciences. The latter concerns application of
neuroscientific concepts to traditional philosophical
questions. Exploring various concepts of representation employed in
neuroscientific theories is an example of the former. Examining
implications of neurological syndromes for the concept of a unified
self is an example of the latter. In this entry, we will assume this
distinction and discuss examples of both.

Isaac Newton,0.6617337465286255,0.3945147097110748,"


Isaac Newton (1642–1727) is best known for having invented the
calculus in the mid to late 1660s (most of a decade before Leibniz did
so independently, and ultimately more influentially) and for having
formulated the theory of universal gravity — the latter in his
Principia, the single most important work in the
transformation of early modern natural philosophy into modern physical
science. Yet he also made major discoveries in optics beginning in the
mid-1660s and reaching across four decades; and during the course of
his 60 years of intense intellectual activity he put no less effort
into chemical and alchemical research and into theology and biblical
studies than he put into mathematics and physics. He became a dominant
figure in Britain almost immediately following publication of his
Principia in 1687, with the consequence that
“Newtonianism” of one form or another had become firmly
rooted there within the first decade of the eighteenth century. His
influence on the continent, however, was delayed by the strong
opposition to his theory of gravity expressed by such leading figures
as Christiaan Huygens and Leibniz, both of whom saw the theory as
invoking an occult power of action at a distance in the absence of
Newton's having proposed a contact mechanism by means of which forces
of gravity could act. As the promise of the theory of gravity became
increasingly substantiated, starting in the late 1730s but especially
during the 1740s and 1750s, Newton became an equally dominant figure
on the continent, and “Newtonianism,” though perhaps in
more guarded forms, flourished there as well. What physics textbooks
now refer to as “Newtonian mechanics” and “Newtonian
science” consists mostly of results achieved on the continent
between 1740 and 1800.

for the study of nature. Newton's contributions to
mathematics—including the co-discovery of the calculus with his
(eventual) foe Leibniz—and to what is now called physics,
including both its experimental and theoretical aspects, will forever
dominate discussions of his lasting influence. But his impact on the
development of early modern philosophy was also profound, so much so
that it is difficult to grasp the history of philosophy in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries without considering
Newton's role. His engagement with Cartesian ideas and methods early
in his life was just as significant to the transformation of
philosophy in the seventeenth century as his debates with Leibniz were
to the setting of the agenda of philosophy in the eighteenth.
Obviously, Newton is not part of the traditional canon of the period,
which would focus on the great sextet, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz,
Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. (The distinction between the two pairs of
three “rationalists” and “empiricists” owes
much to the Kantian conception of the history of philosophy in the
late eighteenth century.) But this conception of the canon has been
challenged substantially by the past generation of scholarship. And
ironically, with the possible exception of Spinoza, Newton engaged
with or personally influenced the other five canonical philosophers of
the early modern era (cf. Schliesser 2012). Thus Newton's
contributions to, and influence on, early modern philosophy is a rich
topic.

"Newton's Views on Space, Time, and Motion",0.6999755501747131,0.3175866901874542,"


Isaac Newton founded classical mechanics on the view that
space  is distinct from body and that time
passes uniformly without regard to whether anything happens
in the world. For this reason he spoke of absolute space and
absolute time, so as to distinguish these entities from the
various ways by which we measure them (which he called relative
spaces and relative times). From antiquity into the
eighteenth century, contrary views which denied that space and time
are real entities maintained that the world is necessarily a material
plenum. Concerning space, they held that the idea of empty space is a
conceptual impossibility. Space is nothing but an abstraction we use
to compare different arrangements of the bodies constituting the
plenum. Concerning time, they insisted, there can be no lapse of time
without change occurring somewhere. Time is merely a measure of 
cycles of change within the world.  

 Associated with these issues about the ontological status of space
and time was the question of the nature of true motion. Newton defined
the true motion of a body to be its motion through absolute
space. Those who, before or shortly after Newton, rejected the reality
of space, did not necessarily deny that there is a fact of the matter
as to the state of true motion of any given body. They thought rather
that the concept of true motion could be analyzed in terms of the
specifics of the relative motions or the causes thereof. The
difficulty (or, as Newton alleged, the impossibility) of so doing
constituted for Newton a strong argument for the existence of absolute
space.  

 In recent literature, Newton's theses regarding the ontology of space
and time have come to be called substantivalism in contrast
to relationism. It should be emphasized, though, that Newton
did not regard space and time as genuine substances (as are,
paradigmatically, bodies and minds), but rather as real entities with
their own manner of existence as necessitated by God's existence (more
specifically, his omnipresence and eternality).

Nicholas of Autrecourt,0.7018476128578186,0.2027101367712021,"


The most striking feature of Autrecourt's academic career is his
condemnation in 1347. In almost every history of medieval philosophy,
his censure is presented as one of the most important events in
fourteenth-century Paris. In the older literature, Autrecourt's views
have become linked to allegedly skeptical tendencies in scholastic
thought, and have been unduly shadowed by assumptions about their
relation to the views of William of Ockham. Over the last two decades,
however, it has become apparent that the study of Autrecourt's thought
has been wrongly placed in the larger context of the battle against
Ockhamism at the University of Paris in the years 1339-1347. Although
Autrecourt was no skeptic — on the contrary, he attacked the
“Academics” or ancient Skeptics — his philosophical stance challenges
the prevailing Aristotelian tradition. In particular, Autrecourt
rejected some of the main tenets of scholastic metaphysics and
epistemology, such as the substance-accident structure of reality and
the principle of causality.

Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a German philosopher and
cultural critic who published intensively in the 1870s and 1880s. He
is famous for uncompromising criticisms of traditional European
morality and religion, as well as of conventional philosophical ideas
and social and political pieties associated with modernity. Many of
these criticisms rely on psychological diagnoses that expose false
consciousness infecting people’s received ideas; for that
reason, he is often associated with a group of late modern thinkers
(including Marx and Freud) who advanced a “hermeneutics of
suspicion” against traditional values (see Foucault [1964] 1990,
Ricoeur [1965] 1970, Leiter 2004). Nietzsche also used his
psychological analyses to support original theories about the nature
of the self and provocative proposals suggesting new values that he
thought would promote cultural renewal and improve social and
psychological life by comparison to life under the traditional values
he criticized.

Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a German philosopher of the late
19th century who challenged the foundations of Christianity and
traditional morality. He was interested in the enhancement of
individual and cultural health, and believed in life, creativity,
power, and down-to-earth realities, rather than those
situated in a world beyond. Central to his philosophy is the idea of
“life-affirmation,” which involves an honest questioning of
all doctrines that drain life’s expansive energies, however socially
prevalent those views might be. Often referred to as one of the first
existentialist philosophers along with Søren Kierkegaard
(1813–1855), Nietzsche’s revitalizing philosophy has inspired leading
figures in all walks of cultural life, including dancers, poets,
novelists, painters, psychologists, philosophers, sociologists and

Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy,0.4114623367786408,0.5076205134391785,"


Nietzsche's moral philosophy is primarily critical in
orientation: he attacks morality both for its commitment to untenable
descriptive (metaphysical and empirical) claims about human agency, as
well as for the deleterious impact of its distinctive norms and values
on the flourishing of the highest types of human beings (Nietzsche's
“higher men”). His positive ethical views are best
understood as combining (i) a kind of consequentialist perfectionism
as Nietzsche's implicit theory of the good, with (ii) a conception of
human perfection involving both formal and substantive elements.
Because Nietzsche, however, is an anti-realist about
value, he takes neither his positive vision, nor those aspects of
his critique that depend upon it, to have any special epistemic
status, a fact which helps explain his rhetoric and the circumspect
character of his “esoteric” moralizing. Although
Nietzsche's illiberal attitudes (for example, about human
equality) are apparent, there are no grounds for ascribing to him a
political philosophy, since he has no systematic (or even partly
systematic) views about the nature of state and society. As an
esoteric moralist, Nietzsche aims at freeing higher human beings from
their false consciousness about morality (their false belief that this
morality is good for them), not at a transformation of
society at large.

Nominalism comes in at least two varieties. In one of them it is the
rejection of abstract objects; in the other it is the rejection of
universals. Philosophers have often found it necessary to postulate
either abstract objects or universals. And so Nominalism in one form or
another has played a significant role in the metaphysical debate since
at least the Middle Ages, when versions of the second variety of
Nominalism were introduced. The two varieties of Nominalism are
independent from each other and either can be consistently held without
the other. However, both varieties share some common motivations and
arguments. This entry surveys nominalistic theories of both

Nonexistent Objects,0.7965297102928162,0.5659394264221191,"


A nonexistent object is something that does not exist. Some examples
often cited are: Zeus, Pegasus, Sherlock Holmes, Vulcan, the perpetual
motion machine, the golden mountain, the fountain of youth, the round
square, etc.  Some important philosophers have thought that the very
concept of a nonexistent object is contradictory (Hume) or logically
ill-formed (Kant, Frege), while others (Leibniz, Meinong, the Russell
of Principles of Mathematics) have embraced it
wholeheartedly.


One of the reasons why there are doubts about the concept of a
nonexistent object is this: to be able to say truly of an object that
it doesn't exist, it seems that one has to presuppose that it exists,
for doesn't a thing have to exist if we are to make a true claim about
it? In the face of this puzzling situation, one has to be very careful
when accepting or formulating the idea that there are nonexistent
objects. It turns out that Kant's view that “exists” is not
a “real” predicate and Frege's view, that
“exists” is not a predicate of individuals (i.e., a
predicate that yields a well-formed sentence if one puts a singular
term in front of it), has to be abandoned if one is to accept the claim
that there are nonexistent objects.


This entry is an examination of the many questions which arise in
connection with the view that there are nonexistent objects. The
following are particularly salient: What reasons are there (if any) for
thinking that there are nonexistent objects? If there are nonexistent
objects, then what kind of objects are they? How can they be
characterized? Is it possible to provide a consistent theory of
nonexistent objects? What is the explanatory force of a consistent
theory of nonexistent objects (if such a thing is possible)?

The Nonidentity Problem,0.5166014432907104,0.7982786893844604,"


The nonidentity problem focuses on the obligations we think we have in
respect of people who, by our own acts, are caused both to exist and
to have existences that are, though worth having, unavoidably flawed
– existences, that is, that are flawed if those people are ever
to have them at all.  If a person’s existence is unavoidably
flawed, then the agent’s only alternatives to bringing that person
into the flawed existence are to bring no one into existence at all or
to bring a different person – a nonidentical but better
off person – into existence in place of the person whose
existence is flawed.  If the existence is worth having and no one
else’s interests are at stake, it is unclear on what ground morality
would insist that the choice to bring the one person into the flawed
existence is morally wrong.  And yet at the same time – as we
shall see – it seems that in some cases that choice
clearly is morally wrong.  The nonidentity problem is the
problem of resolving this apparent paradox.


The problem raises the question whether the (usually significant) good
that an agent confers along with existence counterbalances the
(usually limited) bad that an agent confers along with any
unavoidably flawed existence in such a way that our
existence-inducing act (usually) will be deemed permissible.  And if
it isn’t – if we think instead that obligations are left
unsatisfied despite the good that comes with existence – is the
moral of the story that moral obligation extends beyond what
we must do for people?  If we agree, in other words, that it
is our obligation to create additional good, is it enough that we
create additional good for each and every existing and future
person?  Or does the nonidentity problem show that our focus
should instead be on creating additional good for the
universe?  As we query how to evaluate existence-inducing acts
for their moral permissibility – as well as outcomes or possible
futures or worlds, for their moral betterness against still
other worlds – we find that some of our most deeply held
intuitions regarding the nature and structure of morality are thrown
into doubt.

Social Norms,0.7183251976966858,0.8368023633956909,"


Social norms, the customary rules that govern behavior in groups and
societies, have been extensively studied in the social sciences.
Anthropologists have described how social norms function in different
cultures (Geertz 1973), sociologists have focused on their social
functions and how they motivate people to act (Durkheim 1950; Parsons
1937, Parsons and Shils 1951; Coleman 1990; Hechter and Opp 2001), and
economists have explored how adherence to norms influences market
behavior (Akerlof 1976; Young 1998). More recently, also legal
scholars have touted social norms as efficient alternatives to legal
rules, as they may internalize negative externalities and provide
signaling mechanisms at little or no cost (Ellickson 1991; Posner
2000).


With a few exceptions, the social science literature conceives of
norms as exogenous variables. Since norms are mainly seen as
constraining behavior, some of the important differences between moral,
social and legal norms, as well as differences between norms and
conventions, have been blurred. Much attention instead has
been paid to the conditions under which norms will be obeyed.
Because of that, the issue of sanctions has been paramount in
the social science literature. Moreover, since social norms
are seen as central to the production of social order or social
coordination, research on norms has been focused on the
functions they perform, and whether they do so
efficiently. Yet even if a norm may fulfill important social
functions such as welfare maximization or the elimination of
externalities, it cannot be explained solely or mainly on the basis of
the functions it performs. The simplistic functionalist
perspective has been rejected on several accounts since, even if a
given norm can be conceived as a means to achieve some social goal,
this is usually not the reason why it emerged in the first place
(Elster 1989). Moreover, though a particular norm may persist (as
opposed to emerge) because of some positive social function it
fulfills, there are many others that are inefficient and even widely
unpopular.


Philosophers have taken a different approach to norms. In the
literature on norms and conventions, both social constructs are seen as
the endogenous product of individuals' interactions (Lewis 1969;
Ullmann-Margalit 1977; Vandershraaf 1995; Bicchieri 2006). Norms
are represented as equilibria of games of strategy, and as such they
are supported by a cluster of self-fulfilling expectations.
Beliefs, expectations, group knowledge and common knowledge have thus
become central concepts in the development of a philosophical view of
social norms. Paying attention to the role played by expectations
in supporting social norms has helped differentiate between social
norms, conventions, and descriptive norms, an important distinction
often overlooked in the social science accounts.

John Norris (1657 – 1711) continued the broadly Cartesian
project in late 17th Century England despite the
ever-growing prominence of Lockean empiricism. Norris wrote on
numerous topics, including politics, religion, philosophy and the
Christian life. He also composed poetry. This entry describes several
of Norris' most noteworthy advances and insights.


One important goal of his philosophical writing was the completion of
Malebranche's project. Norris believed Malebranche did not prove the
existence of the intelligible world, viz. the mind of God.  Nor did
Malebranche offer a full account of the nature of the intelligible
world. Norris adopted Descartes' view of the structure of thought, and
a Malebranchean view of the contents of thought. He also elaborated a
version of Descartes' real distinction proof in order to weaken
Locke's thinking matter hypothesis. Proving the existence and
immortality of the soul was a prime concern for Norris. Moreover, he
was troubled by the heterodox theological views of the Enthusiasts
(Quakers) and Socinians. He constructed numerous arguments against
their doctrines by utilizing the “divine light,”
characterized within what he called his “Ideal
Philosophy.”

The philosophical impact of early German romanticism in general and
Georg Philipp Friedrich von Hardenberg (Novalis) in particular has
typically been traced back to a series of fragments and reflections on
poetry, art, and beauty. Moreover, his name has been associated with an
aestheticization of philosophy, an illegitimate valorizing of the
medieval, and a politically reactionary program. This view of von
Hardenberg, however, is to a large extent rooted in the image created
posthumously by his increasingly conservative friends within the
romantic circle. Furthermore, von Hardenberg's philosophical
reputation has been shaped by his critics, the most
prominent of whom was Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.


In spite of his death at 28, von Hardenberg (1772–1801) left behind a
complex philosophical legacy that encompasses discussions of
subjectivity and self-consciousness, issues in epistemology, moral
theory, political philosophy, problems of interpretation, philosophy of
history, philosophy of religion, the proto-existentialist experience of
the finality of human life, as well as a significant
contribution to aesthetics and philosophy of art. While von Hardenberg
is best known for his literary production—including the prose
poem Hymns to the Night (1800) and the unfinished novels
The Apprentice from Said and Heinrich von Ofterdingen
(both published in 1802)—this overview focuses on the
argumentative presuppositions for and systematic implications of von
Hardenberg's philosophical work (without thereby suggesting that
his philosophy should be perceived as entirely separate from his poetic
production).

restricts its activities to the protection of the rights of life,

Numenius,0.584111213684082,0.1899854987859726,"


Numenius, a Platonist philosopher of the mid 2nd century
CE, had considerable impact on later Platonism, most notably on
Plotinus (3rd c.) and Porphyry
(3rd-4th c.  His work survives only in
fragments, either as excerpts or in reports in later sources, mostly
Platonists, both pagan and Christian (e.g. Porphyry, Proclus,
Calcidius, Origen, Eusebius). Numenius' work is important both
historically and philosophically. Its historical significance lies
mainly in that it shows how much of Plotinus' philosophy, especially
Plotinus' metaphysics, was inspired by earlier Platonists such as
Numenius, who was one of the authors read in Plotinus' seminar
(Porphyry, Life of Plotinus 14.12).  Plotinus' debt to
Numenius' philosophy was much debated already by Platonists of
Plotinus' generation (ibid. 18.2–3, 17.1–23). This
discussion shows that Plotinus was not considered in his own time to
have initiated a new and distinct movement in Platonism—what we
today call Neoplatonism. He was rather seen as simply continuing and
developing the philosophy of previous Platonists, Numenius being
prominent among them, just as they themselves had developed in similar
fashion the work of their own Platonist predecessors. Numenius'
significance also lies in his impact on the thought of early Christian
thinkers like Origen and Eusebius, who are captured by Numenius'
references to Hebrews and see in his theology a prefiguration of their
trinitarian doctrine. Philosophically, Numenius' work is important
because he, like Eudorus and Moderatus (1st c. CE), tried
to construct a hierarchical system of intelligible principles
(archai) of reality, but unlike them he held that
intelligible principles are responsible only for the order of the
world, wherein its goodness lies, while matter has an existence
independent of these principles and accounts for disorder and
badness. In this sense Numenius maintains a dualism in metaphysics
that has affinities with that of Plutarch. Numenius' system of three
principles of reality, similar to Plotinus' hypostases of One,
Intellect and Soul, was constructed on the basis of accounts of the
intelligible world and its primacy, and of the soul as a spiritual
substance essentially related to that world, in Plato. More
specifically, it results from reflection on the Form of the Good in
Republic VI, the demiurge and the world-soul of the
Timaeus, and the One of the Parmenides. The
hierarchical order of these principles of reality is determined by the
degree of unity and simplicity of each; the highest principle is the
simplest and most completely a unity. It is also absolutely good and transmits goodness.

Michael Oakeshott (1901–1990) is commonly viewed as a
conservative thinker and critic of government planning. But that view
notices only one aspect of Oakeshott’s thought and invites
misunderstanding because his ideas about government are not the
conventional ones this characterization suggests. His ideas spring not
from practical engagement but from study of the history of European
political thought, sharpened by philosophical reflection on its
arguments and their presuppositions. Like many other philosophers,
Oakeshott saw philosophical questions as connected and as inviting
wide-ranging critical investigations. His contribution to philosophy
is therefore not limited to politics. It lies in distinguishing modes
of understanding and inquiry, identifying different conceptions of
rationality and their place in practical judgment, distinguishing the
idea of the state as an association in terms of noninstrumental laws
from that of the state as a corporate enterprise, and theorizing the
character of history as a mode of inquiry and its place in explaining
human conduct. Oakeshott also wrote on the history of political
thought, especially the thought of Thomas Hobbes, as well as on
religion, morals, education, aesthetics, and the character of
political discourse. A recurrent theme in his writings is the tension
between individuality, which implies plurality, and its denial, which
he characterized as barbarism. Given his concern with individual
freedom and his doubts about regarding politics as the pursuit of
political ideals, the current interest of political philosophers in
republican ideas of freedom as nondomination and in realism in
political discourse as an alternative to political moralism suggests
the continuing relevance of Oakeshott’s arguments. Rather than
surveying all of these topics, this entry will focus on his most
important contributions to philosophy: his theory of modes of
experience, his criticism of political rationalism, his argument that
the key tension in modern politics is over the character and purpose
of the state, and his philosophy of history.

[Editor's Note: The following new entry by Bradley Rettler and Andrew Bailey replaces the
 former entry
on this topic by the previous author.]



One task of metaphysics is to carve reality into
 categories.[1]
 Some things could have failed to exist; they fall under the category
contingent being. Some are events; they fall under
event. And so on. One might well wonder—is there a
category under which every thing falls? Offering an
informative account of such a category is no easy task. For nothing
would distinguish things that fall under it from those that
don’t—there being, after all, none of the latter. It seems
hard, then, to say much about any fully general category; and it would
appear to do no carving or categorizing or dividing at all.
Nonetheless there are candidates for such a fully general office,
including thing, being, entity, item,
existent,

and—especially—object.[2]

It is not obvious that there is any fully general category (whether
object or otherwise). Accordingly, not all accounts of
object assign it to a fully general category, instead
allowing that there are non-objects. On those views, object
does indeed divide.

Accounts of object, then, differ with respect to whether
there are non-objects. And this is not the only fault line. Other
dimensions of difference include what objects there are and
what objects are. Accordingly, this entry will survey three
broad questions about the category object:

What, if any, is its contrast or
complement?
What is its extension?
What is its nature?


Each of these questions admits of various specifications and answers
that we will consider in turn. Our focus will be largely theoretical
and taxonomical, so we will only occasionally refer to historical
sources. Our topic is abstract and broad, and touches on a number of
issues in metaphysics that already enjoy coverage in this
Encyclopedia. Our discussion of such topics will be brief; in
those cases, we will recommend consultation of the extant entries for
a more detailed treatment.

Scientific Objectivity,0.8755038976669312,0.529449462890625,"
Scientific objectivity is a characteristic of scientific claims,
methods and results. It expresses the idea that the claims, methods
and results of science are not, or should not be influenced by
particular perspectives, value commitments, community bias or personal
interests, to name a few relevant factors. Objectivity is often
considered as an ideal for scientific inquiry, as a good reason for
valuing scientific knowledge, and as the basis of the authority of
science in society.
Many central debates in the philosophy of science have, in one way
or another, to do with objectivity: confirmation and the problem of
induction; theory choice and scientific change; realism; scientific
explanation; experimentation; measurement and quantification; evidence
and the foundations of statistics; evidence-based science; feminism
and values in science. Understanding the role of objectivity in
science is therefore integral to a full appreciation of these
debates. As this article testifies, the reverse is true too: it is
impossible to fully appreciate the notion of scientific objectivity
without touching upon many of these debates.
The ideal of objectivity has been criticized repeatedly in
philosophy of science, questioning both its value and its
attainability. This article focuses on the question of how scientific
objectivity should be defined, whether the ideal of objectivity is
desirable, and to what extent scientists can achieve it. In line with
the idea that the epistemic authority of science relies primarily on
the objectivity of scientific reasoning, we focus on the role of

Special Obligations,0.4135363698005676,0.7574781775474548,"


Special obligations are obligations owed to some subset of persons,
in contrast to natural duties that are owed to all persons simply
qua persons. Common sense morality seems to understand us as
having special obligations to those to whom we stand in some sort of
special relationship, e.g., our friends, our family members, our
colleagues, our fellow citizens, and those to whom we have made
promises or commitments of some sort. Special obligations are often
appealed to in arguments against consequentialism, because
consequentialism is unable to accommodate agent-relative reasons and
genuinely special obligations are agent-relative reasons. Attempts to
defend special obligations run up against objections from insiders –
why suppose that I am obligated to do more for certain persons just
because I happen to stand in some special relationship to them? – and
also from outsiders – why do other persons get more benefits just
because they happen to stand in special relationships to other persons?
Attempts to ground special obligations have appealed to diverse states
of affairs, including the intrinsic nature of the special relationship,
the nature of the party to whom the obligations are owed, the
expectations of the party to whom the obligations are owed, and the
nature of persons as psychological continuants bound by relations
between mental states.

Occasionalism,0.6355212926864624,0.3059597611427307,"


We live in a world that seems to be brimming with causal activity. I
push the keys on my keyboard, and letters appear on the screen. Outside
the wind blows leaves across the patio. The ringing of the phone cuts
short my idling thoughts.


Philosophers have long wondered about the nature of causality. Are
there true causes at work in the world, and, if so, what makes them the
causes they are? How do causes bring things about, and what kind of
connection does a cause have to its effect? These questions took on
another level of complexity when various religious and theological
considerations were brought to bear on these issues. For instance,
philosophers came to question how divine causal activity is to be
understood, particularly, in relation to the natural causality of
creatures. It is from this context, in which questions about the nature
of causation intermixed with questions about the relation between
divine and natural causality, that occasionalism emerged. Occasionalism
attempts to address these questions by presenting as its core thesis
the claim that God is the one and only true cause. In the words of the
most famous occasionalist of the Western philosophical tradition,
Nicolas Malebranche, “there is only one true cause because there
is only one true God; …the nature or power of each thing is
nothing but the will of God; … all natural causes are not
true causes but only occasional causes”
(OCM II, 312 / Search 448) A full-blown
occasionalist, then, might be described as one who subscribes to the
following two tenets: (1) the positive thesis that God is the only
genuine cause; (2) the negative thesis that no creaturely cause is a
genuine cause but at most an occasional cause. Not all philosophers who
have been identified as occasionalists, however, were full-blown
occasionalists in this sense, since some argued that only a limited
subset of creatures lack causal powers, and thus affirmed the causal
efficacy of other creatures. In addition to this issue of the scope of
occasionalism, we will, in the following sections, examine how these
core theses of occasionalism address the issues aforementioned and what
arguments are presented in their favor. We begin, however, with a brief
discussion about its history.

Omnipotence,0.6957693099975586,0.5901730060577393,"

Omnipotence is maximal power. Maximal greatness (or perfection)
includes omnipotence. According to traditional Western theism, God is
maximally great (or perfect), and therefore is omnipotent. Omnipotence
seems puzzling, even paradoxical, to many philosophers. They wonder,
for example, whether God can create a spherical cube, or make a stone
so massive that he cannot move it. Is there a consistent analysis of
omnipotence? What are the implications of such an analysis for the
nature of God?

Omnipresence,0.6968586444854736,0.5279794335365295,"


The psalmist asks God,
Where can I go from your spirit?
Or where can I flee from your presence?
If I ascend to heaven, you are there;
If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there. 
                       
 (Psalms 139: 7-8, NRSV)
Philosophers and theologians have taken such texts to affirm that
God is present everywhere. This passage suggests, first, that God is
really present at or located at various particular
places.  Second, it suggests that there is no place where God is not
present, that is, that God is present everywhere. This is the
claim that God is omnipresent. Divine omnipresence is thus
one of the traditional divine attributes, although it has attracted
less philosophical attention than such attributes as
 omnipotence,
 omniscience, or
 being eternal.
Philosophers who have attempted to give an account of omnipresence
have identified several interesting philosophical questions that an
adequate account of omnipresence must address: How can a being who is
supposed to be immaterial be present at or located in space?
If God is located in a particular place, can anything else be located
there, too? If God is present everywhere, does it follow that he has
parts in each of the particular places in which he is located?
Various philosophers have proposed accounts of omnipresence in terms
that are supposed to apply to an immaterial being. This essay will
examine some of these proposals.

Omniscience,0.7218727469444275,0.6058880686759949,"

Omniscience is the property of having complete or maximal knowledge.
Along with omnipotence and perfect goodness, it is usually taken to be
one of the central divine attributes. Once source of the attribution
of omniscience to God derives from the numerous biblical passages that
ascribe vast knowledge to him. St. Thomas Aquinas (Summa
Theologiae I, q. 14), in his discussion of the knowledge of God,
cites such texts as Job 12:13: “With God are wisdom and
strength; he has counsel and understanding” and Rom. 11:33:
“O the depths of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of
God!” Another source is provided by the requirements of
formulating one or another theological doctrine. For example, the
doctrine of divine providence holds that God has a plan for the world
according to which all things are in his care and work out according
to his good will. As Flint puts it, 


to see God as provident is to see him as knowingly and lovingly
directing each and every event involving each and every creature
toward the ends he has ordained for them. (1998: 12) 


It is thus tempting to think than an account of providence requires
attributing vast knowledge to God. (For a dissenting interpretation of
providence which does not require complete knowledge, see Hasker
2004.) Philosophical considerations of so-called “perfect being
theology” provide a third motivation for including omniscience
among the divine attributes. Perfect being theology appeals to St.
Anselm, who held that God is that than which nothing greater can be
thought (Proslogion, c.1077). Anselm expands on what he means
by greatness by giving the formula that “God is whatever it is
better to be than not”, and he concludes that this includes such
properties as making other things from nothing, being just, being
happy, and being perceptive, omnipotent, and merciful. This entry will
address philosophical issues concerning omniscience as a divine
attribute or a perfection, without considering its potential
application in theology.

Ontological Commitment,0.8322684764862059,0.6665629148483276,"
Ontology, as etymology suggests, is the study of being, of
what there is. The ontologist asks: What entities or kinds of entity
exist? Are there abstract entities, such as sets or numbers, in
addition to concrete entities, such as people and puddles and protons?
Are there properties or universals in addition to (or instead of) the
particular entities that, as we say, instantiate them? Questions such
as these have divided philosophers down the ages, and divide them no
less to this day.
Meta-ontology concerns itself with the nature and
methodology of ontology, with the interpretation and significance of
ontological questions such as those exhibited above. The problem
of ontological commitment is a problem in meta-ontology rather
than ontology
 proper.[1] 
The meta-ontologist asks (among other
things): What entities or kinds of entity exist according to a
given theory or discourse, and thus are among
its ontological commitments? Having a criterion of
ontological commitment for theories is needed, arguably, if one is to
systematically and rigorously attack the problem of ontology:
typically, we accept entities into our ontology via accepting
theories that are ontologically committed to those entities. A
criterion of ontological commitment, then, is a pre-requisite for
ontological inquiry.
On its face, the notion of ontological commitment for theories is a
simple matter. Theories have truth conditions. These truth conditions
tell us how the world must be in order for the theory to be true; they
make demands on the world. Sometimes, perhaps always, they demand of
the world that certain entities or kinds of entity exist. The
ontological commitments of a theory, then, are just the entities or
kinds of entity that must exist in order for the theory to be
true. End of story (compare Rayo 2007: 428).
But complications arise as soon as one tries to specify a theory's
truth conditions: different accounts of truth conditions lead to
different accounts of ontological commitment.  Moreover, theories
couched in ordinary language do not wear their truth
conditions—or their ontological commitments—on their
sleeves. Thus, the need arises to find a criterion of
ontological commitment: a test or method that can be applied to
theories in a neutral way to determine the theory's ontological
commitments. For example, perhaps the theory should first be
translated into a canonical formal language, such as the language of
first-order predicate logic, where truth conditions, and thus
ontological commitments, are easier to specify. But whenever these
translations are controversial, so will be the verdicts as to
ontological commitment. And, even when translated into a formal
language, such as the language of first-order predicate logic,
different ontological standpoints may disagree as to the existential
presuppositions of the theory. The notion of ontological commitment,
introduced to help resolve disputes in ontology, becomes hostage to
those very disputes. Strife over the ontological commitments of
theories begins to appear inevitable.
The following article canvasses and evaluates the most prominent
approaches to ontological commitment. It starts with Quinean
approaches that focus on the existential quantifier and the values of
the variables. It then contrasts Quinean approaches with more general
entailment approaches that drop the preoccupation with the
quantifier. It then considers a strengthening of the entailment
approach that requires that ontological commitments of a theory
be truthmakers for that theory. It then steps back to examine
how, and to what extent, the notion of ontological commitment can be
applied to ordinary language. The article concludes by considering
less orthodox views associated with Frege and with Carnap.

Social Ontology,0.6542873978614807,0.715956449508667,"

Social ontology is the study of the nature and properties of the
social world. It is concerned with analyzing the various entities in
the world that arise from social interaction.

A prominent topic in social ontology is the analysis of social groups.
Do social groups exist at all? If so, what sorts of entities are they,
and how are they created? Is a social group distinct from the
collection of people who are its members, and if so, how is it
different? What sorts of properties do social groups have? Can they
have beliefs or intentions? Can they perform actions? And if so, what
does it take for a group to believe, intend, or act?

Other entities investigated in social ontology include money,
corporations, institutions, property, social classes, races, genders,
artifacts, artworks, language, and law. It is difficult to delineate a
precise scope for the field (see
 section 2.1).
 In general, though, the entities explored in social ontology largely
overlap with those that social scientists work on. A good deal of the
work in social ontology takes place within the social sciences (see
 sections 5.1–5.8).

Social ontology also addresses more basic questions about the nature
of the social world. One set of questions pertains to the
constituents, or building blocks, of social things in general. For
instance, some theories argue that social entities are built out of
the psychological states of individual people, while others argue that
they are built out of actions, and yet others that they are built out
of practices. Still other theories deny that a distinction can even be
made between the social and the non-social.

A different set of questions pertains to how social categories are
constructed or set up. Are social categories and kinds produced by our
attitudes? By our language? Are they produced by causal patterns? And
is there just one way social categories are set up, or are there many
varieties of social construction?

The term ‘social ontology’ has only come into wide
currency in recent years, but the nature of the social has been a
topic of inquiry since ancient Greece. As a whole, the field can be
understood as a branch of metaphysics, the general inquiry into the
nature of entities.

History of the Ontology of Art,0.585495114326477,0.5104026794433594,"


Questions central to the ontology of art include the following: what
sort(s) of things are works of art? Do all works of art belong to any
one basic ontological category?  Do all or only some works have
multiple instances? Do works have (material) parts or constituents,
and if so, what is their relation to the work as a whole? How are
particular works of art individuated? Are they created or discovered?
Can they be destroyed?


Explicit and extensive treatments of these topics written
prior to the 19th century have yet to be found. This does
not mean, however, that there is nothing relevant to these ontological
questions in early writings on beauty, the arts, and related
matters. For example, Aristotle’s claims about the functions and
elements of tragedy (see Gerald Else 1957) can be mined for ideas
about the nature of literary works more generally. And what can be
made of the hint, in
Metaphysics Eta, 6, that the unity of The Iliad is
a matter of a set of words made “one” by being connected together?


Rather than attempting to make conjectures about such difficult
exegetical topics, this entry focuses primarily on contributions made
by authors who explicitly address themselves at length to some of the
aforementioned questions pertaining to the ontology of works of art,
either in general or with reference to such major art forms as music,
literature, painting, architecture, and sculpture.


One further note about the scope of this entry is in
order. Instructive surveys of the subfield of aesthetics known as the
ontology of art are fairly plentiful; see Nicholas Wolterstorff
(1992), Gregory Currie (1998, 2010), Joseph Margolis (1998), Stephen
Davies (2003a), Amie Thomasson (2004, 2006b), Guy Rohrbaugh (2005),
Theodore Gracyk (2009), Robert Stecker (2010), and Carl Matheson and
Ben Caplan (2011). Surveys of the history of the field have
not, however, been forthcoming, and the comments on this topic that
crop up in the literature are sketchy and sometimes quite
misleading. One shortcoming has been a marked tendency to focus on
contributions from the last two decades of the 20th
century, the one salient exception being due attention paid to works
by Roman Ingarden (e.g, 1931, 1962, and see the entry on Ingarden).
The present entry has been designed with this shortcoming in mind.  A
schematic mapping of questions and positions is provided and reference
is made to neglected, earlier contributions to the ontology of
art.

Operationalism,0.9163033366203308,0.3099507391452789,"


Operationalism is based on the intuition that we do not know the
meaning of a concept unless we have a method of measurement for
it. It is commonly considered a theory of meaning which states
that “we mean by any concept nothing more than a set of
operations; the concept is synonymous with the corresponding set of
operations” (Bridgman 1927, 5). That drastic statement
was made in The Logic of Modern Physics, published in 1927 by the
American physicist P. W. Bridgman. The operationalist point of
view, first expounded at length in that book, initially found many
advocates among practicing physicists and those inspired by the
tradition of American pragmatism or the new philosophy of logical
positivism. It is highly doubtful that Bridgman intended to
advance a precise and universal theory of meaning, or any systematic
philosophical theory at all. His writings were primarily
“reflections of a
 physicist”[1]
rooted in experimental practice and aimed at
articulating the scientific method from a first-person point of
view. However, as Bridgman's ideas gained currency they
were shaped into a general philosophical doctrine of
“operationalism” or “operationism”, and in that
form became very influential in many areas, especially in
methodological debates in psychology. Both in philosophy and in
psychology operationalism is nowadays commonly regarded as an extreme
and outmoded position, but that is not to say that the potential of
Bridgman's original ideas has been exhausted.


This article has three sections, each of which serves a different
aim. Section 1 introduces Bridgman's key ideas on
operational analysis, explaining their motivations and tracing the
course of their development. Section 2 summarizes various
critiques of operationalism, which eventually led to a general
philosophical consensus against it. Section 3 gives a view on the
remaining potential of Bridgman's ideas on operational analysis
for philosophy of science today.

Ordinary Objects,0.8078173995018005,0.3438949882984161,"

Our everyday experiences present us with a wide array of objects: dogs
and cats, tables and chairs, trees and their branches, and so forth.
These sorts of ordinary objects may seem fairly unproblematic in
comparison to entities like numbers, propositions, tropes, holes,
points of space, and moments of time. Yet, on closer inspection, they
are at least as puzzling, if not more so. Reflection on Michelangelo’s
David and the piece of marble of which it is made threatens
to lead to the surprising conclusion that these would have to be two
different objects occupying the same location and sharing all of their
parts. Reflection on the availability of microphysical explanations
for events that we take to be caused by ordinary objects threatens to
lead to the conclusion that ordinary objects—if they do
exist—never themselves cause anything to happen. Reflection
on the possibility of alternative conceptual schemes that “carve
up the world” in radically different ways makes our own
conception of which objects there are seem intolerably arbitrary.
Taken together, the various puzzles that arise in connection with
ordinary objects make a powerful case for their elimination.
And, in many cases, what seem to be the best responses to these
puzzles require the postulation of legions of objects that we fail to
notice despite their being right before our eyes.

In §1, I articulate a variety of ways of departing from an
ordinary, conservative conception of which objects there are, either
by eliminating ordinary objects or by permitting more objects than we
would ordinarily take to exist. In §2, I examine the puzzles and
arguments that are meant to motivate these departures. In §3, I
examine some arguments against eliminative and permissive views.
Finally, in §4, I turn from the question of which objects exist
to the question of which objects exist fundamentally.

Origen,0.5821289420127869,0.19298382103443146,"


Origen (c. 185–c. 253) was a Christian exegete and theologian,
who made copious use of the allegorical method in his commentaries,
and (though later considered a heretic) laid the foundations of
philosophical theology for the church. He was taught by a certain
Ammonius, whom the majority of scholars identify as Ammonius Saccas,
the teacher of Plotinus; many believe, however, that the external
evidence will not allow us to identify him with the Origen whom
Plotinus knew as a colleague. He was certainly well-instructed in
philosophy and made use of it as an ancillary to the exposition and
harmonization of scripture. This was the task that he undertook in
most of his extant writings, and the more systematic theology is
founded on the ecclesiastical doctrines of the Trinity, the
incarnation, salvation after death and the inerrancy of scripture.


Origen was the first Christian to speak of three
“hypostases” in the Trinity and to use the term
homoousios (though only by analogy) of the relation between
the second of these hypostases and the first. The Father, or first
person, is nevertheless the only one who is autotheos, God in
the fullest sense, whereas the Son is his dunamis or power
and the Spirit a dependent being, operative only in the elect. All
three are eternal and incorporeal, the Son being known as Wisdom in
relation to the Father and Logos (reason, word) in relation to the
world. In this capacity he is the shepherd of rational beings the
logikoi, who, according to his later critics, were said in
his lost writings to have been in origin incorporeal beings coeval
with the world if not eternal, and currently imprisoned in material
bodies only because of a cooling in their love. It is not so easy to
demonstrate from his extant works that he held the material world in
such contempt, though he certainly holds it to be created out of
nothing and suspects that the concept of matter is philosophically
redundant.  Souls, in his view, are sent down into bodies (perhaps
never more than once, though again some critics impute to him a
doctrine of transmigration or chronic falling away from bliss). The
soul remains indefeasibly free in its choices, and the misuse of this
freedom is the cause of its captivity to the devil.


The deliverance of the soul is effected by the incarnation of the
Logos, or second person of the Trinity, who assumes real body but
remains fully God. His death on the Cross is a ransom to the devil,
and his resurrection prefigures that of the saints, though he seems to
imagine the body after death, in Platonic terms, as a tenuous vehicle
of the soul. Scholars differ as to whether he envisages a final
absorption of the body into incorporeal spirit. It is clear that he
expects the vast majority of souls to endure a fiery purification
after death, and that no soul will be excluded by God’s will from this
purgatory. While he thinks it possible that some may be too debauched
by their sins to repent, he also opines that the devil himself will at
last make peace with God, though he cannot attain beatitude. In the
present life, an anticipation of bliss in the presence of Christ can
be enjoyed by the exegete who has fully mastered the spiritual meaning
of the scriptures. These are the word of God to us because Christ the
word is ubiquitously present in them, investing them with a threefold
sense as he himself assumed body, soul and spirit for our sake in his
sojourn on earth.

Original Position,0.4650269746780396,0.699518620967865,"


The original position is a central feature of John Rawls's social
contract account of justice, “justice as fairness,” set
forth in A Theory of Justice (TJ). It is
designed to be a fair and impartial point of view that is to be adopted
in our reasoning about fundamental principles of justice. In
taking up this point of view, we are to imagine ourselves in the
position of free and equal persons who jointly agree upon and commit
themselves to principles of social and political justice. The
main distinguishing feature of the original position is “the veil
of ignorance”: to insure impartiality of judgment, the parties
are deprived of all knowledge of their personal characteristics and
social and historical circumstances. They do know of certain
fundamental interests they all have, plus general facts about
psychology, economics, biology, and other social and natural
sciences. The parties in the original position are presented with
a list of the main conceptions of justice drawn from the tradition of
social and political philosophy, and are assigned the task of choosing
from among these alternatives the conception of justice that best
advances their interests in establishing conditions that enable them to
effectively pursue their final ends and fundamental interests. 
Rawls contends that the most rational choice for the parties in the
original position are two principles of justice: The first
guarantees the equal basic rights and liberties needed to secure the
fundamental interests of free and equal citizens and to pursue a wide
range of conceptions of the good. The second principle provides
fair equality of educational and employment opportunities enabling all
to fairly compete for powers and positions of office; and it secures
for all a guaranteed minimum of all-purpose means (including income and
wealth) individuals need to pursue their interests and to maintain
their self-respect as free and equal persons.

cultural and aesthetic critic, educator, politician and editor of the
influential journal, Revista de Occidente, he has written on
a broad range of themes and issues. Among his many books are:
Meditations on Quixote (1914), Invertebrate Spain
(1921), The Theme of Our Time (1923), Ideas on the
Novel (1925), The Dehumanization of Art (1925), What
is Philosophy? (1929), The Revolt of the Masses (1930),
En Torno a Galileo [Man and Crisis] (1933),
History as a System (1935), Man and People
(1939–40), The Origin of Philosophy (1943), The
Idea of Principle in Leibnitz and the Evolution of Deductive
Theory (1948). In addition to these books, he also wrote hundreds
of essays and newspaper and magazine articles, the most important of
which are collected in twelve volumes, several of which have been
translated into English, French and German. His major writings reveal
an intellectual development that traversed the life-world experiences
articulated in the perspectives of phenomenology, historicism and
existentialism.

Ortega's perception of human life as fundamental reality and as a
“happening”, his analysis of the ontological distinction
between “being” and “authentic being”, his
description of the intersubjective interaction of the “I”
and “Others” in the social world, his concepts of
“generation”, “contemporaries” and
“co-evals”, and his ideas of “perspectivism”,
“vital” and “historical reason”, all combine
to broaden and advance his philosophy of human social and historical
realities. Through these intellectual orientations, Ortega became
concerned with the epistemological status of historical knowledge, and
approached the critical philosophy of history as the interpenetration
of philosophical and historical attitudes. Critical philosophy of
history thus refers to the position that characterizes the world we
know and in which we act as a product of human activity and mind.
Accordingly, Ortega represented the “modern” reflective
thinker who approached history from philosophy, and whose theories of
history as a source of human knowledge have epitomized the tendency to
connect concepts of historical temporality and mind. He challenged
positivist approaches to history and contributed an important aspect
to the modern concept of history: the tenet that there is connection
and meaning in human history which emanates from a principle of
continuity inherent in individual human lives.

Property and Ownership,0.4621383547782898,0.7470982074737549,"


Property is a general term for rules governing access to and control
of land and other material resources. Because these rules are disputed,
both in regard to their general shape and in regard to their particular
application, there are interesting philosophical issues about the
justification of property. Modern philosophical discussions focus
mostly on the issue of the justification of private property
rights (as opposed to common or collective property). ‘Private
property’ refers to a kind of system that allocates particular
objects like pieces of land to particular individuals to use and manage
as they please, to the exclusion of others (even others who have a
greater need for the resources) and to the exclusion also of any
detailed control by society. Though these exclusions make the idea of
private property seem problematic, philosophers have often argued that
it is necessary for the ethical development of the individual, or for
the creation of a social environment in which people can prosper as
free and responsible agents.

Pacifism,0.3906568288803101,0.7113698720932007,"


Pacifism is a commitment to peace and opposition to war. Our
ordinary language allows a diverse set of beliefs and commitments to be
held together under the general rubric of pacifism. This article will
explain the family resemblance among the variety of pacifisms. It will
locate pacifism within deontological and consequentialist approaches to
ethics. And it will consider and reply to objections to pacifism.


The word “pacifism” is derived from the word
“pacific,” which means “peace making” [Latin,
paci- (from pax) meaning “peace”
and  -ficus meaning “making”]. Pacifism in
the West appears to begin with Christianity. Perhaps the most famous
use of the word pacifism is found in the Sermon on the Mount
(Matthew 5), where Jesus claims that the
“peacemakers” are blessed. In this passage, the Greek word
eirenopoios is translated into Latin as pacifici,
which means those who work for peace. The Greek eirenopoios is
derived from the Greek eirênê [peace] in
conjunction with poiesis [to make].
 Philosophical discussions of pacifism have clarified the concept
by distinguishing the more general commitment to nonviolence from a
narrower anti-war position. Pacifism is further defined through its
dialectical relation to the idea of justified violence that is found
in the Western just war tradition, with many locating pacifism on a
continuum for assessing the morality of war that includes realism,
just war theory, and pacifism. Indeed, there is an ongoing debate
about the proper relation between just war theory and pacifism that
focuses on the question of whether the just war theory begins with a
pacifist presumption against war. Some authors (May, for example) have
used the just war theory to derive a version of pacifism described as
“contingent pacifism” or “just war pacifism.”


Some have tried to distinguish “pacific-ism” from
pacifism, where pacific-ism is a commitment to peace and peacefulness
that is not strictly opposed to war while pacifism is a more
principled or absolute rejection of violence. But this distinction is
not widely accepted (although Dower has employed it recently). William
James used the term “pacific-ism” in 1910 to describe his
rejection of militarism. The shorter term, “pacifism,” has
become more common in English usage during the 20th Century
to describe a variety of views that are critical of war. 


Generally pacifism is thought to be a principled rejection of war and
killing. Oddly enough, the term pacifism has occasionally been used to
describe a pragmatic commitment to using war to create peace. Thus
some who called themselves “pacifists” (for example,
during the First World War) supported war as a suitable means toward
peace.  Richard Nixon once called himself a pacifist, even as he
continued to support the Vietnam War. This perverse use of pacifism is
connected to the way a term like “pacification” can be
employed in military usage to describe a violent process of
suppressing violence, as when an enemy territory is
“pacified” by killing or disabling the enemy. While George
Orwell and others have complained about such euphemistic descriptions
of violence, the just war tradition does hold that war can be a
suitable means to bring about peace.  Despite these complications,
pacifism generally connotes a commitment to making peace that rejects
violent means for obtaining this end. One reason to reject violent
means is the fact that might does not make right.  While violence can
destroy an enemy, victory does not amount to justification.


Pacifism, as it is understood in ordinary discourse today, includes a
variety of commitments on a continuum from an absolute adherence to
nonviolence in all actions to a more focused or minimal sort of
anti-warism. In contrast to the just war tradition, pacifism rejects
war as an acceptable means for obtaining peace. Pacifists will often
refuse to serve in the military. And some refuse to support political
and social systems that promote war by, for example, withholding their
taxes. Pacifism can be used to describe a commitment to nonviolence in
one's personal life that might include the attempt to cultivate
pacific virtues such as tolerance, patience, mercy, forgiveness, and
love. It might also be extended to include nonviolence toward all
sentient beings and thus result in a commitment to vegetarianism and
what Albert Schweitzer called, “reverence for life.” And
pacifism can be connected to a larger project of spiritual
transformation, as in Gandhi's commitment to ahimsa or
nonviolence.

Pain,0.7573257684707642,0.3851923644542694,"


Pain is the most prominent member of a class of sensations known as
bodily sensations, which includes itches, tickles, tingles, orgasms,
and so on. Bodily sensations are typically attributed to bodily
locations and appear to have features such as volume, intensity,
duration, and so on, that are ordinarily attributed to physical objects
or quantities. Yet these sensations are often thought to be logically
private, subjective, self-intimating, and the source of incorrigible
knowledge for those who have them. Hence there appear to be reasons
both for thinking that pains (along with other similar bodily
sensations) are physical objects or conditions that we perceive in body
parts, and for thinking that they are not. This paradox is one of the
main reasons why philosophers are especially interested in pain. One
increasingly popular but still controversial way to deal with this
paradox is to defend a perceptual or representational view of pain,
according to which feeling pain is in principle no different than
undergoing other standard perceptual processes like seeing, hearing,
touching, etc. But there are many who think that pains are not amenable
to such a treatment.

Panentheism,0.6815438270568848,0.5328367352485657,"

“Panentheism” is a constructed word composed of the
English equivalents of the Greek terms “pan”, meaning all,
“en”, meaning in, and “theism”, meaning God.
Panentheism considers God and the world to be inter-related with the
world being in God and God being in the world. It offers an
increasingly popular alternative to both traditional theism and
pantheism. Panentheism seeks to avoid either isolating God from the
world as traditional theism often does or identifying God with the
world as pantheism does. Traditional theistic systems emphasize the
difference between God and the world while panentheism stresses
God’s active presence in the world and the world’s
influence upon God. Pantheism emphasizes God’s presence in the
world but panentheism maintains the identity and significance of the
non-divine. Anticipations of panentheistic understandings of God have
occurred in both philosophical and theological writings throughout
history (Hartshorne and Reese 1953; J. Cooper, 2006). However, a rich
diversity of panentheistic understandings has developed in the past
two centuries primarily in Christian traditions responding to
scientific thought (Clayton and Peacocke 2004a). While panentheism
generally emphasizes God’s presence in the world without losing
the distinct identity of either God or the world, specific forms of
panenethism, drawing from different sources, explain the nature of the
relationship of God to the world in a variety of ways and come to
different conclusions about the nature of the significance of the
world for the identity of God.

Panpsychism,0.7267801761627197,0.4205540120601654,"

Panpsychism is the view that mentality is fundamental and ubiquitous
in the natural world. The view has a long and venerable history in
philosophical traditions of both East and West, and has recently
enjoyed a revival in analytic philosophy. For its proponents
panpsychism offers an attractive middle way between physicalism on the
one hand and dualism on the other. The worry with dualism—the
view that mind and matter are fundamentally different kinds of
thing—is that it leaves us with a radically disunified picture
of nature, and the deep difficulty of understanding how mind and brain
interact. And whilst physicalism offers a simple and unified vision of
the world, this is arguably at the cost of being unable to give a
satisfactory account of the emergence of human and animal
consciousness. Panpsychism, strange as it may sound on first hearing,
promises a satisfying account of the human mind within a unified
conception of nature.

Pantheism,0.6056329011917114,0.3386939764022827,"


The term ‘pantheism’ is a modern one, possibly first
appearing in the writing of the Irish freethinker John Toland (1705)
and constructed from the Greek roots pan (all) and
theos (God). But if not the name, the ideas themselves are
very ancient, and any survey of the history of philosophy will uncover
numerous pantheist or pantheistically inclined thinkers; although it
should also be noted that in many cases all that history has preserved
for us are second-hand reportings of attributed doctrines, any
reconstruction of which is too conjectural to provide much by way of
philosophical illumination.

At its most general, pantheism may be understood positively as the view
that God is identical with the cosmos, the view that there exists
nothing which is outside of God, or else negatively as the rejection of
any view that considers God as distinct from the universe.

However, given the complex and contested nature of the concepts
involved, there is insufficient consensus among philosophers to permit
the construction of any more detailed definition not open to serious
objection from some quarter or other. Moreover, the label is a
controversial one, where strong desires either to appropriate or to
reject it often serve only to obscure the actual issues, and it would
be a sad irony if pantheism revealed itself to be most like a
traditional religion in its sectarian disputes over just what counts as
‘true pantheism.’ Therefore pantheism should not be thought
of as a single codifiable position. Rather it should be understood as a
diverse family of distinct doctrines; many of whom would be
surprised—and, indeed, disconcerted—to find themselves regarded
as members of a single household. Further, since the concept has porous
and disputed boundaries there is no clear consensus on just who
qualifies, no definitive roll-call of past pantheists. Given this
situation the range of things that may be usefully said about
all pantheisms is perhaps limited, but nonetheless a variety
of concepts may be clarified, the nature of contentious issues
explored, and the range of possible options more precisely mapped
out.

Russell's Paradox,0.8661115169525146,0.7095797657966614,"


Russell’s paradox is the most famous of the logical or set-theoretical
paradoxes. Also known as the Russell-Zermelo paradox, the paradox
arises within naïve set theory by considering the set of all sets that
are not members of themselves. Such a set appears to be a member of
itself if and only if it is not a member of itself. Hence the
paradox. 

 Some sets, such as the set of all teacups, are not members of
 themselves. Other sets, such as the set of all non-teacups, are
 members of themselves. Call the set of all sets that are not members
 of themselves “R.” If R is a member of
 itself, then by definition it must not be a member of
 itself. Similarly, if R is not a member of itself, then by
 definition it must be a member of itself. 

Although also noticed by Ernst Zermelo, the contradiction was not thought to
 be  important until it was discovered independently
 by Bertrand Russell in the spring of
 1901. Since then, the paradox has prompted a great deal of work in
 logic, set theory and
 the
 philosophy and foundations of mathematics.

Simpson's Paradox,0.9542335867881776,0.4501350522041321,"

Consider the following story:


The label of each packet of FIXIT-Y-capsuls from the (imaginary)
Globalfixit Pharmacuticals Ltd. carries the following recommended
usage:

Recommended for males and females with Condition Y, but not
recommended for people with Condition Y.

As the fine print on the label goes on to explain:

clinical trials using FIXIT-Y showed a higher percentage of
recoveries from Y when men took it compared with the men who took
placebos, and similarly for women. But the group taking placebos in
the total population had higher recovery rates overall. You can trust
FIXIT to deliver evidence based pharmachology.

The company also markets FIXIT-Z-capsuls. The label on these carry
the advice that Z-capsuls are recommended for people who suffer from
Z, but not for males and not for females. As the fine print on the
label goes on to explain:

 Clinical trials using FIXIT-Z showed that people taking it had
higher recovery rates compared with those who took placebos. But both
males and females who took placebos had higher recovery rates compared
with the males and females who took FIXIT-Z. You can trust FIXIT to
deliver evidence based pharmachology.


While no capsul can be good for men and women, yet bad for people, or
good for people while being bad for men and women, the imagined data
(see below) on which FIXIT based its recommendations exhibit patterns
that are both arithmetically possible and turn up in actual data sets.
While there is nothing paradoxical about the existence of such data
from the standpoint of arithmetic, they do pose problems for practical
decision making (e.g., would you want to be treated with Fixit’s
capsuls in light of the reported clinical trials?), for heuristics
used in intuitive reasoning about probabilities, for inferences from
data to causal relations, and more generally, for philosophical
programs that aim to eliminate or reduce causation to regularities and
relations between probabilities.

The arithmetic, on which examples like FIXIT’s ill-judged
recommendations are based, is unproblematic. In summary it is based
on the fact that

An association between a pair of variables can consistently be
inverted in each subpopulation of a population when the population is
partitioned, and conversely, associations in each subpopulation can be
inverted when data are aggregated.


Call this principle Simpson’s Reversal of Inequalities. Failure to
recognise such reversals can lead to the abovementioned pitfalls about
what to do, what to believe, what to infer, and what causes what.
Even when actual and possible reversals are recognized, pitfalls
remain. On a positive note, once the possibilities of Simpson’s
Reversals are recognized, they provide a rich resource for
constructing causal models that help to explain many facts that appear
at first to be anomolous. Moreover, there is a test called the
“back-door criterion” (Pearl 1993) which can be used to help
resolve the question of whether one should base a decision on the
statistics from the aggregate population or from the partitioned
subpopulations.


Section 1 provides a brief history of Simpson’s Paradox, a statement
and diagnosis of the arithmetical structures that give rise to it, and
the boundary conditions for its occurrence. Section 2 examines
patterns of invalid reasoning that have their sources in Simpson’s
Paradox and possible ways of countering its effects. A particularly
important case where Simpson’s Paradox has been invalidly employed is
discussed in Section 3. It has been mooted that paradoxical data
provide counter-examples to the Sure Thing Principle in theories of
rational choice. Why such data appear to provide counter-examples to
the Sure Thing Principle is explained, and the appearance that they do
so is dispelled. Section 4 discusses the roles and implications of
paradoxical data for theories of causal inference and for analyses of
causal relations in terms of probabilities. While the conclusions of
this section are largely negative, Section 5 illustrates how
apparently paradoxical data can support causal models for the
evolution of traits that at first appear to be incompatible with a
setting in which natural selection disadvantages individuals that
exhibit the traits.

Skolem's Paradox,0.8963419795036316,0.7381888628005981,"


Skolem's Paradox involves a seeming conflict between two theorems
from classical logic. The Löwenheim-Skolem theorem says that if a
first-order theory has infinite models, then it has models whose
domains are only countable. Cantor's theorem says that some sets are
uncountable. Skolem's Paradox arises when we notice that the basic
principles of Cantorian set theory—i.e., the very principles used
to prove Cantor's theorem on the existence of uncountable
sets—can themselves be formulated as a collection of first-order
sentences. How can the very principles which prove the existence of
uncountable sets be satisfied by a model which is itself only
countable? How can a countable model satisfy the first-order sentence
which says that there are uncountably many mathematical
objects—e.g., uncountably many real numbers?


Philosophical discussion of this paradox has tended to focus on
three main questions. First, there's a purely mathematical question:
why doesn't Skolem's Paradox introduce an outright contradiction into
set theory? Second, there's a historical question. Skolem himself gave
a pretty good explanation as to why Skolem's Paradox doesn't constitute
a straightforward mathematical contradiction; why, then, did Skolem and
his contemporaries continue to find the paradox so philosophically
troubling? Finally there's a purely philosophical question: what, if
anything, does Skolem's Paradox tell us about our understanding of set
theory and/or about the semantics of set-theoretic language?

The Paradox of Suspense,0.7379574179649353,0.9250808954238892,"


The ultimate success of Hollywood blockbusters is dependent upon 
repeat viewings. Fans return to theaters to see films multiple times 
and buy DVDs so they can watch movies yet again. Although it is 
something of a received dogma in philosophy and psychology that 
suspense requires uncertainty, many of the biggest box office 
successes are action movies that fans claim to find suspenseful on 
repeated viewings. The conflict between the theory of suspense and 
the accounts of viewers generates a problem known as the paradox 
of suspense, which we can boil down to a simple question: If 
suspense requires uncertainty, how can a viewer who knows the outcome
still feel suspense? 


There is a related problem concerning “musical suspense”: How can one
can feel suspense in response to sonic movements with which one is 
intimately acquainted? Unlike paradigmatic suspense, musical suspense
is typically unaccompanied by fear. Accordingly, it is better 
described as mere tension. Given the controversy over the nature of 
the response to music, this entry will deal solely with the paradox of
suspense in regard to narrative artworks. 


I will consider four different solutions to the paradox of suspense: 
(1) the thought theory of entertained uncertainty, (2) the 
desire-frustration theory of suspense, (3) the 
moment-by-moment forgetting theory, and (4) the emotional 
misidentification view. The thought theory of entertained 
uncertainty explains the paradox by denying that actual 
uncertainty is necessary for suspense; instead, all that is required 
is for viewers to engage the fiction as they normally 
would—entertaining thoughts of the story as if they were 
undecided. The desire-frustration theory holds that 
uncertainty, entertained or actual, is not necessary for suspense. To
create suspense, one merely needs to frustrate a desire to affect the
outcome of an imminent event. The moment-by-moment forgetting 
view is the position that while viewers are immersed in a fictional 
scenario, they effectively cannot remember the outcome. The 
emotional misidentification view holds that it is impossible 
for viewers who know the outcome to feel suspense, and the best 
explanation of the claims of audiences to the contrary is that 
viewers must be confusing their actual fear and anxiety with what 
they take to be suspense. 


Rather than provide an exhaustive survey of the literature on 
suspense, in what follows I discuss representatives of the four types
of solutions to the paradox. I begin with a description of the 
paradox of suspense and then explain which claims the various 
solutions reject.

Almost everything that we know about Zeno of Elea is to be found in
the opening pages of Plato’s Parmenides. There we learn
that Zeno was nearly 40 years old when Socrates was a young man, say
20. Since Socrates was born in 469 BC we can estimate a birth date for
Zeno around 490 BC. Beyond this, really all we know is that he was
close to Parmenides (Plato reports the gossip that they were lovers
when Zeno was young), and that he wrote a book of paradoxes defending
Parmenides’ philosophy. Sadly this book has not survived, and
what we know of his arguments is second-hand, principally through
Aristotle and his commentators (here we draw particularly on
Simplicius, who, though writing a thousand years after Zeno,
apparently possessed at least some of his book). There were apparently
40 ‘paradoxes of plurality’, attempting to show that
ontological pluralism—a belief in the existence of many things
rather than only one—leads to absurd conclusions; of these
paradoxes only two definitely survive, though a third argument can
probably be attributed to Zeno. Aristotle speaks of a further four
arguments against motion (and by extension change generally), all of
which he gives and attempts to refute. In addition Aristotle
attributes two other paradoxes to Zeno. Sadly again, almost none of
these paradoxes are quoted in Zeno’s original words by their
various commentators, but in paraphrase.

By “paradox” one usually means a statement claiming
something which goes beyond (or even against) ‘common
opinion’ (what is usually believed or held). Paradoxes form a
natural object of philosophical investigation ever since the origins
of rational thought; they have been invented as part of complex
arguments and as tools for refuting philosophical theses (think of the
celebrated paradoxes credited to Zeno of Elea, concerning motion, the
continuum, the opposition between unity and plurality, or of the
arguments entangling the notions of truth and vagueness, credited to
the Megarian School, and Eubulides of Miletus). Paradoxes—termed
as Insolubilia—form also a substantial part of logical
and philosophical investigations during the Middle Ages.

This entry concentrates on the emergence of non-trivial logical themes
and notions from the discussion on paradoxes from the beginning of the
20th century until 1945, and attempts to assess their importance for
the development of contemporary logic. Paradoxes involving
 vagueness,
 knowledge,
 belief,

A terminological warning is in order. The word “antinomy”
is used below as alternative to, and synonymous with,

Parenthood and Procreation,0.5088913440704346,0.8157702684402466,"


The ethics of parenthood and procreation apply not only to daily
acts of decision-making by parents and prospective procreators, but
also to law, public policy, and medicine. Two recent social and
technological shifts make this topic especially pressing. First,
changing family demographics in North America and Europe mean that
children are increasingly reared in blended families, by single
parents, or by same-sex partners, prompting questions of who should be
considered a child's parent and what good parenting
requires. Second, the development and proliferation of
“Assisted Reproductive Technology” (ART) raises questions
concerning access to the technology, its permissibility, and its use to
enhance future children or prevent the birth of children with certain
conditions. Recent debate in ethics and political philosophy has
focused on the following questions:

Are there any procreative rights? If so, what are they? What, if
anything, limits them? When is it morally permissible to
procreate?  What may procreators permissibly aim at in choosing
characteristics of potential children?  What are the moral
constraints on the means of procreation?
What are the grounds of parenthood?  In what respects is
parenthood a biological or natural relationship, and in what respects a
social one?
What are the scope and limits of parental rights and
responsibilities? What must parents provide for their children? 
How should their parental responsibilities weigh against other
obligations?  What should parents be allowed to do, and when may,
or must, public agencies intervene?  What, if anything, does
society owe parents?



In the following entry, we divide these questions into three
sequential stages: the ethics of procreation (creating a child), to
which we devote two sections, and then becoming parents (acquiring
parental rights and responsibilities), and being parents (holding and
discharging parental rights and responsibilities).

Parmenides,0.6543185710906982,0.026129614561796192,"

Parmenides of Elea, active in the earlier part of the 5th c. BCE,
authored a difficult metaphysical poem that has earned him a
reputation as early Greek philosophy’s most profound and challenging
thinker. His philosophical stance has typically been understood as at
once extremely paradoxical and yet crucial for the broader development
of Greek natural philosophy and metaphysics. He has been seen as a
metaphysical monist (of one stripe or another) who so challenged the
naïve cosmological theories of his predecessors that his major
successors among the Presocratics were all driven to develop more
sophisticated physical theories in response to his arguments. The
difficulties involved in the interpretation of his poem have resulted
in disagreement about many fundamental questions concerning his
philosophical views, such as: whether he actually was a monist and, if
so, what kind of monist he was; whether his system reflects a critical
attitude toward earlier thinkers such as the Milesians, Pythagoreans,
and Heraclitus, or whether he was motivated simply by more strictly
logical concerns, such as the paradox of negative existentials that
Bertrand Russell detected at the heart of his thought; whether he
considered the world of our everyday awareness, with its vast
population of entities changing and affecting one another in all
manner of ways, to be simply an illusion, and thus whether the lengthy
cosmological portion of his poem represented a genuine attempt to
understand this world at all. This entry aims to provide an overview
of Parmenides’ work and of some of the major interpretive approaches
advanced over the past few decades. It concludes by suggesting that
understanding his thought and his place in the development of early
Greek philosophy requires taking due account of the fundamental modal
distinctions that he was the first to articulate and explore with any
precision.

Pascal's Wager,0.7013644576072693,0.8244170546531677,"


“Pascal’s Wager” is the name given to an argument
due to Blaise Pascal for believing, or for at least taking steps to
believe, in God. The name is somewhat misleading, for in a single
section of his Pensées, Pascal apparently presents at
least three such arguments, each of which might be called a
‘wager’—it is only the final of these that is
traditionally referred to as “Pascal’s Wager”. We
find in it the extraordinary confluence of several important strands
of thought: the justification of theism; probability theory and
decision theory, used here for almost the first time in history;
pragmatism; voluntarism (the thesis that belief is a matter of the
will); and the use of the concept of infinity. 


We will begin with some brief stage-setting: some historical
background, some of the basics of decision theory, and some of the
exegetical problems that the Pensées pose. Then we will
follow the text to extract three main arguments. The bulk of the
literature addresses the third of these arguments, as will the bulk of
our discussion here. Some of the more technical and scholarly aspects
of our discussion will be relegated to lengthy footnotes, to which
there are links for the interested reader. All quotations are from
§233 of Pensées (1910, Trotter translation), the
‘thought’ whose heading is
“Infinite—nothing”.

Paternalism,0.4778251945972442,0.8883858919143677,"

Paternalism is the interference of a state or an individual with
another person, against their will, and defended or motivated by a
claim that the person interfered with will be better off or protected
from harm. The issue of paternalism arises with respect to
restrictions by the law such as anti-drug legislation, the compulsory
wearing of seatbelts, and in medical contexts by the withholding of
relevant information concerning a patient’s condition by
physicians. At the theoretical level it raises questions of how
persons should be treated when they are less than fully rational.

Patriotism,0.4286070168018341,0.6504911780357361,"

Patriotism raises questions of the sort philosophers
characteristically discuss: How is patriotism to be defined? How is it
related to similar attitudes, such as nationalism? What is its moral
standing: is it morally valuable or perhaps even mandatory, or is it
rather a stance we should avoid? Yet until a few decades ago,
philosophers used to show next to no interest in the subject. The
article on patriotism in the Historical Dictionary of
Philosophy, reviewing the use of the term from the
16th century to our own times, gives numerous references,
but they are mostly to authors who were not philosophers. Moreover, of
the few well known philosophers cited, only one, J. G. Fichte, gave
the subject more than a passing reference – and most of what
Fichte had to say actually pertains to nationalism, rather than
patriotism (see Busch and Dierse 1989).

This changed in the 1980s. The change was due, in part, to the revival
of communitarianism, which came in response to the individualistic,
liberal political and moral philosophy epitomized by John Rawls’
Theory of Justice (1971); but it was also due to the
resurgence of nationalism in several parts of the world. The beginning
of this change was marked by Andrew Oldenquist’s account of
morality as a matter of various loyalties, rather than abstract
principles and ideals (Oldenquist 1982), and Alasdair
MacIntyre’s argument that patriotism is a central moral virtue
(MacIntyre 1984). Largely in response to MacIntyre, some philosophers
have defended constrained or deflated versions of patriotism (Baron
1989, Nathanson 1989, Primoratz 2002). Others have argued against
patriotism of any sort (Gomberg 1990, McCabe 1997, Keller 2005). There
is now a lively philosophical debate about the moral credentials of
patriotism that shows no signs of abating. A parallel discussion in
political philosophy concerns the kind of patriotism that might
provide an alternative to nationalism as the ethos of a stable,
well-functioning polity.

Renaissance, Francesco Patrizi of Cherso (1529-1597) was a leading
critic of the dominant Aristotelianism of the times. Not to be
confused with the earlier humanist and political theoretician,
Francesco Patrizi of Siena (1413-1494), Patrizi of Cherso focused his
attention on a wide variety of philosophical, scientific, artistic and
literary issues, providing in his “New Philosophy” a major
alternative to earlier schools of thought and a model which later
thinkers such as Galileo Galilei no doubt found valuable in developing
the mathematized physics which would prove the dominant force in the
rise of early modern science. In addition, Patrizi's
research into the history of ancient and medieval philosophical sources
as an essential part of his method for establishing the legitimacy of
his own position would make those texts available to his contemporaries
in a way they had never been before and serve as a model for future
generations of scholars. It also emphasized the centrality of the
study of the history of philosophy as an integral part of engaging in
philosophical investigation in its own right.

Paul of Venice,0.6725049018859863,0.2456953823566437,"

Paul of Venice was the most important Italian thinker of his times,
and one of the most prominent and interesting logicians of the Middle
Ages. His philosophical theories (culminating in a metaphysics of
essences which states the ontological and epistemological primacy of
universals over any other kind of beings) are the final and highest
result of the preceding realistic tradition of thought. He fully
developed the new form of realism started up by Wyclif and his Oxonian
followers in the last decades of the 14th century, and
renewed Burley’s attacks against nominalistic views. The metaphysical
convictions at the basis of his philosophy are an original version of
the most fundamental theses of Duns Scotus (viz. univocity of being;
existence of universal forms outside the mind, which are at the same
time identical with and different from their own individuals; real
identity and formal distinction between essence and being; thisness as
the principle of individuation; real distinction among the ten
categories). But Paul puts much more stress on the ontological
presuppositions and entailments of the doctrine. Simultaneously, he
was open to influences from many other directions, as he held in due
consideration also the positions of authors such as Albert the Great,
Thomas Aquinas, and Giles of Rome, and critically discussed the
doctrines of the main Nominalists of the 14th century,
namely William Ockham, John Buridan, and Marsilius of Inghen,
sometimes playing mutually incompatible theses against each other.
This contributes to making his works stimulating and enriching from an
historical point of view, but also makes it difficult to grasp his own
ideas in their relationships and unity. These reflections help us to
explain why for about one hundred and fifty years Paul was
erroneously, but unanimously, believed to be an Ockhamist in
logic and metaphysics and an Averroist in psychology and
epistemology.

Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) was the founder of American
pragmatism (after about 1905 called by Peirce
“pragmaticism” in order to differentiate his views from
those of William James, John Dewey, and others, which were being
labelled “pragmatism”), a theorist of logic, language,
communication, and the general theory of signs (which was often called
by Peirce “semeiotic”), an extraordinarily prolific
logician (mathematical and general), and a developer of an
evolutionary, psycho-physically monistic metaphysical
system. Practicing geodesy and chemistry in order to earn a living, he
nevertheless considered scientific philosophy, and especially logic,
to be his true calling, his real vocation. In the course of his
polymathic researches, he wrote voluminously on an exceedingly wide
range of topics, ranging from mathematics, mathematical logic,
physics, geodesy, spectroscopy, and astronomy, on the one hand (that
of mathematics and the physical sciences), to psychology,
anthropology, history, and economics, on the other (that of the
humanities and the social sciences).

Peirce's Deductive Logic,0.9182472229003906,0.6749905943870544,"
There are two different ways to approach Peirce's deductive logic
(we hereafter use “logic” to refer to deductive
logic). One is to focus on how the main topics of logic evolved and
were shaped within Peirce's framework.  This ‘bottom-up’
approach not only provides us with genuine insight into Peirce's
logic, but also contributes to another, even greater body of
research—Peirce's philosophy.  However, the bottom-up method
faces a serious obstacle because the enormous nexus of Peircean ideas
is difficult to unravel and separate.
The other approach is to highlight Peirce's
achievements in logic and to locate Peirce's contributions
within the context of modern logic.  This ‘top-down’ approach
has merit both in its defined scope and in its appeal to those who are
interested in the development of logic in general.  On the other hand,
the top-down approach carries with it the risk of isolating Peirce's
logic from his greater philosophy.
The entry aims to mix these two methods so that we may present
Peirce's logic both for Peirce scholars and for those interested in
the development of modern logic. Without getting lost in Peirce's
ambitious blueprint for philosophy, we will connect his main views in logic
within his own philosophy so that a coherent picture of Peirce's logic
may emerge.  We single out the common theme of Peirce's various
contributions to modern logic, namely, to extend logic, as
characterized by the following three different dimensions:

extension of the scope of formalism: from propositional to
predicate logic (discussed in Section 2),
extension of kinds of systems: from symbolic to diagrammatic
systems (discussed in Section 3), and
extension of semantic values: from two-valued to three-valued
logic (discussed in the supplement
 Peirce's Three-Valued Logic).


Though these three contributions of Peirce's logic have been discussed
in the literature (see generally Houser et al. 1997), the main goal of the
present entry is to provide the reader with a wide perspective by
outlining themes which run through his three ambitious enterprises.
By carefully examining how Peirce proposed each of the three historical
achievements, we find that Peirce was determined to carry
out an important mission—to extend the horizon of logic.

Peirce's Theory of Signs,0.8578165769577026,0.4815278947353363,"


Peirce's Sign Theory, or Semiotic, is an account of signification,
representation, reference and meaning. Although sign theories have a
long history, Peirce's accounts are distinctive and innovative for
their breadth and complexity, and for capturing the importance of
interpretation to signification. For Peirce, developing a
thoroughgoing theory of signs was a central philosophical and
intellectual preoccupation. The importance of semiotic for Peirce is
wide ranging. As he himself said, “[…] it has never been
in my power to study anything,—mathematics, ethics, metaphysics,
gravitation, thermodynamics, optics, chemistry, comparative anatomy,
astronomy, psychology, phonetics, economics, the history of science,
whist, men and women, wine, metrology, except as a study of
semiotic” (SS 1977, 85–6). Peirce also treated sign
theory as central to his work on logic, as the medium for inquiry and
the process of scientific discovery, and even as one possible means
for 'proving' his pragmatism. Its importance in Peirce's philosophy,
then, cannot be overestimated.


Across the course of his intellectual life, Peirce continually
returned to and developed his ideas about signs and semiotic and there
are three broadly delineable accounts: a concise Early Account from
the 1860s; a complete and relatively neat Interim Account developed
through the 1880s and 1890s and presented in 1903; and his
speculative, rambling, and incomplete Final Account developed between
1906 and 1910. The following entry examines these three accounts, and
traces the changes that led Peirce to develop earlier accounts and
generate new, more complex, sign theories. However, despite these
changes, Peirce's ideas on the basic structure of signs and
signification remain largely uniform throughout his
developments. Consequently, it is useful to begin with an account of
the basic structure of signs according to Peirce.

The Disjunctive Theory of Perception,0.7405140995979309,0.3956288397312164,"


Perceptual experiences are often divided into the following three
broad categories: veridical perceptions, illusions, and
hallucinations.  For example, when one has a visual experience as of a
red object, it may be that one is really seeing an object and its red
colour (veridical perception), that one is seeing a green object
(illusion), or that one is not seeing an object at all
(hallucination). Many maintain that the same account should be given
of the nature of the conscious experience that occurs in each of these
three cases. Those who hold a disjunctive theory of perception deny
this. Disjunctivists typically reject the claim that the same kind of
experience is common to all three cases because they hold views about
the nature of veridical perception that are inconsistent with it.


Disjunctivists are often naïve realists, who hold that when one
perceives the world, the mind-independent objects of perception, such
as tables and trees, are constituents of one's experience. In other
cases, such as hallucinations, it seems out of the question that such
objects are constituents of one's experience. It follows that on a
naïve realist view, the veridical perceptions and hallucinations
in question have a different nature: the former have mind-independent
objects as constituents, and the latter do not.

Perfectionism has acquired a number of meanings in contemporary
moral and political philosophy. The term is used to refer to an
account of a good human life, an account of human well-being, a moral
theory, and an approach to politics. Historically, perfectionism
is associated with ethical theories that characterize the human good in
terms of the development of human nature. Writers as diverse as
Aristotle, Aquinas, Spinoza, Marx, and T.H. Green are perfectionists in
this sense.


Speaking generally, perfectionist writers advance an objective
account of the good and then develop an account of ethics and/or
politics that is informed by this account of the good. Different
perfectionist writers propose different accounts of the good and arrive
at different ethical and political conclusions. But all
perfectionists defend an account of the good that is objective in the
sense that it identifies states of affairs, activities, and/or
relationships as good in themselves and not good in virtue of the fact
that they are desired or enjoyed by human beings.

Personal Relationship Goods,0.4982160031795502,0.7737918496131897,"

Over the past decades, political philosophers and applied ethicists
have been increasingly interested in the value of personal
relationships. The goods they generate—or, perhaps, of which
they consist—are obviously important, both instrumentally and
non-instrumentally, for how well individuals’ lives go on
various accounts of what makes a life good: They are highly desired by
most people, can bring a lot of pleasure and joy and, at least some of
them—such as friendship or love—have objective value. More
recently, these goods have also been said to be relevant to
determining individuals’ duties and even rights. In particular,
there are several reasons to be concerned with their distribution:
Personal relationship goods represent a significant and
non-substitutable component of individuals’ well-being, are a
significant kind of personal resource as well as a major determinant
of individuals’ opportunities.

It seems important to ensure that all individuals enjoy these goods to
a sufficient, or perhaps equal, degree. Theories of
justice—which have for a long time been mostly preoccupied with
the distribution of material goods—started to show interest in
the distribution of personal relationship goods. And yet, the claims
that there are duties of justice to distribute them and that states
are (amongst) the bearers of such duties raise several problems.

Joane Petrizi (12th century)—the most significant Georgian
medieval philosopher—devoted intensive work to neo-Platonic
philosophy. He translated Nemesius of Emesa's On the Nature of
Man into Georgian, a work which in that day attracted considerable
attention. Of particular importance is his Georgian translation of
Proclus's Elementatio theologica, to which he also wrote a
step-by-step commentary. Petrizi's commentary on the Elementatio
theologica represents a significant effort at reception inasmuch
as the Georgian philosopher interprets the work immanently, that is, on
the basis of Proclus's philosophy itself. Therefore, he definitely
deserves to receive increased attention in presentations and
reconstructions of the philosophy of Proclus, and especially in
research on medieval Proclus commentaries. Up to now, the standard
editions of the Elementatio theologica only mention Petrizi's
Proclus work in passing (if at all), or even criticize it unjustly
(Dodds, pp. xli–xlii, 343; cf. in more detail Iremadze,
Konzeptionen, pp. 225–231). Research on the Georgian
translation and interpretation of the Elementatio theologica
in the context of Byzantine and Latin Proclus
interpreters—Nicholas of Methone (12th century),
Berthold of Moosburg (14th century), Henry Bate of Mechelen
(13th century)—will close this gap in Proclus
research. Furthermore, the reception by Byzantine philosophers of the
11th and 12th centuries (Psellos, Italos) should
not be overlooked.

Phenomenology,0.7043106555938721,0.4452835321426392,"


Phenomenology is the study of structures of consciousness as
experienced from the first-person point of view. The central structure
of an experience is its intentionality, its being directed toward
something, as it is an experience of or about some object. An
experience is directed toward an object by virtue of its content or
meaning (which represents the object) together with appropriate
enabling conditions.


Phenomenology as a discipline is distinct from but related to other
key disciplines in philosophy, such as ontology, epistemology, logic,
and ethics. Phenomenology has been practiced in various guises for
centuries, but it came into its own in the early 20th century in the
works of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty and others.
Phenomenological issues of intentionality, consciousness, qualia, and
first-person perspective have been prominent in recent philosophy of
mind.

The Phenomenology of the Munich and Göttingen Circles,0.6975212097167969,0.4863917231559754,"
 

In the first decades of the twentieth century, the members of the
so-called “Munich and Göttingen circles” of
phenomenology made important contributions to the philosophy of mind,
the philosophy of language, the philosophy of action, epistemology,
social philosophy, the philosophy of values and ontology. Some of the
most prominent members of these circles are (in alphabetical order):
Theodor Conrad, Hedwig Conrad-Martius, Johannes Daubert, August
Gallinger, Moritz Geiger, Roman Ingarden, Herbert Leyendecker, Paul
Linke, Alexander Pfänder, Adolf Reinach, Hermann Ritzel, Wilhelm
Schapp, Kurt Stavenhagen, and Edith Stein. The ideas of these authors
were influenced by such thinkers as Henri Bergson, Bernard Bolzano,
Franz Brentano, Theodor Lipps, Anton Marty, Alexius Meinong,
and—to an even more significant degree—by the work of
Edmund Husserl.


Some of the most original insights provided by what has also been
characterized as “early phenomenology” concern the notion
of intentionality, i.e., the feature of some mental states by means of
which they are directed to objects and states of affairs. Several
members of the Munich and Göttingen circles claimed that there are
radically different kinds of intentional acts and states, which cannot
be reduced to a unitary genus. For instance, it was argued that the act
of perceiving a state of affairs and the act of
meaning it with a linguistic expression are not of the same
genus and that both acts are further distinct from informing
someone about this state of affairs or from enjoying it.
Moreover, some of these authors maintained that all these acts or
experiences assume different shapes if they are performed by an
individual or by a collective subject.


Early phenomenologists understood the investigation of mental
experiences as part of a general theory of objects or ontology, and
their contributions thereto share some common traits. In particular, it
was usually assumed that objects and facts exist independently of
anyone’s beliefs, mental states or conceptual schemes and that
they instantiate essential properties. The two main categories of
phenomenological ontology, to which several members of both circles
devoted extensive research, are that of objects and states of
affairs.

Philip the Chancellor was an influential figure in a number of
different circles in the first half of the thirteenth century. He
enjoyed a long though rather turbulent ecclesiastical career and was
famous for his sermons and his lyric poetry, the latter of which has
received attention by a number of musicologists in recent years. In the
areas of philosophy and theology, his major work, Summa de
bono, which was composed sometime in the 1220s–1230s, was a
ground-breaking achievement in many ways. Philip was one of the first
to organize a Summa around a central foundational principle,
the notion of the good. Summa de bono also contains most
likely the earliest treatment of a topic that rose to prominence in the
later medieval period, the doctrine of the transcendentals. Elements of
Philip's theory of action drew comments from such later notables as
Albert the Great. Summa de bono was a well-respected and
influential work in the thirteenth century.

Philodemus,0.6105505228042603,0.0,"


Philodemus of Gadara (ca. 110–ca. 30 BCE) was an Epicurean
philosopher and epigrammatist who, having studied in the Epicurean
school at Athens led by Zeno of Sidon, moved to Italy, probably in the
70's BCE. There he may have lived in the Greek town of Naples,
and perhaps also in Rome. Some of Philodemus' poems, praised by
Cicero, were preserved in the Palatine Anthology, and these
were all that was known of his writing until the discovery in the
mid-18th century of a trove of papyrus manuscripts in the
ruins of a grand villa in Herculaneum, buried by the eruption of
Vesuvius in 79 CE, the majority of which were philosophical works of
his.


A self-proclaimed interpreter of Epicurus and the first generation
of Epicureans, as well as the devoted follower of his master Zeno of
Sidon, Philodemus' claim on our attention does not rest on the
originality of his philosophical doctrine. There may have been scope
for such originality, especially in his approach to the liberal arts,
traditionally neglected or even deprecated by Epicureans. What we can
see in his work is the effort by a latter-day Epicurean to work out
positions which the school's founders may have put forward, but
which were no longer up to date in the context of continuing debate
among the Hellenistic schools. Further, he attempts to uphold a
particular view of Epicurean orthodoxy against rival Epicureans who had
a different interpretation of a number of positions of the school,
these too presumably developed in response to challenges and to
positions of other schools which had advanced the state of the
discussion in many areas. One battleground among these Epicurean rivals
was the use of Epicurean texts, the importance of collecting and
studying the entire corpus of the school's founders' works,
their philological and philosophical exegesis, and the place of
epitomes and compendia vis-à-vis the extensive and
detailed works of the corpus. This concern for authority in the
interpretation, upholding, and teaching of Epicurean orthodoxy feeds
into Philodemus' concern for the healthy conduct of his school,
for its life as a community of philosophers, both students and
teachers, studying Epicurean and other texts while trying to lead the
kind of philosophical life commended by the school.

Philolaus,0.6854739785194397,0.030770236626267437,"

Philolaus of Croton, in southern Italy, was a Greek
philosopher/scientist, who lived from ca. 470 to ca. 385 BC and was
thus a contemporary of Socrates. He is one of the three most prominent
figures in the Pythagorean tradition, born a hundred years after
Pythagoras himself and fifty years before Archytas. He wrote one book,
On Nature, which was probably the first book to be written by
a Pythagorean. There has been considerable controversy concerning the
20+ fragments which have been preserved in Philolaus' name. It is now
generally accepted that some eleven of the fragments come from his
genuine book. Other books were forged in Philolaus' name at a later
date, and the remaining fragments come from these spurious works.
Philolaus argues that the cosmos and everything in it are made up of
two basic types of things, limiters and unlimiteds. Unlimiteds are
continua undefined by any structure or quantity; they include the
traditional Presocratic material elements such as earth, air, fire and
water but also space and time. Limiters set limits in such unlimiteds
and include shapes and other structural principles. Limiters and
unlimiteds are not combined in a haphazard way but are subject to a
“fitting together” or “harmonia,” which can be
described mathematically. Philolaus' primary example of such a
harmonia of limiters and unlimiteds is a musical scale, in which the
continuum of sound is limited according to whole number ratios, so
that the octave, fifth, and fourth are defined by the ratios 2 : 1, 3
: 2 and 4 : 3, respectively. Since the whole world is structured
according to number, we only gain knowledge of the world insofar as we
grasp these numbers. The cosmos comes to be when the unlimited fire is
fitted together with the center of the cosmic sphere (a limiter) to
become the central fire. Philolaus was the precursor of Copernicus in
moving the earth from the center of the cosmos and making it a planet,
but in Philolaus' system it does not orbit the sun but rather the
central fire. The astronomical system is a significant attempt to try
to explain the phenomena but also has mythic and religious
significance. Philolaus presented a medical theory in which there was
a clear analogy between the birth of a human being and the birth of
the cosmos. The embryo is conceived of as composed of the hot and then
as drawing in cooling breath immediately upon birth, just as the
cosmos begins with the heat of the central fire, which then draws in
breath along with void and time from the unlimited. Philolaus posited
a strict hierarchy of psychic faculties, which allows him to
distinguish human beings from animals and plants. He probably believed
that the transmigrating soul was a harmonious arrangement of physical
elements located in the heart and that the body became ensouled when
the proper balance of hot and cold was established by the breathing of
the new-born infant. Philolaus' genuine book was one of the major
sources for Aristotle's account of Pythagorean philosophy. There is
controversy as to whether or not Aristotle's description of the
Pythagoreans as equating things with numbers is an accurate account of
Philolaus' view. Plato mentions Philolaus in the Phaedo and
adapts Philolaus' metaphysical scheme for his own purposes in the
Philebus.

Philo of Alexandria,0.4990127980709076,0.21415740251541127,"

Philo of Alexandria is a Jewish thinker who lived in Alexandria in the
first half of the first century BCE. Whether he really was a
philosopher is a question still debated at length. At the beginning of
the Roman Empire, especially for the Stoics and the Cynics, the
fundamental task of a philosopher was the construction of his own
self. A man who sought to improve himself had to first regulate his
own nature, controlling his passions and emotions and eliminating any
gap between theory and practice. He was thus supposed to approach the
perfection of a god. To the exact contrary of this attitude,
Philo’s purpose was to prove the oudeneia, the
ontological nothingness of human beings. In his opinion, the only way
to have real existence was to admit that one is nothing without the
help of God, who is the source of freedom, logos
(reason) and consciousness. He aimed
to be the best possible servant of the Revelation and of the text that
forms God’s Word. He accepted contradiction as a normal means of
expression, which serves as a possible explanation for the disordered
impression of his treatises. He was, however, neither ignorant nor
confused; rather, he consciously deconstructed the rationalist
patterns of Greek thought, which in his opinion served to affirm the
primacy of the self. He did not want to get rid of logos
but rather to place it clearly
within the unique perspective of divine transcendence. Though he felt
great admiration for Plato, his transcendence was not exactly
Platonic, but rather of a God both absolutely unknowable yet very
close to mankind. Nikiprowetzky (1977) inaugurated a new era in
Philonian studies by affirming the centrality of the Law in the
Philo’s thought. In this perspective, philosophy was the servant
of Revelation, a way to lend his exegesis a more universal impact by
drawing upon the categories of Greek logos
One of the purposes of our
presentation will be to give a plausible evaluation of the many images
and interpretations of Philo that we find in Philonian
scholarship.

Philo (159/8–84/3 BC) was the last known head of Plato's
Academy during its skeptical phase. Under his leadership, the Academics
abandoned the radical skepticism of Arcesilaus and Carneades (who
professed to live without rationally warranted beliefs) in favor of a
form of mitigated skepticism allowing for provisional beliefs that did
not claim certainty. But Philo himself seems to have gone a step
further in his controversial ‘Roman Books’, where he
rejected the Stoic definition of knowledge on which the
Academics' mitigated skepticism relied. The evidence suggests
that he proposed instead a weaker, fallibilist theory that allowed for
ordinary knowledge but did not support the theoretical dogmatism of the
Academics' philosophical rivals. By challenging the accepted
epistemological framework of the Hellenistic period, Philo thus
inadvertently helped to set the stage for the subsequent revival of
Platonism as a dogmatic tradition based on the interpretation of
Platonic doctrines. He is most widely known, however, as the teacher of
Cicero, through whose work Academic skepticism became known in the
Latin-reading world.

Holism and Nonseparability in Physics,0.9191086292266846,0.35002589225769043,"


It has sometimes been suggested that quantum phenomena exhibit a
characteristic holism or nonseparability, and that this distinguishes
quantum from classical physics. One puzzling quantum phenomenon arises
when one performs measurements on certain separated quantum
systems. The results of some such measurements regularly exhibit
patterns of statistical correlation that resist traditional causal
explanation. Some have held that it is possible to understand these
patterns as instances or consequences of quantum holism or
nonseparability. Just what holism and nonseparability are supposed to
be has not always been made clear, though, and each of these notions
has been understood in different ways. Moreover, while some have taken
holism and nonseparability to come to the same thing, others have
thought it important to distinguish the two. Any evaluation of the
significance of quantum holism and/or nonseparability must rest on a
careful analysis of these notions and their physical applications.

Intertheory Relations in Physics,0.9231646060943604,0.4893956482410431,"


Many issues in the philosophy of science concern the nature of theories
and certain relations that may obtain between them. Typically, one is
interested in the degree to which a successor to a given theory “goes
beyond” (both descriptively and explanatorily) the theory it succeeds.
Most often these issues are framed in the context of reductive
relations between theories. When does a theory \(T'\) reduce
to a theory \(T\)? How is one to understand the nature of this
reduction relation? Interestingly, there are two distinct, yet, related
ways of understanding the reductive relationship between \(T\) and
\(T'\). Thomas Nickles noted this in a paper entitled “Two
Concepts of Intertheoretic Reduction.” On the one hand, there is the
“philosopher’s” sense of reduction on which the supplanted theory is
said to reduce to the newer more encompassing theory. On the other
hand, the “physicist’s” sense of reduction puts things the other way.
The newer, typically more refined theory is said to reduce to the older
typically less encompassing theory in some sort of limit. These two
senses of reduction will be discussed in turn.

Quantum Field Theory,0.918796956539154,0.3757922351360321,"

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is the mathematical and conceptual
framework for contemporary elementary particle physics.  In a rather
informal sense QFT is the extension of quantum mechanics (QM), dealing
with particles, over to fields, i.e. systems with an infinite number
of degrees of freedom. (See the entry on
 quantum mechanics.)
In the last few years QFT has become a more widely discussed
topic in philosophy of science, with questions ranging from
methodology and semantics to ontology.  QFT taken seriously in its
metaphysical implications seems to give a picture of the world which
is at variance with central classical conceptions of particles and
fields, and even with some features of QM.

the status of QFT is among other theories of physics. Since there is a
strong emphasis on those aspects of the theory that are particularly
important for interpretive inquiries, it does not replace an
introduction to QFT as such. One main group of target readers are
philosophers who want to get a first impression of some issues that
may be of interest for their own work, another target group are
physicists who are interested in a philosophical view upon QFT.

before both eruptions take place. This idea, that simultaneous
correlated events must have prior common causes, was first made precise
by Hans Reichenbach (Reichenbach 1956). It can be used to infer the
existence of unobserved and unobservable events, and to infer causal
relations from statistical relations. Unfortunately it does not appear
to be universally valid, nor is there agreement as to the circumstances
in which it is valid.

principles versus symmetry arguments. It mentions the different

works his absorption in the political events and intellectual movements
of his time, but the questions he raises are so profound and the
strategies he uses for tackling them so richly suggestive and
provocative that educated readers of nearly every period have in some
way been influenced by him, and in practically every age there have
been philosophers who count themselves Platonists in some important
respects. He was not the first thinker or writer to whom the word
“philosopher” should be applied. But he was so
self-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived, and what its
scope and ambitions properly are, and he so transformed the
intellectual currents with which he grappled, that the subject of
philosophy, as it is often conceived—a rigorous and systematic
examination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological
issues, armed with a distinctive method—can be called his
invention. Few other authors in the history of Western philosophy approximate
him in depth and range: perhaps only Aristotle (who studied with him),

Plato's Ethics: An Overview,0.5432969331741333,0.2820010781288147,"

Like most other ancient philosophers, Plato maintains a virtue-based
eudaemonistic conception of ethics. That is to say, happiness or
well-being (eudaimonia) is the highest aim of moral thought
and conduct, and the virtues (aretê:
‘excellence’) are the requisite skills and dispositions
needed to attain it. If Plato’s conception of happiness is
elusive and his support for a morality of happiness seems somewhat
subdued, there are several reasons. First, he nowhere defines the
concept or makes it the direct target of investigation, but introduces
it in an oblique way in the pursuit of other questions. Second, the
treatment of the human good varies in the different dialogues, so that
readers find themselves confronted with the problem of what to make of
the discrepancies in different works. This touches on a fundamental
problem with Plato’s work – namely whether to follow a
‘unitarian’, ‘revisionist’, or
‘developmentalist’ approach to Plato’s writings.
Whereas unitarians regard the dialogues as pieces of one mosaic, and
take the view that Plato in essence maintains a unified doctrine from
his earliest to his latest works, revisionists maintain that
Plato’s thought underwent a fundamental transformation later in
his life, while ‘developmentalist’ hold that Plato’s
views evolved significantly throughout his career. While revisionism
has lost its impact in recent years, developmentalism has gained in
influence. Although there is no unanimity, few unitarians deny
nowadays that the character of Plato’s early, middle, and late
works differ in style, language, scope and content, as is to be
expected in a philosopher who worked for more than fifty years. Most
developmentalists, in turn, agree that it is impossible to line up
Plato’s works like pearls on a string and to reconstruct his
progress from dialogue to dialogue; for example, where the views
expressed in different dialogues seem to disagree there may be
complementation or supplementation at work, rather than divergence.
Given that Plato never speaks in his own voice, it is important to
take note of who the interlocutors are and what role is assigned to
Socrates, if he is the main speaker. Plato’s dialogues should
never be treated in isolation when it comes to the reconstruction of
his doctrine; but even the comparison and contrasting of ideas
presented in different dialogues is not a sure recipe for interpreting
this elusive thinker’s views. 

Plato’s so-called ‘Socratic’ dialogues share certain
characteristics as a group. They are short interrogations by Socrates
of the kind indicated in his explanation of his divine mission in the
Apology. They seem designed to undermine unquestioned
traditional views and values rather than to develop positive accounts,
although they sometimes contain indications that seeming dead ends are
not real dead ends. The positive accounts contained in the middle
dialogues – the so-called ‘Platonic’ dialogues
– that are grouped around the Republic – treat
happiness in different ways as a state of perfection. The exact nature
of this state is not easy to pinpoint, however, because it is based on
metaphysical presuppositions that are, at least prima facie, both hazy
and out of the realm of ordinary understanding. There is not, as there
is in Aristotle, an explicit determination of happiness as a
self-sufficient state of the active individual. Instead, at least in
some texts, Plato’s moral ideals appear both austere and
self-abnegating: The soul is to remain aloof from the pleasures of the
body in the pursuit of higher knowledge, while communal life demands
the subordination of individual wishes and aims to the common good.


The difficulties of assessing Plato’s ethical thought are
compounded by the fact that the metaphysical underpinnings seem to
have changed during his long life. In the Socratic dialogues, there
are no indications that the search for virtue and the human good goes
beyond the human realm. This changes with the middle dialogues, which
show a growing interest in an all-encompassing metaphysical grounding
of knowledge, a development that leads to the positing of the
‘Forms’ as the true nature of all things, culminating in
the Form of the Good as the transcendent principle of all goodness.
Though the theory of the Forms is not confined to human values, but
encompasses the whole of nature, Plato in the middle dialogues seems
to assume no more than an analogy between human affairs and cosmic
harmony. The late dialogues, by contrast, display a growing tendency
to assume a unity between the microcosm of human life and the
macrocosmic harmonic order of the entire universe, a tendency that is
displayed most fully in the Philebus and the
Timaeus. While these holistic tendencies appeal to the
imagination because they rely on harmonic relations expressed in
mathematical proportions, the metaphysical status of the Forms is even
harder to make out in the late dialogues than in the middle dialogues.
Though Plato’s late works do not show any willingness to lower
the standards of knowledge as such, Plato acknowledges that his design
of a rational cosmic order is based on conjecture and speculation, an
acknowledgement that finds its counterpart in his more pragmatic
treatment of ethical standards and political institutions in his
latest politcal work, the Laws. Finally, at no stage of his
philosophy does Plato go into a systematic treatment of, or and
commitment to, basic principles of ethics from which rules and norms
of human interaction can be derived and justified. Instead, Plato
largely confines himself to the depiction of the good soul and of what
is good for the soul, on the assumption that the state of the soul is
the necessary and sufficient condition for the good life and its moral
precepts. This abstemiousness explains the widely diverging
reconstructions of Plato’s ethics in the secondary literature
from antiquity to this day.

Plato on Friendship and Eros,0.5280373692512512,0.3189336061477661,"

Plato discusses love (erôs) and friendship
(philia) primarily in two dialogues, the Lysis and
the Symposium, though the Phaedrus also adds
significantly to his views. In each work, Socrates as the
quintessential philosopher is in two ways center stage, first, as a
lover of wisdom (sophia) and discussion (logos),
and, second, as himself an inverter or disturber of erotic norms.
Plato’s views on love are a meditation on Socrates and the power his
philosophical conversations have to mesmerize, obsess, and
educate.

In what follows, section 1 deals with the Lysis and
Symposium. Sections 2–4 primarily with the
Symposium alone. Section 5 deals with the Phaedrus.
Section 6 with the closing section of the Symposium and with
parts of the Ion, Protagoras, and Laws.
Sections are not self-contained, however, and are intended to be read
sequentially. Most scholars agree that the order of composition of the
“erotic” dialogues is Lysis, Symposium, Phaedrus,
though some put the Phaedrus earlier than the
Symposium.

The Laws is one of Plato’s last dialogues. In it, he sketches
the basic political structure and laws of an ideal city named Magnesia.
Despite the fact that the Laws treats a number of basic issues
in political and ethical philosophy as well as theology, it has

however, more scholarly attention has been paid to the Laws.

Plato on Rhetoric and Poetry,0.5393515825271606,0.2953491508960724,"

Plato's discussions of rhetoric and poetry are both extensive and
influential. As in so many other cases, he sets the agenda for the
subsequent tradition. And yet understanding his remarks about each of
these topics—rhetoric and poetry—presents us with
significant philosophical and interpretive challenges. Further, it is
not initially clear why he links the two topics together so closely
(he suggests that poetry is a kind of rhetoric). Plato certainly
thought that matters of the greatest importance hang in the balance,
as is clear from the famous statement that “there is an old
quarrel between philosophy and poetry” (Republic,
607b5–6). In his dialogues, both this quarrel and the related
quarrel between philosophy and rhetoric amount to clashes between
comprehensive world-views—those of philosophy on the one hand,
and of poetry or rhetoric on the other. What are these quarrels about?
What does Plato mean by “poetry” and
“rhetoric”? The purpose of this article is to analyze his
discussions of rhetoric and poetry as they are presented in four
dialogues: the Ion, the Republic, the
Gorgias, and the Phaedrus. Plato is (perhaps
paradoxically) known for the poetic and rhetoric qualities of his own
writings, a fact which will also be discussed in what follows.

Plato's Shorter Ethical Works,0.5306966304779053,0.2804393470287323,"


Plato's shorter ethical works show Socrates at work on topics related
to virtue, which he believes we should seek for the sake of the soul as we should
seek health for the body. Works in this group shows stylistic as well
as philosophic affinities and are generally considered to have been
written early in Plato's career. The dialogues in this group are our
main source for the philosophical style and teaching of the Platonic
Socrates, who is thought by some scholars to be to a reasonable
approximation of the historical figure. In this article,
“Socrates” always refers to the Platonic figure in the
works under discussion here.


Sections 2 through 9 concern philosophical themes that are common to
the works under discussion.  Section 10 deals with the intellectual
world that Plato uses as a backdrop for these dialogues.  Sections 11

Platonism in Metaphysics,0.7854967713356018,0.56882244348526,"

Platonism is the view that there exist such things as abstract objects
— where an abstract object is an object that does not exist in
space or time and which is therefore entirely non-physical and
non-mental. Platonism in this sense is a contemporary view.
It is obviously related to the views of Plato in important ways, but
it is not entirely clear that Plato endorsed this view, as it is
defined here. In order to remain neutral on this question, the term
‘platonism’ is spelled with a lower-case ‘p’.
(See entry on
 Plato.)
 The most important figure in the development of modern platonism is
Gottlob Frege (1884, 1892, 1893–1903, 1919). The view has also
been endorsed by many others, including Kurt Gödel (1964),
Bertrand Russell (1912), and W.V.O. Quine (1948, 1951).

Section 1 will describe the contemporary platonist view in detail.
Section 2 will describe the alternatives to platonism — namely,
conceptualism, nominalism, immanent realism, and Meinongianism.
Section 3 will develop and assess the first important argument in
favor of platonism, namely, the One Over Many argument. Section 4 will
develop and assess a second argument for platonism, namely, the
Singular Term argument. This argument emerged much later than the One
Over Many argument, but as we will see, it is widely thought to be
more powerful. Finally, section 5 will develop and assess the most
important argument against platonism, namely, the
epistemological argument.

Pleasure,0.5291884541511536,0.5507611036300659,"

Pleasure, in the inclusive usages important in thought about
well-being, experience, and mind, includes the affective positivity of
all joy, gladness, liking, and enjoyment – all our feeling
good or happy. It is often contrasted with the similarly inclusive
pain, or suffering, of all our feeling
 bad.[1]
 Nowadays
 “happiness”
 is often used similarly, which leads to confusion with older uses
signifying overall good fortune or success in life that figure in
self-reports of happiness and in ‘happiness studies’ of
the diverse sources of these.

Pleasure presents as good and attractive – itself, when it
comes to our notice, and all else that appears aglow in its light.
This suggests simple explanations both of why people pursue pleasure
and why there are reasons to do so. That we may prefer and choose
something for its pleasure suggests that there are facts about
pleasure that make some such choices better than others. Philosophers,
taking this suggestion further, have sometimes taken pleasure to be a
single simple (feature of) experience that makes
experiences good and attractive to the extent it is present.
This simple picture has often been associated with more
sweeping normative and psychological claims, all ambiguously called
 “hedonism”.
 These take pleasure’s goodness and attractiveness (and
pain’s badness and aversiveness) to (between them) explain
all of human value, normative practical reasons, and
motivation. Pleasure and pain would, if views of all three
kinds were true, be the only ultimately good- and bad-making
features of human (and relevantly similar animal) life and also
both the only actual ultimate ends and the only justified
ultimate ends of all our voluntary pursuit and avoidance. The
simple picture and related hedonistic claims and explanations were
especially prominent in the psychology, economics, and philosophy of
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries but were widely rejected in
the twentieth.

Contemporary science partly restores pleasure’s importance but
also suggests that pleasure’s relations to awareness and
motivational attraction are more variable than many hedonists and much
ordinary thinking supposed. Contemporary philosophers continue to
debate what pleasure is but are only beginning to address scientific
advances that are slowly filling out what age-old use of psychoactive
substances to enhance mood and newer drug therapies for depression
already presupposed – pleasure is a biological
phenomenon.

Plural Quantification,0.8620126843452454,0.7839233279228209,"

Ordinary English contains different forms of quantification over
objects. In addition to the usual singular quantification, as
in

(1) There is
an apple on the table


there is plural quantification, as in 

(2) There are
some apples on the table.


Ever since Frege, formal logic has favored the two singular
quantifiers \(\forall{x}\) and \(\exists{x}\) over their plural
counterparts \(\forall{xx}\) and \(\exists{xx}\) (to be read as
for any things \(xx\) and there are some things
\(xx)\). But in recent decades it has been argued that we have good
reason to admit among our primitive logical notions also the plural
quantifiers \(\forall{xx}\) and \(\exists{xx}\) (Boolos 1984 and
1985a). 

More controversially, it has been argued that the resulting formal
system with plural as well as singular quantification qualifies as
“pure logic”; in particular, that it is universally
applicable, ontologically innocent, and perfectly well understood. In
addition to being interesting in its own right, this thesis will, if
correct, make plural quantification available as an innocent but
extremely powerful tool in metaphysics, philosophy of mathematics, and
philosophical logic. For instance, George Boolos has used plural
quantification to interpret monadic second-order
 logic[1]
 and has argued on this basis that monadic second-order logic
qualifies as “pure logic”. Plural quantification has also
been used in attempts to defend logicist ideas, to account for set
theory, and to eliminate ontological commitments to mathematical
objects and complex objects.

Plutarch,0.6105791330337524,0.2042468339204788,"


Plutarch of Chaeronea in Boeotia (ca. 45–120 CE) was a
Platonist philosopher, best known to the general public as author of
his “Parallel Lives” of paired Greek and Roman statesmen
and military leaders. He was a voluminous writer, author also of a
collection of “Moralia” or “Ethical Essays,”
mostly in dialogue format, many of them devoted to philosophical
topics, not at all limited to ethics.


Plutarch's significance as a philosopher, on which this article
concentrates, lies in his attempt to do justice to Plato's work as a
whole, and to create a coherent and credible philosophical system out
of it, as Plotinus will also do later (204–270 CE). Two moves
are crucial in this regard. First, Plutarch respects both the
skeptical/aporetic element in Plato (as marked by the tentativeness
with which Socrates and the other main speakers in his dialogues
regularly advance their views) and the views apparently endorsed by
the main speakers of the dialogues, which were widely regarded as
Plato's own doctrines (e.g. Diogenes Laertius 3.51–2). Second,
Plutarch focuses primarily and quite strongly on the Timaeus
for his understanding of Plato's “doctrines,” and his
interpretation of this dialogue shapes his understanding of the entire
Plato. Plutarch maintains a literal interpretation of the
Timaeus, according to which the world has come about in time
from two principles, the creator god and the “Indefinite
Dyad”. While the Dyad accounts for disorder and multiplicity,
such as that of disordered matter before the creation of the ordered
physical world, of which pre-cosmic stage Timaeus appears to speak in
the Timaeus, god accounts for order and the nature and
identity of objects and properties in the world.
This metaphysical dualism is further strengthened by the assumption
of two mediating entities through which the two principles operate;
the Indefinite Dyad operates through a non-rational cosmic soul, while
god through a rational one. This is the same soul, which becomes
rational when god imparts reason from himself to it. As a result of
god's imparting reason to the world soul, matter ceases to move in a
disorderly manner, being brought into order through the imposition of
Forms on it. The postulation of a non-rational pre-cosmic world soul,
inspired mainly by Laws X (but absent from the
Timaeus), allows Plutarch to dissolve the apparent
contradiction in different works of Plato that the soul is said to be
both uncreated (eternal) and created. For in his view the first soul
of the sensible world, the world soul, is created only in the sense
that god, the demiurge of the Timaeus, makes it rational. The
postulation of a non-rational pre-cosmic soul also allows Plutarch to
account for the existence of badness in the world, because in his view
residual irrationality abides in the world soul even when it becomes
rational, which is accounted for by the fact that the world soul is
originally non-rational in the sense that its movement is such,
i.e. disorderly, and reason is an element external to it.
 This dualism (non-rational-disorderly-bad
vs. rational-orderly-good) pervades also the sensible or physical
world, since the human soul, being derivative from the world soul, has
a rational and a non-rational aspect too, as the Republic
proposes. In this spirit Plutarch distinguishes both in the world and
in human beings three aspects, body, soul, and intellect. The soul's
concern with the body gives rise to the non-rational aspect, which
amounts to disorder, vice, or badness, while the co-operation between
soul and intellect promotes rationality, that is, order, virtue,
benevolence. In an attempt to accommodate the diverse strands of
ethical thought in Plato (e.g. in the Gorgias,
Protagoras, Republic, Phaedo,
Theaetetus, Timaeus), Plutarch is the first
Platonist to distinguish different levels of ethical life, which we
could term political and theoretical respectively, depending on
whether virtue pertains to the soul as organizing principle for one's
daily life, or to the intellect as one's guide to knowledge of the
Forms (which include virtues) and of the intelligible realm more
generally.

Henri Poincaré,0.8901603817939758,0.4595884680747986,"

Henri Poincaré was a mathematician, theoretical physicist and a
philosopher of science famous for discoveries in several fields and
referred to as the last polymath, one who could make significant
contributions in multiple areas of mathematics and the physical
sciences. This survey will focus on Poincaré’s
philosophy. Concerning Poincaré’s scientific legacy, see
Browder (1983) and Charpentier, Ghys, Lesne (2010).

Poincaré’s philosophy is primarily that of a scientist
originating in his own daily practice of science and in the scientific
debates of his time. As such, it is strongly influenced by the
reflections of Ernst Mach, James Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz.
However, his thinking is also strongly influenced by the philosophical
doctrines of his time (those of Emile Boutroux, who was his
brother-in-law, but also of Jules Lachelier, William James, etc.), and
is imbued with the neokantism that was very much in vogue.
Nevertheless, one must not assume that Poincaré’s
“Kantian” vocabulary is exactly that of the German
philosopher, given that Poincaré often radically changes the
meaning of Kant’s terms.

In 1880, he collaborated with Émile Boutroux on the edition of
Leibniz’ Monadology, providing an article comparing the
physics of Descartes and Leibniz. It was not until the 1890s, however,
that he became a central actor in the French philosophical scene,
notably through his continuous involvement in the Revue de
métaphysique et de morale (in which he published some
twenty articles) and his participation in the organization of a large
number of events: the celebration of the centenary of the birth of
Descartes, the International Congress of Philosophy of 1900, and the
international edition of the works of Leibniz.

Poincaré is best known for his critique of logicism and for his
geometric conventionalism. The two traditions interpreting
Poincaré’s work thus reflect, on the one hand, a
philosophy of mathematics that endorses his intuitionist tendency and
his polemics against logicism or formalism, and, on the other hand,
his conventionalism both in the philosophy of science and in a broad
linguistic sense. In reality, these intuitionistic and formal aspects
are two sides of the same coin, given that Poincaré always
supports a single position aimed at a reconstruction of the process of
understanding scientific theories (see Heinzmann 2010). Neither
formalistic nor intuitionist nor empiricist, Poincare opens a path
lying between a realist and an anti-realist theory of mathematical
knowledge.

After providing a short biographical sketch, we will present
Poincaré’s views organized as follows:

adopted the philosophy of Ibn Rushd (Averroes), whom they considered
the best interpreter of Aristotle. Secondly, they interpreted Judaism
in light of Averroes’ Aristotelianism on the assumption that
Judaism and true philosophy must always coincide. In addition to his
initial goal of giving the principles of Judaism a radically
naturalistic Averroistic interpretation, Polqar, in a more apologetic
vein, sought to defend that interpretation from criticisms leveled
against it by Christians and converts, as well as by members of his
own Jewish community who held more traditional views. Polqar is best
known as the main interlocutor of his former teacher,
 Abner of Burgos

Ancient political philosophy is understood here to mean ancient
Greek and Roman thought from the classical period of Greek thought in

the fifth century CE, excluding the rise of Christian ideas about
politics during that period. Political philosophy as a genre was
invented in this period by Plato and reinvented by Aristotle: it
encompasses reflections on the origin of political institutions, the
concepts used to interpret and organize political life such as justice
and equality, the relation between the aims of ethics and the nature of
politics, and the relative merits of different constitutional
arrangements or regimes. Platonic models remained especially important
for later authors throughout this period, even as the development of
later “Hellenistic” schools of Greek philosophy, and
distinctively Roman forms of philosophical adaptation, offered new
frameworks for construing politics from a philosophical point of view.

Medieval Political Philosophy,0.6945419311523438,0.1818083077669144,"

Medieval philosophy is the philosophy produced in Western Europe
during the middle ages. There is no consensus, even among
medievalists, as to when this period begins or
 ends;[1]
 however, it is conventional—and probably neither fully correct
nor incorrect—to begin with
 Augustine
 (354–430), and note that the influence of medieval philosophy
continued past even the birth of
 Descartes
 (1596–1650). Medieval political philosophy is the part
of medieval philosophy that is concerned with political matters.
Philosophical writing about politics during the middle ages (as during
the early modern period) was often an attempt to influence public
events, and the history of the subject therefore involves reference to
those events. It also involves reference to developments in medieval
culture, e.g., the renaissances of the ninth and twelfth centuries,
and to the development of institutions such as the legal system and
the universities. The strong relationship during this period between
philosophy and religion also complicates the story. These
“extra-philosophical” connections are among the reasons
why political philosophy underwent considerable development in the
course of the middle ages, as religious and political thinking was
modified by cultural developments and the stress of events. The focus
is on the theologians and philosophers of the Latin Middle Ages, and
the general arrangement of this article is
 chronological.[2]

Political Realism in International Relations,0.42280352115631104,0.6713504791259766,"


In the discipline of international relations there are contending
general theories or theoretical perspectives. Realism, also known as
political realism, is a view of international politics that stresses
its competitive and conflictual side. It is usually contrasted with
idealism or liberalism, which tends to emphasize cooperation. Realists
consider the principal actors in the international arena to be states,
which are concerned with their own security, act in pursuit of their
own national interests, and struggle for power. The negative side of
the realists’ emphasis on power and self-interest is often their
skepticism regarding the relevance of ethical norms to relations among
states. National politics is the realm of authority and law, whereas
international politics, they sometimes claim, is a sphere without
justice, characterized by active or potential conflict among
states.


Not all realists, however, deny the presence of ethics in
international relations. The distinction should be drawn between
classical realism—represented by such twentieth-century theorists
as Reinhold Niebuhr and Hans Morgenthau—and radical or extreme
realism. While classical realism emphasizes the concept of national
interest, it is not the Machiavellian doctrine “that anything is
justified by reason of state” (Bull 1995, 189). Nor does it
involve the glorification of war or conflict. The classical realists do
not reject the possibility of moral judgment in international politics.
Rather, they are critical of moralism—abstract moral discourse
that does not take into account political realities. They assign
supreme value to successful political action based on prudence: the
ability to judge the rightness of a given action from among possible
alternatives on the basis of its likely political consequences.


Realism encompasses a variety of approaches and claims a long
theoretical tradition. Among its founding fathers, Thucydides,
Machiavelli and Hobbes are the names most usually mentioned.
Twentieth-century classical realism has today been largely replaced by
neorealism, which is an attempt to construct a more scientific approach
to the study of international relations. Both classical realism and
neorealism have been subjected to criticism from IR theorists
representing liberal, critical, and post-modern perspectives.

Religion and Political Theory,0.4574078619480133,0.6673129796981812,"


When the well-known political theorist Leo Strauss introduced the
topic of politics and religion in his reflections, he presented it as a
problem—the “theologico-political problem” he called
it (Strauss
 1997).[1]
The problem, says Strauss, is primarily
one about authority: Is political authority to be grounded in the
claims of revelation or reason, Jerusalem or Athens? In so
characterizing the problem, Strauss was tapping into currents of
thought deep in the history of political reflection in the west, ones
about the nature, extent, and justification of political
authority. Do monarchies owe their authority to divine
right? Has God delegated to secular rulers such as kings and
emperors the authority to wage war in order to achieve religious
aims: the conversion of the infidel or the repulsion of unjust attacks
on the true faith? Do secular rulers have the authority to suppress
heretics? What authority does the state retain when its principles
conflict with God's? Is the authority of the natural law ultimately
grounded in divine law? These and other questions animated much of the
discussion among medieval and modern philosophers alike.


With the emergence of liberal democracy in the modern west, however,
the types of questions that philosophers asked about the interrelation
between religion and political authority began to shift, in large
measure because the following three-fold dynamic was at work. In the
first place, divine-authorization accounts of political authority had
lost the day to consent-based approaches. Political authority in a
liberal democracy, most prominent defenders of liberal democracy
claimed, is grounded in the consent of the people to be ruled rather
than in God's act of authorization. Second, the effects of the
Protestant Reformation had made themselves felt acutely, as the
broadly homogeneous religious character of Western Europe
disintegrated into competing religious communities. The population of
Western Europe and the United States were now not only considerably
more religiously diverse, but also deeply wary of the sort of
bloodshed occasioned by the so-called religious wars. And, finally,
secularization had begun to take hold. Both the effects of religious
diversity and prominent attacks on the legitimacy of religious belief
ensured that one could no longer assume in political discussion that
one's fellow citizens were religious, let alone members of one's own
religious tradition.


 For citizens of contemporary liberal
democracies, this three-fold dynamic has yielded a curious
situation. On the one hand, most take it for granted that the
authority of the state is located in the people, that the people are
religiously diverse, and that important segments of people doubt the
rationality of religious belief and practice of any sort. On the
other hand, contrary to the predictions of many advocates of
secularization theory, such as Karl Marx, Max Weber, and (at one time)
Peter Berger, this mix of democracy, religious diversity, and religious
criticism has not resulted in the disappearance or privatization of
religion. Religion, especially in liberal democracies such as the
United States, is alive and well, shaping political culture in numerous
ways. Consequently, there very much remains a
theologico-political problem. The problem, moreover, still
concerns political authority, though now reframed by the transition to
liberal democracy. If recent reflection on the issue is any
guide, the most pressing problem to address is this: Given that
state-authorized coercion needs to be justified, and that the
justification of state coercion requires the consent of the people,
what role may religious reasons play in justifying state
coercion? More specifically, in a religiously pluralistic context
such as one finds in contemporary liberal democracies, are religious
reasons sufficient to justify a coercive law for which reasonable
agents cannot find an adequate secular rationale?


 This article considers the most important
answers to these questions offered by recent philosophers, political
theorists, and theologians. We present these answers as part of a
lively three-way discussion between advocates of what we call the
standard view, their liberal critics, and proponents of the so-called
New Traditionalism. Briefly stated, advocates of the standard
view argue that in contemporary liberal democracies, significant
restraints must be put on the political role of religious
reasons. Their liberal critics deny this, or at least deny that
good reasons have been given to believe this. New
Traditionalists, by contrast, turn their back on both the standard view
and its liberal critics, arguing that religious orthodoxy and liberal
democracy are fundamentally incompatible. To have a grip on this
three-way debate, we suggest, is to understand that dimension of the
theologico-political problem that most animates philosophical
reflection in liberal democracies on the relation between religion and
politics.

Pietro Pomponazzi,0.5807220935821533,0.2332256287336349,"

Pietro Pomponazzi (1462–1525) was a leading philosopher of
Renaissance Italy. Teaching primarily at the universities at Padua and
Bologna, he developed innovative approaches to Aristotelian natural
philosophy and psychology. He gained particular fame, and notoriety,
for his philosophical investigations into the mortality of the soul
and for his naturalistic explanations of seemingly miraculous
phenomena and of the development of religions. Pomponazzi was notable
for his philosophical challenges to religious doctrine as well as for
his use of Alexander of Aphrodisias’s writings and Stoic ideas
to forge what he considered to be a purer or more accurate
interpretation of Aristotle’s natural philosophy and
psychology.

Karl Popper is generally regarded as one of the greatest philosophers
of science of the 20th century. He was also a social and political
philosopher of considerable stature, a self-professed
critical-rationalist, a dedicated opponent of all forms of scepticism,
conventionalism, and relativism in science and in human affairs
generally and a committed advocate and staunch defender of the
‘Open Society’. One of the many remarkable features of
Popper’s thought is the scope of his intellectual influence: he
was lauded by Bertrand Russell, taught Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend
and the future billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros at
the London School of Economics, numbered David Miller, Joseph Agassi,
Alan Musgrave and Jeremy Shearmur amongst his research assistants
there and had reciprocally beneficial friendships with the economist
Friedrich Hayek and the art historian Ernst Gombrich. Additionally,
Peter Medawar, John Eccles and Hermann Bondi are amongst the
distinguished scientists who have acknowledged their intellectual
indebtedness to his work, the latter declaring that “There is no
more to science than its method, and there is no more to its method
than Popper has said.”

Porphyry (234?–305? C.E.) was a Neoplatonist philosopher born in
Tyre in Phoenicia. He studied with Longinus in Athens and then with
Plotinus in Rome from 263–269 C.E. and became a follower of the
latter's version of Platonism. Porphyry wrote in just about every
branch of learning practiced at the time but only a portion of his
large output is extant. Porphyry was an influential thinker. He
applied Neoplatonism to pagan religion and other spheres and is, as
such, a key figure in the promulgation of Neoplatonic thought. His
writings on Aristotle's logical works, preserved in part and
influential in the Latin West through Boethius' translations, contain
attempts to harmonize Aristotle's logical writings with Platonism.

Giambattista della Porta,0.5773702263832092,0.2492976486682892,"
To most modern readers, it would stretch definitions to include
someone like Giovan Battista Della Porta (1535–1615) in an
encyclopedia of philosophy. In a typical assessment of
Porta’s Magia Naturalis, Wayne Shumaker writes:
 Occasionally [Porta] shows that he has actually
experimented, as in writing about the lodestone or burning-glasses. On
the whole, however, the treatise is backward-looking.  (1972: 120)


Yet philosophy in Porta’s time encompassed a far wider range of
topics than it does today, including cosmology, meteorology, and
physics; biology and human psychology; and moral philosophy and
politics. As a prolific writer on topics then associated with more or
less alternative currents to Aristotelian natural philosophy (Henry
2008), Porta became one of the most famous and popular figures in the
intellectual life of the second half of the sixteenth century and
beyond.[1] Porta
thus ranks amongst the many rather unorthodox praeternatural
philosophers in the traditional categories of the peripatetic
curriculum. In the rich intellectual ferment that eventually generated
the scientific revolution of the following century, Porta constitutes
a highly interesting transitional figure because he engaged with the
world of objects, craft and chemical substances. From this
“scientific underworld” occupied by the “professors
of secrets” emerged a naturalized concept of human beings and
innovative ideas about science (Smith 2009), which Porta amply (and
critically) reflects. His impressive number of texts are written in
very different literary genres, ranging from learned Latin treatises
to stage plays—mannerist comedies written in Italian, some of
which resonated widely and seem to have influenced Shakespeare (Clubb
1964, 2008). The wonders Porta produced onstage and in his laboratory
had a decidedly histrionic character, and perhaps this alignment of
theatre and nascent science provides one of the more coherent
perspectives on Porta’s many different intellectual endeavours
(Kodera 2012).

Port Royal Logic,0.7664920687675476,0.639980673789978,"

La Logique ou l'art de penser, better known as
the Port-Royal Logic (hereinafter Logic), was the
most influential logic text from Aristotle to the end of the
nineteenth century. The authors were Antoine Arnauld and Pierre
Nicole, philosophers and theologians associated with the Port-Royal
Abbey, a center of the heretical Catholic Jansenist movement in
seventeenth-century France. The first edition appeared in 1662; during
the authors' lifetimes four major revisions were published, the last
and most important in 1683. The 1981 critical edition by Pierre Clair
and François Girbal lists 63 French editions and 10 English editions
(the 1818 English edition served as a text at the Universities of
Cambridge and Oxford).  The work treats topics in logic, grammar,
philosophy of language, theory of knowledge, and
metaphysics. The Logic is a companion to General and
Rational Grammar: The Port-Royal Grammar, written primarily by
Arnauld and “edited” by Claude Lancelot, which appeared in
1660. In general the semantics of the Logic are situated in
the context of the Cartesian theory of ideas. Its value to us today
resides in its combination of deep insights and confusions. 


This entry will briefly discuss Arnauld's connection to the Port-Royal
Abbey and the Jansenist movement. Then follows an overview of the
work, including a discussion of the Cartesian background and a summary
of the main topics treated. The remainder of the discussion will focus
on some aspects of the theory of most interest to current logicians
and philosophers of language, in particular, the theory of judgment,
the semantics of general terms, and the theory of distribution and
truth conditions of propositions.

Postmodernism,0.5063104033470154,0.479568749666214,"


That postmodernism is indefinable is a truism. However, it can be
described as a set of critical, strategic and rhetorical practices
employing concepts such as difference, repetition, the trace, the
simulacrum, and hyperreality to destabilize other concepts such as
presence, identity, historical progress, epistemic certainty, and the
univocity of meaning.  

The term “postmodernism” first entered the philosophical
lexicon in 1979, with the publication of The Postmodern
Condition by Jean-François Lyotard. I therefore give
Lyotard pride of place in the sections that follow. An economy of
selection dictated the choice of other figures for this entry. I have
selected only those most commonly cited in discussions of
philosophical postmodernism, five French and two Italian, although
individually they may resist common affiliation. Ordering them by
nationality might duplicate a modernist schema they would question,
but there are strong differences among them, and these tend to divide
along linguistic and cultural lines. The French, for example, work
with concepts developed during the structuralist revolution in Paris
in the 1950s and early 1960s, including structuralist readings of Marx
and Freud. For this reason they are often called
“poststructuralists.” They also cite the events of May
1968 as a watershed moment for modern thought and its institutions,
especially the universities. The Italians, by contrast, draw upon a
tradition of aesthetics and rhetoric including figures such as
Giambattista Vico and Benedetto Croce. Their emphasis is strongly
historical, and they exhibit no fascination with a revolutionary
moment. Instead, they emphasize continuity, narrative, and difference
within continuity, rather than counter-strategies and discursive
gaps. Neither side, however, suggests that postmodernism is an attack
upon modernity or a complete departure from it. Rather, its
differences lie within modernity itself, and postmodernism is a
continuation of modern thinking in another mode.

Finally, I have included a summary of Habermas's critique of
postmodernism, representing the main lines of discussion on both sides
of the Atlantic. Habermas argues that postmodernism contradicts itself
through self-reference, and notes that postmodernists presuppose
concepts they otherwise seek to undermine, e.g., freedom,
subjectivity, or creativity. He sees in this a rhetorical application
of strategies employed by the artistic avant-garde of the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries, an avant-garde that is possible only because
modernity separates artistic values from science and politics in the
first place.  On his view, postmodernism is an illicit
aestheticization of knowledge and public discourse.  Against this,
Habermas seeks to rehabilitate modern reason as a system of procedural
rules for achieving consensus and agreement among communicating
subjects. Insofar as postmodernism introduces aesthetic playfulness
and subversion into science and politics, he resists it in the name of
a modernity moving toward completion rather than
self-transformation.

Practical Reason,0.5575990080833435,0.7841397523880005,"


Practical reason is the general human capacity for resolving, through
reflection, the question of what one is to do. Deliberation of this
kind is practical in at least two senses. First, it is practical in
its subject matter, insofar as it is concerned with action. But it is
also practical in its consequences or its issue, insofar as reflection
about action itself directly moves people to act.  Our capacity for
deliberative self-determination raises two sets of philosophical
problems.  First, there are questions about how deliberation can
succeed in being practical in its issue. What do we need to
assume—both about agents and about the processes of reasoning
they engage in—to make sense of the fact that deliberative
reflection can directly give rise to action? Can we do justice to this
dimension of practical reason while preserving the idea that practical
deliberation is genuinely a form of reasoning? Second, there are large
issues concerning the content of the standards that are brought to
bear in practical reasoning.  Which norms for the assessment of action
are binding on us as agents? Do these norms provide resources for
critical reflection about our ends, or are they exclusively
instrumental? Under what conditions do moral norms yield valid
standards for reasoning about action? The first set of issues is
addressed in sections 1–3 of the present article, while sections 4–5
cover the second set of issues.

Practical Reason and the Structure of Actions,0.5584268569946289,0.7832832336425781,"

A wave of recent philosophical work on practical rationality is
organized by the following implicit argument: Practical reasoning is
figuring out what to do; to do is to act; so the forms of practical
inference can be derived from the structure or features of action. Now
it is not as though earlier work in analytic philosophy had failed to
register the connection between action and practical rationality; in
fact, practical reasoning was usually picked out as, roughly,
reasoning directed toward action. But for much of the twentieth
century, attention moved quickly away from this initial delineation of
the subject area, to the interplay of beliefs and desires within the
mind (instrumentalist theories, including their Davidsonian and
Williamsian variants), or to procedures for checking that a plan of
action was supported by sufficient yet consistent reasons (Kantian
theories), or to the ultra-refined sensibilities of the practically
intelligent reasoner (Aristotelian theories). The hallmark of the
emerging family of treatments to be surveyed here is, first, the
sustained attention paid to answering the question, “What does
it take to be an action (at all)?”, and second, the use made of
a distinction between full-fledged action and its lesser relatives;
characterizations and terminology vary, but often the less robust
alternative is called “mere activity” or “mere
behavior”. Very schematically, these arguments for a theory of
practical reasoning try to show that reasons brought to bear on choice
must have some particular logical form, if action is not to lapse into
something less than that.

The current state of the dialectic is evidently transitional, because
work of this sort for the most part does not yet speak to other work
of the same kind. (Recent exceptions are marked below, and it does
speak to earlier but differently focused work in the field.) Despite
their shared agreement that practical reasoning is where the action
is, and the consequent willingness to accord explanatory priority to
action theory in developing theories of practical rationality, these
theorists differ among themselves as to what the most central features
of actions are, and accordingly they disagree about what the
legitimate patterns of practical inference turn out to be. They also
differ in their underlying philosophical motivations, as well as in
what they take to be the upshots of their views for substantive moral
theory. For that reason, the considerations in play do not have the
sort of mutual coherence and organization characteristic of the
discussion of some of the more settled philosophical problem
spaces.

The purpose of this overview is to provide a map of this territory,
and because interchanges between the theorists in it are infrequent,
this is primarily going to mean describing the disparate research
programs that have adopted its framing argument. Because the priority
is to highlight both their common ground, and the ways in which these
programs nonetheless talk past one another, this article will not
press a number of problems internal to the several research programs.
If you notice some obvious but unaddressed objection to some line of
inquiry, don't assume you're making a mistake, but don't let it
sidetrack you.

The features of action that have come in for the most attention are,
first, its calculative structure, second, its attributability, third,
its aspiration to be challenging and ambitious, fourth its role in
social practice, and fifth, its evaluative features, and they will be
discussed in that order. That will permit us to conclude with remarks
about the prospects and agenda of this approach to practical
deliberation.

Pragmatics,0.7637372612953186,0.7325025796890259,"

When a diplomat says yes, he means ‘perhaps’;
When he says perhaps, he means ‘no’;
When he says no, he is not a diplomat.
—Voltaire (Quoted, in Spanish, in Escandell 1993.)



These lines — also attributed to H. L. Mencken and Carl Jung
— may or may not be fair to diplomats, but are surely correct in
reminding us that more is involved in what one communicates than what
one literally says; more is involved in what one means than the
standard, conventional meaning of the words one uses. The words
‘yes,’ ‘perhaps,’ and ‘no’ each
has a perfectly identifiable meaning, known by every speaker of
English (including not very competent ones). However, as those lines
illustrate, it is possible for different speakers in different
circumstances to mean different things using those words. How is this
possible? What's the relationship among the meaning of words, what
speakers mean when uttering those words, the particular circumstances
of their utterance, their intentions, their actions, and what they
manage to communicate? These are some of the questions that pragmatics
tries to answer; the sort of questions that, roughly speaking, serve
to characterize the field of pragmatics.

Pragmatism,0.6973975300788879,0.6493433713912964,"


Pragmatism was a philosophical tradition that originated in the United
States around 1870. The most important of the ‘classical
pragmatists’ were Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914),
William James (1842–1910) and John Dewey (1859–1952). The
influence of pragmatism declined during the first two thirds of the
twentieth century, but it has undergone a revival since the 1970s with
philosophers being increasingly willing to use the writings and ideas
of the classical pragmatists, and also a number of thinkers, such as
Richard Rorty, Hilary Putnam and Robert Brandom developing
philosophical views that represent later stages of the pragmatist
tradition. The core of pragmatism was the pragmatist maxim, a rule for
clarifying the contents of hypotheses by tracing their
‘practical consequences’. In the work of Peirce and James,
the most influential application of the pragmatist maxim was to the
concept of truth. But the pragmatists have also tended to share a
distinctive epistemological outlook, a fallibilist anti-Cartesian
approach to the norms that govern inquiry.
For much of the twentieth century, pragmatism was largely in
eclipse. Few philosophers were familiar with the works of classical
pragmatists such as Charles Sanders Pierce and William James, and
pragmatist ideas were not at the centre of debate. John Dewey, who had
been a dominant philosophical figure in the 1920s, was no longer a
central figure. Analytical philosophers and their students had a
central role in philosophy. It was not until the 1970s that interest
in the writings of the Pragmatists became widespread and pragmatist
ideas were recognized as able to make a major contribution to
philosophy.
Most of this entry is devoted to the ideas of the classical
pragmatists, Peirce, James, and Dewey. But towards the end of the
entry we shall explore what are sometimes called ‘the new
pragmatists’. These are philosophers who revitalized pragmatism,
developing ideas that evidently belonged to the pragmatist
tradition. As well as the figures mentioned above, these include
Philip Kitcher, Huw Price, and others (Misak 2007, Malachowski
2013). There has also been a growing interest in the connections
between pragmatism and idealism: (Margolis 2010, Stern 2009,
chapters 7–10).

Petitionary Prayer,0.7100545763969421,0.6082126498222351,"

Prayer seems to be a prominent feature of every religion. When people
pray, they attempt to communicate with special persons or entities,
such as a God or gods, or dead relatives, or exemplary human beings
who are believed to occupy some special status.

People pray for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes people pray in order
to give thanks, sometimes to offer praise and adoration, sometimes to
apologize and seek forgiveness, and sometimes to ask for things. The
focus of this article is petitionary prayer, in which a petitioner
requests something. Historically, the most interesting philosophical
puzzles concerning petitionary prayer have arisen in connection with
the traditional monotheism shared by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
According to traditional monotheism, God is omniscient (knows
everything that can be known), omnibenevolent (perfectly good),
omnipotent (can do everything that is compatible with the other
attributes mentioned above), impassible (unable to be affected by an
outside source), immutable (unchanging), and free. In this article, we
will explore the most prominent philosophical puzzles that arise in
connection with the idea of offering petitionary prayers to God, as
understood along the lines just described, along with the most
influential attempts to solve them. (For a more complete inventory of
these puzzles and attempts to resolve them, see Davison 2017.)

In early philosophical literature, a ‘prediction’ was
considered to be an empirical consequence of a theory that had not yet
been verified at the time the theory was constructed—an
‘accommodation’ was one that had.  The view that
predictions are superior to accommodations in the assessment of
scientific theories is known as ‘predictivism’. Commonly,
however, predictivism is understood more precisely as entailing that
evidence confirms theory more strongly when predicted than when
accommodated.  Much ink has been spilled modifying the concept of
‘prediction’ and explaining why predictivism is or is not
true, and whether the history of science reveals that scientists are
predictivist in their assessment of theories. The debate over
predictivism also figures importantly in the debate about scientific
realism.

Presentism is the view that only present things exist (Hinchliff 1996:
123; Crisp 2004: 15; Markosian 2004: 47–48).
So understood, presentism is an ontological doctrine; it’s a
view about what exists (what there is), absolutely and unrestrictedly.
The view is the subject of extensive discussion in the literature,
with much of it focused on the problems that presentism allegedly
faces. Thus, much of the literature that frames the development of
presentism has grown up either in formulating objections to the view
(e.g., Sider 2001: 11–52), or in response to such objections
(e.g., Bigelow 1996; Markosian 2004), with exceptions to this largely
coming via the ways in which presentism is motivated. This entry
mirrors the structure of that literature, for the most part.
Here’s the plan for what follows. We begin with a more detailed
sketch of presentism, its commitments and motivations. Then we move to
consider several concerns that have been raised for presentists. We
use these to illustrate both the breadth and severity of the
challenges that presentism faces, as well as the range of different

Anaxagoras 59); then the reports from ancient authors about that
thinker's life and thought are collected in a section of
“testimonies” (A) and numbered in order, while the
passages the editors take to be direct quotations are collected and
numbered in a section of “fragments” (B). Alleged
imitations in later authors are sometimes added in a section labeled
C. Thus, each piece of text can be uniquely identified: DK 59B12.3

We discuss presupposition, the phenomenon whereby speakers mark 
linguistically the information that is presupposed or taken for

diagnostic tests used to identify them. The reader is then introduced
to major models of presupposition from the last 50 years, separated 
into three classes: Frege-Strawson derived semantic models, pragmatic
models such as that offered by Stalnaker, and dynamic models. Finally
we discuss some of the main current issues in presupposition theory. 
These involve accommodation, which occurs when a hearer's knowledge 
state is adjusted to meet the speaker's presuppositions; 
presupposition failure, which occurs when a presupposition is (known 
to be) false; the interaction between presuppositions and attitudes; 
and the triggering problem, i.e., the problem of explaining why 
presuppositions occur in the first place.

The Principle of Sufficient Reason is a powerful and controversial
philosophical principle stipulating that everything must have a
reason, cause, or ground. This simple demand for thoroughgoing
intelligibility yields some of the boldest and most challenging theses
in the history of philosophy. In this entry we begin by explaining
the Principle and then turn to the history of the debates around it.
We conclude with an examination of the emerging contemporary

Arthur Prior,0.8405285477638245,0.7726928591728209,"


Arthur Prior (1914–1969) undertook pioneering work in intensional
logic at a time when modality and intensional concepts in general were
under attack. He invented tense logic and was principal theoretician of
the movement to apply modal syntax to the formalisation of a wide
variety of phenomena. Prior and Carew Meredith devised a version of the
possible worlds semantics several years before Kripke published his
first paper on the topic. An iconoclast and a resourceful innovator,
Prior inspired many to undertake work in intensional logic.


Much of Prior's work consisted of the tireless exploration of a
labyrinth of axiomatic calculi. Yet for him the point of a logical
calculus was always that it had a subject matter, be it time,
obligation, agency, or even biology, and a concern for philosophical
problems never lay far below his theorems. It was the extra-symbolic
world that mattered to Prior, not the formal results per se. He
wrote:
Philosophy, including Logic, is not primarily about
language, but about the real world. … Formalism, i.e. the theory
that Logic is just about symbols and not things, is false.
Nevertheless, it is important to “formalise” as much as we can, i.e. to
state truths about things in a rigorous language with a known and
explicit structure. (1996a: 45)

Prisoner's Dilemma,0.7745504379272461,0.9014681577682496,"


Tanya and Cinque have been arrested for robbing the Hibernia Savings
Bank and placed in separate isolation cells. Both care much more about
their personal freedom than about the welfare of their accomplice. A
clever prosecutor makes the following offer to each. “You may
choose to confess or remain silent. If you confess and your accomplice
remains silent I will drop all charges against you and use your
testimony to ensure that your accomplice does serious time. Likewise,
if your accomplice confesses while you remain silent, they will go
free while you do the time. If you both confess I get two convictions,
but I'll see to it that you both get early parole. If you both remain
silent, I'll have to settle for token sentences on firearms possession
charges. If you wish to confess, you must leave a note with the jailer
before my return tomorrow morning.”


The “dilemma” faced by the prisoners here is that,
whatever the other does, each is better off confessing than remaining
silent. But the outcome obtained when both confess is worse for each
than the outcome they would have obtained had both remained silent. A
common view is that the puzzle illustrates a conflict between
individual and group rationality. A group whose members pursue
rational self-interest may all end up worse off than a group whose
members act contrary to rational self-interest. More generally, if the
payoffs are not assumed to represent self-interest, a group whose
members rationally pursue any goals may all meet less success than if
they had not rationally pursued their goals individually. A closely
related view is that the prisoner's dilemma game and its multi-player
generalizations model familiar situations in which it is difficult to
get rational, selfish agents to cooperate for their common good. Much
of the contemporary literature has focused on identifying conditions
under which players would or should make the “cooperative”
move corresponding to remaining silent. A slightly different
interpretation takes the game to represent a choice between selfish
behavior and socially desirable altruism. The move corresponding to
confession benefits the actor, no matter what the other does, while
the move corresponding to silence benefits the other player no matter
what that other player does. Benefiting oneself is not always wrong,
of course, and benefiting others at the expense of oneself is not
always morally required, but in the prisoner's dilemma game both
players prefer the outcome with the altruistic moves to that with the
selfish moves. This observation has led David Gauthier and others to
take the Prisoner's Dilemma to say something important about the
nature of morality.


Here is another story. Bill has a blue cap and would prefer a red one,
while Rose has a red cap and would prefer a blue one. Both prefer two
caps to any one and either of the caps to no cap at all. They are each
given a choice between keeping the cap they have or giving it to the
other. This “exchange game” has the same structure as the
story about the prisoners. Whether Rose keeps her cap or gives to
Bill, Bill is better off keeping his and she is better off if he gives
it to her. Whether Bill keeps his cap or gives it to Rose, Rose is
better off keeping hers and he is better off if she gives it to
him. But both are better off if they exchange caps than if they both
keep what they have. The new story suggests that the Prisoner's
Dilemma also occupies a place at the heart of our economic system.  It
would seem that any market designed to facilitate mutually beneficial
exchanges will need to overcome the dilemma or avoid it.



Puzzles with the structure of the prisoner's dilemma were devised
and discussed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher in 1950, as part of
the Rand Corporation's investigations into game theory (which Rand
pursued because of possible applications to global nuclear
strategy). The title “prisoner's dilemma” and the version
with prison sentences as payoffs are due to Albert Tucker, who wanted
to make Flood and Dresher's ideas more accessible to an audience of
Stanford psychologists. Although Flood and Dresher didn't themselves
rush to publicize their ideas in external journal articles, the puzzle
has since attracted widespread and increasing attention in a variety
of disciplines. Donninger reports that “more than a thousand
articles” about it were published in the sixties and
seventies. A bibliography (Axelrod and D'Ambrosio) of writings between
1988 and 1994 that pertain to Robert Axelrod's research on the subject
lists 209 entries. A Google Scholar search for
“prisoner's dilemma” in 2014 returns 106,000 results.



The sections below provide a variety of more precise characterizations
of the prisoner's dilemma, beginning with the narrowest, and survey
some connections with similar games and some applications in
philosophy and elsewhere. Particular attention is paid to
“evolutionary” versions of the game in which members of a
population play one another repeatedly and those who get higher
payoffs “reproduce” more rapidly than those who get lower
payoffs. ‘Prisoner's dilemma’ is abbreviated as
‘PD’.

Privacy,0.5328880548477173,0.8822955489158629,"


The term “privacy” is used frequently in ordinary
language as well as in philosophical, political and legal discussions,
yet there is no single definition or analysis or meaning of the term.
The concept of privacy has broad historical roots in sociological and
anthropological discussions about how extensively it is valued and
preserved in various cultures. Moreover, the concept has historical
origins in well known philosophical discussions, most notably
Aristotle’s distinction between the public sphere of political activity
and the private sphere associated with family and domestic life. Yet
historical use of the term is not uniform, and there remains confusion
over the meaning, value and scope of the concept of privacy.


Early treatises on privacy appeared with the development of privacy
protection in American law from the 1890s onward, and privacy
protection was justified largely on moral grounds. This literature
helps distinguish descriptive accounts of privacy, describing
what is in fact protected as private, from normative accounts
of privacy defending its value and the extent to which it should be
protected. In these discussions some treat privacy as an
interest with moral value, while others refer to it as a moral
or legal right that ought to be protected by society or the
law. Clearly one can be insensitive to another’s privacy interests
without violating any right to privacy, if there is one.


There are several skeptical and critical accounts of privacy.
According to one well known argument there is no right to privacy and
there is nothing special about privacy, because any interest protected
as private can be equally well explained and protected by other
interests or rights, most notably rights to property and bodily
security (Thomson, 1975). Other critiques argue that privacy interests
are not distinctive because the personal interests they protect are
economically inefficient (Posner, 1981) or that they are not grounded
in any adequate legal doctrine (Bork, 1990). Finally, there is the
feminist critique of privacy, that granting special status to privacy
is detrimental to women and others because it is used as a shield to
dominate and control them, silence them, and cover up abuse (MacKinnon,
1989).


Nevertheless, most theorists take the view that privacy is a
meaningful and valuable concept. Philosophical debates concerning
definitions of privacy became prominent in the second half of the
twentieth century, and are deeply affected by the development of
privacy protection in the law. Some defend privacy as focusing on
control over information about oneself (Parent, 1983), while others
defend it as a broader concept required for human dignity (Bloustein,
1964), or crucial for intimacy (Gerstein, 1978; Inness, 1992). Other
commentators defend privacy as necessary for the development of varied
and meaningful interpersonal relationships (Fried, 1970, Rachels,
1975), or as the value that accords us the ability to control the
access others have to us (Gavison, 1980; Allen, 1988; Moore, 2003), or
as a set of norms necessary not only to control access but also to
enhance personal expression and choice (Schoeman, 1992), or some
combination of these (DeCew, 1997). Discussion of the concept is
complicated by the fact that privacy appears to be something we value
to provide a sphere within which we can be free from interference by
others, and yet it also appears to function negatively, as the cloak
under which one can hide domination, degradation, or physical harm to
women and others.


This essay will discuss all of these topics, namely, (1) the
historical roots of the concept of privacy, including the development
of privacy protection in tort and constitutional law, and the
philosophical responses that privacy is merely reducible to other
interests or is a coherent concept with fundamental value, (2) the
critiques of privacy as a right, (3) the wide array of philosophical
definitions or defenses of privacy as a concept, providing alternative
views on the meaning and value of privacy (and whether or not it is
culturally relative), as well as (4) the challenges to privacy posed
in an age of technological advance. Overall, most writers defend the
value of privacy protection despite the difficulties inherent in its
definition and its potential use to shield abuse. A contemporary
collection of essays on privacy provides strong evidence to support
this point (Paul et al., 2000). The contributing authors
examine various aspects of the right to privacy and its role in moral
philosophy, legal theory, and public policy. They also address
justifications and foundational arguments for privacy rights.

Private Language,0.862165629863739,0.644019365310669,"


The idea of a private language was made famous in philosophy by 
Ludwig Wittgenstein, who in §243 of his book Philosophical 
Investigations explained it thus: “The words of this 
language are to refer to what can be known only to the speaker; to 
his immediate, private, sensations. So another cannot understand the 
 language.”[1]
 This is not intended to cover (easily imaginable) cases of recording
one's experiences in a personal code, for such a code, however obscure
in fact, could in principle be deciphered. What Wittgenstein had in
mind is a language conceived as necessarily comprehensible
only to its single originator because the things which define its
vocabulary are necessarily inaccessible to others. 


Immediately after introducing the idea, Wittgenstein goes on to argue
that there cannot be such a language. The importance of drawing 
philosophers' attention to a largely unheard-of notion and then 
arguing that it is unrealizable lies in the fact that an unformulated
reliance on the possibility of a private language is arguably 
essential to mainstream epistemology, philosophy of mind and 
metaphysics from Descartes to versions of the representational theory
of mind which became prominent in late twentieth century cognitive 
science.

Probability in Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy,0.7594075202941895,0.8430504798889159,"


Probability-related terminology played an important role in medieval
and Renaissance philosophy. Terms such as ‘probable’
(probabilis), ‘credible’ (credibilis) or
‘truth-like’ (verisimilis) were used to assess
philosophical claims, qualify uncertain conclusions, gauge the force of
arguments and temper academic disagreement. Beyond that, they had a
significant impact on the regulation of legal proceedings, moral action
and everyday life. The probability-related terminology of the Middle
Ages descended from ancient sources such as Aristotle, Cicero and
Boethius. There is no precedent, however, for many medieval ways of
connecting these terms to rules and principles for legal and practical
decision-making.


Medieval scholastic uses of probability evolved into the significantly
different probability discourses of early modern scholasticism and
humanism, which both were finally eclipsed by modern quantitative
notions of probability in the eighteenth century. Much is still unknown
concerning these processes, but a fuller understanding can only be
approached by accounting for their medieval origins. This background is
also important for charting the shifting borders of certainty and
uncertainty, or knowledge and opinion, in European philosophy.

Interpretations of Probability,0.7608199119567871,0.8295605778694153,"


‘Interpreting probability’ is a commonly used but
misleading characterization of a worthy enterprise. The so-called
‘interpretations of probability’ would be better called
‘analyses of various concepts of probability’, and
‘interpreting probability’ is the task of providing such
analyses. Or perhaps better still, if our goal is to transform inexact
concepts of probability familiar to ordinary folk into exact ones
suitable for philosophical and scientific theorizing, then the task may
be one of ‘explication’ in the sense of Carnap (1950).
Normally, we speak of interpreting a formal system, that is,
attaching familiar meanings to the primitive terms in its axioms and
theorems, usually with an eye to turning them into true statements
about some subject of interest. However, there is no single formal
system that is ‘probability’, but rather a host of such
systems. To be sure, Kolmogorov's axiomatization, which we will present
shortly, has achieved the status of orthodoxy, and it is typically what
philosophers have in mind when they think of ‘probability
theory’. Nevertheless, several of the leading
‘interpretations of probability’ fail to satisfy all of
Kolmogorov's axioms, yet they have not lost their title for that.
Moreover, various other quantities that have nothing to do with
probability do satisfy Kolmogorov's axioms, and thus are
interpretations of it in a strict sense: normalized mass, length, area,
volume, and other quantities that fall under the scope of measure
theory, the abstract mathematical theory that generalizes such
quantities. Nobody seriously considers these to be
‘interpretations of probability’, however, because they do
not play the right role in our conceptual apparatus. Instead, we will
be concerned here with various probability-like concepts that
purportedly do. Be all that as it may, we will follow common usage and
drop the cringing scare quotes in our survey of what philosophers have
taken to be the chief interpretations of probability.


Whatever we call it, the project of finding such interpretations is an
important one. Probability is virtually ubiquitous. It plays a role in
almost all the sciences. It underpins much of the social sciences
— witness the prevalent use of statistical testing, confidence
intervals, regression methods, and so on. It finds its way, moreover,
into much of philosophy. In epistemology, the philosophy of mind, and
cognitive science, we see states of opinion being modeled by
subjective probability functions, and learning being modeled by the
updating of such functions. Since probability theory is central to
decision theory and game theory, it has ramifications for ethics and
political philosophy. It figures prominently in such staples of
metaphysics as causation and laws of nature. It appears again in the
philosophy of science in the analysis of confirmation of theories,
scientific explanation, and in the philosophy of specific scientific
theories, such as quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and
genetics. It can even take center stage in the philosophy of logic,
the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of religion. Thus,
problems in the foundations of probability bear at least indirectly,
and sometimes directly, upon central scientific, social scientific,
and philosophical concerns. The interpretation of probability is one
of the most important such foundational problems.

Process Philosophy,0.6797270774841309,0.5103426575660706,"

Process philosophy is based on the premise that being is dynamic and
that the dynamic nature of being should be the primary focus of any
comprehensive philosophical account of reality and our place within
it. Even though we experience our world and ourselves as continuously
changing, Western metaphysics has long been obsessed with describing
reality as an assembly of static individuals whose dynamic features
are either taken to be mere appearances or ontologically secondary and
derivative. For process philosophers the adventure of philosophy
begins with a set of problems that traditional metaphysics
marginalizes or even sidesteps altogether: what is dynamicity or
becoming—if it is the way we experience reality, how
should we interpret this metaphysically? Are there several varieties
of becoming—for instance, the uniform going on of activities
versus the coming about of developments? Do all developments have the
same way of occurring quite independently of what is
coming about? How can we best classify into different kinds
of occurrences what is going on and coming about? How can we
understand the emergence of apparently novel conditions? 

While process philosophers insist that all within and about reality is
continuously going on and coming about, they do not deny that there
are temporally stable and reliably recurrent aspects of reality. But
they take such aspects of persistence to be the regular behavior of
dynamic organizations that arise due to the continuously ongoing
interaction of processes. In order to articulate a process view of
reality, special theoretical efforts are required, however, since the
standard theoretical tools of Western metaphysics are geared to the
static view of reality. Especially the standard interpretation of
predicate logic in terms of static individuals with properties that
are exemplified timelessly or at a temporal instant consolidates what
is from the process-philosophical perspective an unhelpful theoretical
bias. This has forced upon process philosophy a double role as
metaphysical and metaphilosophical enterprise—pushing
for a paradigm change, process philosophy has the double task of
developing new explanatory concepts and providing arguments
for why these concepts better serve the aims of philosophy.

Process philosophy centers on ontology and metaphysics, but it has
full systematic scope: its concern is with the dynamic sense of being
as becoming or occurrence, the conditions of spatio-temporal
existence, the kinds of dynamic entities, the relationship between
mind and world, and the realization of values in action. Some
approaches to process philosophy are conceived on the grand scale and
offer a full-scope metaphysics in the form of a systematic theory or
comprehensive philosophical view. Other approaches, especially more
recent ones, take a more modest approach. They pursue the specific
problems that the various philosophical disciplines are engaged in
while focusing on the dynamic aspects of each sub-domain. Such process
ontologies, process ethics, process epistemologies, process theories
of mind etc. are contributions to ‘process philosophy’
more broadly conceived as a research paradigm of philosophical
inquiry. They share the guiding idea that natural existence consists
in modes of becoming and types of occurrences.
‘Processists’ agree that the world is an assembly of
physical, organic, social, and cognitive processes that interact at
and across levels of dynamic organization. However, within that broad
framework, process philosophers debate about how such a world of
processes is to be construed, how it relates to the human mind (which
is another process) and how the dynamic nature of reality relates to
our scientific theories. In consequence, process philosophers also
differ in their view on the role of philosophy itself and in their
choice of theoretical style.

Process philosophy opposes ‘substance metaphysics,’ the
dominant research paradigm in the history of Western philosophy since
Aristotle. Substance metaphysics proceeds from the
intuition—first formulated by the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher
Parmenides—that being should be thought of as simple, hence as
internally undifferentiated and unchangeable. Substance metaphysicians
recast this intuition as the claim that the primary units of reality
(called “substances”) must be static—they must be
what they are at any instant in time. In contrast to the
substance-metaphysical snapshot view of reality, with its typical
focus on eternalist being and on what there is, process
philosophers analyze becoming and what is occurring as well
as ways of occurring. In some process accounts, becoming is
the mode of being common to the many kinds of occurrences or dynamic
beings. Other process accounts hold that being is ongoing
self-differentiation; on these accounts becoming is both the mode of
being of different kinds of dynamic beings and the process
that generates different kinds of dynamic beings. In order to develop
a taxonomy of dynamic beings (types and modes of occurrences),
processists replace the descriptive concepts of substance metaphysics
with a set of new basic categories. Central among these is the notion
of a basic entity that is individuated in terms of what it
‘does.’ This type of functionally individuated entity is
often labeled ‘process’ in a technical sense of this term
that does not coincide with our common-sense notion of a process. Some
of the ‘processes’ postulated by process philosophers
are—in agreement with our common-sense understanding of
processes—temporal developments that can be analyzed as
temporally structured sequences of stages of an occurrence, with each
such stage being numerically and qualitatively different from any
other. But some of the ‘processes’ that process
philosophers operate with are not temporal developments in this 
sense—they are, for example, temporal but non-developmental
occurrences like activities, or non-spatiotemporal happenings that
realize themselves in a developmental fashion and thereby
constitute the directionality of time. What holds for all dynamic
entities labelled ‘processes,’ however, is that they
occur—that they are somehow or other intimately
connected to time, and often, though not necessarily, related to the
directionality or the passage of time. 

Process philosophers claim that there are many sound philosophical
reasons to take the processual aspects of nature, cognition, and
action as fundamental features of the real. The perhaps most powerful
argument for process philosophy is its wide descriptive or explanatory
scope. If we admit that the basic entities of our world are processes,
we can generate better philosophical descriptions of all the kinds of
entities and relationships we are committed to when we reason about
our world in common sense and in science: from quantum entanglement to
consciousness, from computation to feelings, from things to
institutions, from organisms to societies, from traffic jams to
climate change, from spacetime to beauty. Moreover, results in
cognitive science, some philosophers have claimed, show that we need a
process metaphysics in order to develop a naturalist theory of the
mind and of normativity. These arguments form the background for the
processist criticism of the focus on substance in Western philosophy.
The bias towards substances seems to be rooted partly in the cognitive
dispositions of speakers of Indo-European languages, and partly in
theoretical habituation, as the traditional prioritization of static
entities (substances, objects, states of affairs, static structures)
at the beginning of Western metaphysics built on itself. In contrast,
process philosophy shows fewer affinities to any particular language
group and can allude to a rich tradition of reflection in many of the
great schools of Eastern thought. As recently appeared, process
philosophy also has an increasing practical dimension, since only if
we re-visualize our world as a system of interactions can we come to
grips, conceptually and ethically, with the new phenomena of
artificial life, artificial intelligence, and artificial sociality,
and investigate the exceptionality of human capacities and the scope
of moral obligation. Thus contemporary process philosophy holds out
the promise of offering superior support for the three most pressing
tasks of philosophy at the beginning of the 21st century. First, it
provides the category-theoretic tools for an integrated metaphysics
that can join our common sense and scientific images of the world.
Second, it can serve as a theoretical platform upon which to build an
intercultural philosophy and to facilitate interdisciplinary research
on global knowledge representation by means of an ontological
framework that is no longer parochially Western. Third, it supplies
concepts that facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration on reflected
technology development, and enable the cultural and ethical
imagination needed to shape the expectable deep socio-cultural changes
engendered by the increased use of technology, especially automation.

Process Theism,0.6879096031188965,0.5279868245124817,"


Process theism typically refers to a family of theological ideas
originating in, inspired by, or in agreement with the metaphysical
orientation of the English philosopher-mathematician Alfred North
Whitehead (1861–1947) and the American philosopher-ornithologist
Charles Hartshorne (1897–2000). For both Whitehead and
Hartshorne, it is an essential attribute of God to be fully involved
in and affected by temporal processes. This idea contrasts neatly with
traditional forms of theism that hold God to be or at least conceived
as being, in all respects non-temporal (eternal), unchanging
(immutable,) and unaffected by the world (impassible). Process theism
does not deny that God is in some respects eternal,
immutable, and impassible, but it contradicts the classical view by
insisting that God is in some respects temporal, mutable, and
passible. The views of Whitehead and Hartshorne should also be
distinguished from those that affirm that the divine being, by an act
of self-limitation, opens itself to influence from the world. Some
neo-Thomists hold this view and a group of Evangelical Christian
philosophers, calling themselves “open theists,” promote
similar ideas. These forms of theism were influenced by process
theism, but they deny its claim that God is
essentially in a give-and-take relationship with the world.
Moreover, process theism is a genuinely philosophical
theology in the sense that it is not grounded in claims of special
insight or revealed truth but in philosophical
reflection. Specifically, process theism is a product of theorizing
that takes the categories of becoming, change, and time as
foundational for metaphysics. The metaphysical underpinning of process
theism is often called process philosophy, a label suggested by the
title of Whitehead’s magnum opus,
Process and Reality. In order to bring out this philosophy’s
emphasis on relatedness, many scholars follow Bernard Loomer in calling
it process-relational philosophy. Whitehead’s preferred expression for
his metaphysical viewpoint is “the philosophy of organism.”
This article concerns primarily the concept of God in process theism,
although we shall conclude with a brief discussion of arguments for the
existence of God in process thought.

Proclus,0.6192685961723328,0.087272509932518,"


Proclus of Athens (*412–485 C.E.) was the most authoritative
philosopher of late antiquity and played a crucial role in the
transmission of Platonic philosophy from antiquity to the Middle Ages.
For almost fifty years, he was head or ‘successor’
(diadochos, sc. of Plato) of the Platonic
‘Academy’ in Athens. Being an exceptionally productive
writer, he composed commentaries on Aristotle, Euclid and Plato,
systematic treatises in all disciplines of philosophy as it was at
that time (metaphysics and theology, physics, astronomy, mathematics,
ethics) and exegetical works on traditions of religious wisdom
(Orphism and Chaldaean Oracles). Proclus had a lasting influence on
the development of the late Neoplatonic schools not only in Athens,
but also in Alexandria, where his student Ammonius became the head of
the school.  In a culture dominated by Christianity, the Neoplatonic
philosophers had to defend the superiority of the Hellenic traditions
of wisdom.  Continuing a movement that was inaugurated by Iamblichus
(4th c.) and the charismatic figure of emperor Julian, and
following the teaching of Syrianus, Proclus was eager to demonstrate
the harmony of the ancient religious revelations (the mythologies of
Homer and Hesiod, the Orphic theogonies and the Chaldaean Oracles) and
to integrate them in the philosophical tradition of Pythagoras and
Plato. Towards this end, his Platonic Theology
offers a magisterial summa of pagan Hellenic
theology. Probably the best starting point for the study of Proclus’
philosophy is the Elements of Theology (with the masterly
commentary by E.R. Dodds) which provide a systematic introduction into
the Neoplatonic metaphysical system.

Progress,0.6397324204444885,0.7536869049072266,"

Philosophical proponents of progress assert that the human condition
has improved over the course of history and will continue to improve.
Doctrines of progress first appeared in 18th-century Europe and
epitomize the optimism of that time and place.  Belief in progress
flourished in the 19th century.  While skeptics of progress did exist
alongside its supporters from the beginning, it was not until the 20th
century that theorists backed away en masse from the notion.  Many
20th-century thinkers rejected the notion of progress after horrendous
events such as the two World Wars, the Holocaust, and the use of
nuclear weaponry.


In general, writings on progress tend to bear a close relationship to
the environment in which they were produced.  Because of the strong
connection between doctrines of progress and historical events, this
article is organized by time and place.  However, that principle of
organization does not mean that each doctrine should not be assessed
on its own merits.  To help the reader, the next section briefly
summarizes the conceptual framework that is used throughout the rest
of the article.

Promises,0.4075487554073334,0.7740810513496399,"


Few moral judgments are more intuitively obvious and more widely
shared than that promises ought to be kept. It is in part this fixed
place in our intuitive judgments that makes promises of particular
interest to philosophers, as well as a host of social scientists and
other theorists. Promises are of special interest to ethical theorists,
as they are generally taken to impose moral obligations. Thus an
explanation of how such promissory obligations come about and how they
function is necessary for a complete moral theory.


Another feature of promises that make them a topic of philosophical
concern is their role in producing trust, and by so doing facilitating
social coordination and cooperation. For this reason promises and
related phenomena, such as vows, oaths, pledges, contracts, treaties
and agreements more generally are important elements of justice and the
law, and, at least in the Social Contract tradition, of the political
order as well.


The philosophical work on these topics is body of literature that
spans the ages. Although promising as a phenomenon is rarely the sole
subject of a major work, it is quite often a subject treated by
important authors, and many major figures have written on it. 
From Aristotle to Aquinas, from Hobbes to Hume, from Kant to Mill, from
Ross to Rawls to Scanlon, an explanation of the promissory obligation
has been a live question.


While the bulk of the corpus is in ethical and political theory and
the related fields of legal theory and applied ethics, work on promises
has also been done in the philosophy of language, action theory,
rationality theory, game theory and other areas.

Proof Theory,0.899610698223114,0.7857948541641235,"

Proof theory is not an esoteric technical subject that was invented to
support a formalist doctrine in the philosophy of mathematics; rather,
it has been developed as an attempt to analyze aspects of mathematical
experience and to isolate, possibly overcome, methodological problems
in the foundations of mathematics. The origins of those problems,
forcefully and sometimes contentiously formulated in the 1920s, are
traceable to the transformation of mathematics in the nineteenth
century: the emergence of abstract mathematics, its reliance on set
theoretic notions, and its focus on logic in a broad, foundational
sense. Substantive issues came to the fore already in the mathematical
work and the foundational essays of Dedekind and Kronecker; they
concerned the legitimacy of undecidable concepts, the existence of
infinite mathematical objects, and the sense of non-constructive
proofs of existential statements.

In an attempt to mediate between conflicting foundational positions,
Hilbert shifted issues, already around 1900, from a mathematical to a
vaguely conceived metamathematical level. That approach was rigorously
realized in the 1920s, when he took advantage of the possibility of
formalizing mathematics in deductive systems and investigated the
underlying formal frames from a strictly constructive,
“finitist” standpoint. Hilbert’s approach raised
fascinating metamathematical questions—from semantic
completeness through mechanical decidability to syntactic
incompleteness; however, the hoped-for mathematical resolution of the
foundational issues was not achieved. The failure of his finitist
consistency program raised and deepened equally fascinating
methodological questions. A broadened array of problems with only
partial solutions has created a vibrant subject that spans
computational, mathematical, and philosophical issues—with a
rich history.

The main part of our article covers these exciting investigations for
an expanded Hilbert Program through 1999—with special, detailed
attention to results and techniques that by now can be called
“classical” and are of continued interest. Newer, but
still closely connected developments are sketched in Appendices: the
proof theory of set theories in Appendix D combinatorial
independence results in Appendix E, and provably total
functions in Appendix F. Here (infinitary) sequent calculi and
suitable systems of ordinal notations are crucial proof theoretic
tools. However, we discuss in section 4.2 also Gödel’s
Dialectica Interpretation and some of its extensions as an alternative
for obtaining relative consistency proofs and describe in section
5.2.1 the systematic attempt of completing the incomplete through
recursive progressions. Both topics are analyzed further in Appendix
C.2 and Appendix B, respectively. To complete this bird’s eye
view of our article, we mention that the Epilogue, section 6,
not only indicates further proof theoretic topics, but also some
directions of current research that are connected to proof theory and
of deep intrinsic interest. We have tried to convey the vibrancy of a
subject that thrives on concrete computational and (meta-)
mathematical work, but also invites and is grounded in general
philosophical reflection.

Intellectual Property,0.4520825147628784,0.7453699111938477,"


Intellectual property is generally characterized as non-physical
property that is the product of original thought. Typically, rights do
not surround the abstract non-physical entity; rather, intellectual
property rights surround the control of physical manifestations or
expressions of ideas. Intellectual property law protects a
content-creator's interest in her ideas by assigning and enforcing
legal rights to produce and control physical instantiations of those
ideas.


Legal protections for intellectual property have a rich history that
stretches back to ancient Greece and before. As different legal
systems matured in protecting intellectual works, there was a
refinement of what was being protected within different areas.
Over the same period several strands of moral justification for
intellectual property were offered: namely, personality-based,
utilitarian, and Lockean. Finally, there have been numerous
critics of intellectual property and systems of intellectual property
protection. This essay will discuss all of these topics, focusing
on Anglo-American and European legal and moral conceptions of
intellectual property.

Prophecy,0.7131584882736206,0.6178032159805298,"

A prophet is a person who plays as special role mediating the
relationship between other people and the divine. People typically
envision prophecy in terms of God communicating through a prophet to
others some important information that could not have been known to
the prophet in any ordinary way. Prophecy is interesting from a
philosophical point of view for many reasons, including the fact that
it raises compelling questions about divine knowledge and
communication, human language, the nature of time, and human freedom.
Unlike theologians or apologists, philosophers rarely argue about who
has actually prophesied what, or whether or not a given prophecy came
true. Instead, they prefer to argue about ideal cases, where the
theoretical issues can be clearly identified. In this article, we will
follow their lead by sidestepping completely the question of whether
or not any apparent prophecies have actually been fulfilled. We will
also avoid the question of the existence of God, which is addressed by
a number of other entries in this encyclopedia (see the entries listed
in the Related Entries section below).

Propositional Attitude Reports,0.7963095307350159,0.6802911162376404,"


Propositional attitude reports concern the cognitive relations people
bear to propositions. We typically make such reports by uttering
propositional attitude reporting sentences like ‘Jill believes
that Jack broke his crown’, employing a
propositional attitude verb like ‘believes, ‘hopes’,
and ‘knows’, followed by a clause that includes a full
sentence expressing a proposition (a
that-clause). Attributions of cognitive relations to
propositions can also take other forms. For example, ‘Jack
believes what Jill said’ and ‘Jack believes everything
Jill believes’ are both propositional attitude ascriptions. Some
also claim that ‘Jill wanted Jack to fall’, ‘Jack
and Jill are seeking water’, and ‘Jack fears Jill’,
for example, are to be analyzed as propositional attitude ascribing
sentences, the first saying, perhaps, something to the effect that
Jill wants that Jack falls, the second that Jack and Jill
strive that they find water, and the third that Jack fears
that Jill will hurt him. But such analyses are
controversial. (See the entry on
 intensional transitive verbs.)


In this discussion, we will examine attempts to deal with a puzzle
about propositional attitude reporting sentences that was first posed
by Gottlob Frege in his 1892. Subsequent literature has been concerned
with developing a semantic theory that deals satisfactorily with this
puzzle. We will explore some of these theories and note some of the
problems they face.


Having a successful theory of propositional attitude reports is
important, as they serve as a converging point for a number of
different fields, including philosophy of language, natural language
semantics, philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and epistemology.

Propositional Function,0.8577796816825867,0.7122887969017029,"

As the name suggests, propositional functions are functions that have
propositions as their values. Propositional functions have played an
important role in modern logic, from their beginnings in Frege's
theory of concepts and their analyses in Russell's works, to their
appearance in very general guise in contemporary type theory and
categorial grammar.
In this article, I give an historical overview of the use of
propositional functions in logical theory and of views about their
nature and ontological status.

Propositions,0.801521897315979,0.6564205288887024,"


The term ‘proposition’ has a broad use in contemporary
philosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the
primary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other
“propositional attitudes” (i.e., what is believed, doubted,
 etc.[1]), 
the referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of
sentences.


One might wonder whether a single class of entities can play all
these roles. If David Lewis (1986, p. 54) is right in saying that
“the conception we associate with the word
‘proposition’ may be something of a jumble of conflicting
desiderata,” then it will be impossible to capture our
conception in a consistent definition.


The best way to proceed, when dealing with quasi-technical words
like ‘proposition’, may be to stipulate a definition and
proceed with caution, making sure not to close off any substantive
issues by definitional fiat.


Propositions, we shall say, are the sharable objects of the
attitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This
stipulation rules out certain candidates for propositions, including
thought- and utterance-tokens, which presumably are not sharable, and
concrete events or facts, which presumably cannot be false. These
consequences fit well with contemporary usage. Our definition leaves
open many of the questions dividing propositionalists: which additional
roles are propositions fit to play? would propositions have to be
mind-independent or abstract? what individuation conditions would they
have? how would they relate to facts? We examine these issues below, as
well as the fundamental issue of whether there are propositions at all.

Singular Propositions,0.7979832291603088,0.650188148021698,"
 Singular propositions (also called ‘‘Russellian
propositions’’) are propositions that are about a
particular individual in virtue of having that individual as a direct
constituent. This characterization assumes a structured view of
propositions —
  see propositions: structured.
Alleged examples of singular propositions are the propositions [Mont
Blanc is more than 4,000 meters high], [Socrates was wise], and [She
(pointing at Susan) lives in New York]. A singular proposition is to
be contrasted with a general proposition, which is not about
any particular individual, and a particularized proposition,
which is about a particular individual but does not contain that
individual as a constituent. Examples of the first are the
propositions [Most Americans favor tax cuts] and [Some music is
great]; examples of the second are the propositions [The inventor of
bifocals was bald] and [The tallest spy is a man]. A singular
proposition is directly about an individual whereas a
particularized proposition is indirectly about an individual
in virtue of that object satisfying a condition that is a constituent
of the proposition — in our cases, the conditions
‘x uniquely invented bifocals’ and
‘x is a tallest spy’.


The acceptance or rejection of singular propositions lies at the
center of many issues in semantics, the philosophy of language and
mind, and metaphysics. In this essay, we shall look at some of the
arguments for singular propositions, discuss problems their existence
give rise to, and show how singular propositions are related to
certain questions in metaphysics.

Structured Propositions,0.8010931611061096,0.6578887104988098,"


It is a truism that two speakers can say the same thing by uttering
different sentences, whether in the same or different
languages. For example, when a German speaker utters the sentence
‘Schnee ist weiss’ and an English speaker utters the
sentence ‘Snow is white’, they have said the same thing by
uttering the sentences they did. Proponents of propositions hold
that, speaking strictly, when speakers say the same thing by means of
different declarative sentences, there is some (non-linguistic) thing,
a proposition, that each has 
 said.[1] 
 This proposition
is said to be expressed by both of the sentences uttered (taken in the
contexts of utterance—to accommodate contextually sensitive
expressions) by the speakers, and can be thought of as the information
content of the sentences (taken in those contexts). The
proposition is taken to be the thing that is in the first instance true
or false. A declarative sentence is true or false derivatively,
in virtue of expressing (in the context in which it is
uttered—this contextual sensitivity shall henceforth be ignored
and so qualifications of this sort dispensed with) a true or false
proposition.


Propositions are thought to perform a number of other functions in
addition to being the bearers of truth and falsity and the things
expressed by declarative sentences. When a German and English
speaker believe the same thing, say that the earth is round, the thing
they both believe is not a sentence but a proposition. For the
English speaker would express her belief by means of the sentence
‘The earth is round’ and the German speaker would express
her belief by means of the different sentence ‘Die Erde ist
rund’. Thus when people believe, doubt and know things, it
is propositions that they bear these cognitive relations to.
Finally, it is the proposition a sentence expresses, and not the
sentence itself, that possesses modal properties such as being
necessary, possible or contingent.


That propositions perform these various functions is agreed upon by
virtually all advocates of 
 propositions.[2] 
 There is
considerably less agreement concerning the nature of the things,
propositions, that perform these 
 functions.[3]


To say that propositions are structured is to say something about
the nature of propositions. Roughly, to say that propositions are
structured is to say that they are complex entities, entities having
parts or constituents, where the constituents are bound together in a
certain way. Thus, particular accounts of structured propositions can
(and do) differ in at least two ways: 1) they can differ as to what
sorts of things are the constituents of structured propositions; and 2)
they can differ as to what binds these constituents together in a
proposition. Various accounts of structured propositions that
differ in these ways will be discussed below.


Put this way, the view that propositions are structured is purely a
metaphysical thesis about what propositions are like and entails
nothing about the relation between a sentence and the proposition it
expresses. But of course structured proposition theorists do have
views about the relation between a sentence and the proposition it
expresses.

Ancient Theories of Soul,0.6194013357162476,0.2080881446599961,"


Ancient philosophical theories of soul are in many respects sensitive
to ways of speaking and thinking about the soul [psuchê]
that are not specifically philosophical or theoretical. We therefore
begin with what the word ‘soul’ meant to speakers of
Classical Greek, and what it would have been natural to think about
and associate with the soul. We then turn to various Presocratic
thinkers, and to the philosophical theories that are our primary
concern, those of Plato (first in the Phaedo, then in the
Republic), Aristotle (in the De Anima or On the
Soul), Epicurus, and the Stoics.  These are by far the most
carefully worked out theories of soul in ancient philosophy.  Later
theoretical developments — for instance, in the writings of
Plotinus and other Platonists, as well as the Church Fathers —
are best studied against the background of the classical theories,
from which, in large part, they derive.

 Adopting a bird's-eye view of the terrain that we will be covering,
and setting many details aside for the moment, we can describe it as
follows. From comparatively humble Homeric beginnings, the word
‘soul’ undergoes quite remarkable semantic expansion in
sixth and fifth century usage.  By the end of the fifth century
— the time of Socrates' death — soul is standardly thought
and spoken of, for instance, as the distinguishing mark of living
things, as something that is the subject of emotional states and that
is responsible for planning and practical thinking, and also as the
bearer of such virtues as courage and justice. Coming to philosophical
theory, we first trace a development towards comprehensive
articulation of a very broad conception of soul, according to which
the soul is not only responsible for mental or psychological functions
like thought, perception and desire, and is the bearer of moral
qualities, but in some way or other accounts for all the vital
functions that any living organism performs. This broad conception,
which is clearly in close contact with ordinary Greek usage by that
time, finds its fullest articulation in Aristotle's theory. The
theories of the Hellenistic period, by contrast, are interested more
narrowly in the soul as something that is responsible specifically for
mental or psychological functions. They either de-emphasize or sever
the ordinary-language connection between soul and life in all its
functions and aspects.

Philosophical discussions of mental illness fall into three
families. First, there are topics that arise when we treat psychiatry
as a special science and deal with it using the methods and concepts of
philosophy of science. This includes discussion of such issues as
explanation, reduction and classification. Second, there are conceptual
issues that arise when we try to understand the very idea of mental
illness and its ethical and experiential dimensions. Third, there are
interactions between psychopathology and the philosophy of mind;
philosophers have used clinical phenomena to illuminate issues in the
philosophy of mind, and philosophical findings to try to understand
mental illness. This entry will discuss issues in the philosophy of
science and philosophy of mind that pertain to psychiatry.

Psychologism,0.7081446051597595,0.46365886926651,"


Many authors use the term ‘psychologism’ for what they
perceive as the mistake of identifying non-psychological with
psychological entities. For instance, philosophers who think that
logical laws are not psychological laws would view it as psychologism
to identify the two. Other authors use the term in a neutral
descriptive or even in a positive sense. ‘Psychologism’
then refers (approvingly) to positions that apply psychological
techniques to traditional philosophical problems (e.g. Ellis 1979,
1990).


‘Psychologism’ entered the English language as a
translation of the German word ‘Psychologismus’, a
term coined by the Hegelian Johann Eduard Erdmann in 1870 to critically
characterize the philosophical position of Eduard Beneke (Erdmann
1870).


Although the term continues to be used today, criticisms and defenses
of psychologism have mostly been absorbed into wider debates over the
pros and cons of philosophical naturalism. Therefore I shall here
focus on a time when, and a place where, psychologism was still a
much-debated distinct issue.

Publicity,0.4734260737895966,0.6723598837852478,"

Publicity can be opposed both to privacy and to secrecy. This entry
will mostly be dealing with the latter meaning. In everyday life,
calls for more transparency or openness in political and economic life
may seem rather uncontroversial. Still, the precise reasons why and
the extent to which publicity should be guaranteed are not
straightforward. Moral and political philosophers, along with social
scientists, have until now provided us with only fragmentary elements
in this respect. We shall review here what has been gathered so
far.

This entry unfolds in three parts. We start with hypothetical
publicity, and singularly with Immanuel Kant’s publicity test,
contrasting his position with the one of Henry Sidgwick and looking
both at the justification and implications of the Kantian test
 (§1).
 More precisely, our focus in this first part will be on two
questions. First, what (if anything) justifies the importance of this
test? Second,what are its implications for moral and political
philosophy in general and for actual publicity in particular?
Hypothetical publicity may appear to some readers as the only
genuinely philosophical development on publicity, which justifies 
why we will examine it first.

We then look more closely at actual publicity, focusing on
two moments of our political life (voting and deliberation) and two of
its actors (citizens and representatives)
 (§2).
 Authors such as John Stuart Mill and Jon Elster will be our guides
here. Secret ballots have not always been the rule. Hence, shifting
away from open vote gave rise to fascinating debates, especially in
the British 19th century. We then move to the analysis of reasons for
and against public deliberation, Elster’s argument from the civilizing
force of hypocrisy being our starting point here. At least two central
questions should be kept in mind while reading this second part of the
entry. First, are the arguments in favor of open/secret voting
different from those in favor of open/secret deliberation? Second, how
much weight should be attached, in philosophical arguments about
publicity, to empirical claims, and have philosophers paid enough
attention to relevant empirical complexities?

In the third section, we introduce the reader to a few
dimensions of the concept of publicity as it is used in John Rawls’s
work. As for many other questions, Rawls has revived the topic. The
ideas of “public rules” and “public reason”
have now become important in political philosophy. We shall briefly
present and discuss them.
",https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/publicity/,,None
Public Reason,0.4684028327465058,0.6757951974868774,"

Public reason requires that the moral or political rules that regulate
our common life be, in some sense, justifiable or acceptable to all
those persons over whom the rules purport to have authority. It is an
idea with roots in the work of Hobbes, Kant, and Rousseau, and has
become increasingly influential in contemporary moral and political
philosophy as a result of its development in the work of John Rawls,
Jürgen Habermas, and Gerald Gaus, among others. Proponents of
public reason often present the idea as an implication of a particular
conception of persons as free and equal. Each of us is free in the
sense of not being naturally subject to any other person’s moral
or political authority, and we are equally situated with respect to
this freedom from the natural authority of others. How, then, can some
moral or political rules be rightly imposed on all of us, particularly
if we assume deep and permanent disagreement amongst persons about
matters of value, morality, religion, and the good life? The answer,
for proponents of public reason, is that such rules can rightly be
imposed on persons when the rules can be justified by appeal to ideas
or arguments that those persons, at some level of idealization,
endorse or accept. But public reason is not only a standard by which
moral or political rules can be assessed: it can also provide
standards for individual behavior. Because we make moral and political
demands of each other, if we are to comply with the ideal of public
reason, we must refrain from advocating or supporting rules that
cannot be justified to those on whom the rules would be imposed. We
should instead, some insist, only support those rules we sincerely
believe can be justified by appeal to suitably shared or public
considerations—for example, widely endorsed political values
such as freedom and equality—and abstain from appealing to
religious arguments, or other controversial views over which
reasonable people are assumed to disagree. In this way, public reason
can be presented as a standard for assessing rules, laws,
institutions, and the behavior of individual citizens and public
officials.

This entry is structured around questions about the nature of public
reason that continue to be the subject of sustained debate in the
literature. Section 1 considers competing positions regarding the
underlying rationale for public reason. Section 2 identifies different
views about the appropriate scope of public reason. Does it apply to
all moral rules, only to political rules, or only to some sub-set of
political rules? Section 3 considers the question of public
reason’s constituency: to whom must our rules be justifiable in
order to be considered legitimate or authoritative? The next question,
in section 4, concerns the content of public reason; in particular, to
what extent is this content determined via a process of philosophical
reflection as opposed to actual moral deliberation? Section 5
considers the structure of public reason, with particular focus on
whether public reason requires some shared perspective or set of
considerations, or whether it can be achieved without any common moral
or political perspective. Section 6 addresses the site of public
reason: where do its norms properly apply and when do they regulate
individual conduct? Section 7 identifies some of the most influential
objections that have been pressed against the idea of public reason,
and Section 8 concludes with a brief survey of a few further
topics.

Pufendorf's Moral and Political Philosophy,0.4783982038497925,0.5872951149940491,"
 Samuel Freiherr von Pufendorf (1632–1694) was almost as
unknown during most of the 19th and 20th centuries as he had been
familiar during the preceding hundred years and more. His fate shows
well how philosophical interests shape historical background
narratives. More or less consciously, individual thinkers and the
traditions they spawn frame themselves in terms of an edited past
which – as in other forms of genealogy – they either
appropriate, reject, revise, or ignore. Thus intellectual ancestry is
always more controversial than biological inheritance, and the mere
presence or absence of thinkers in particular developmental accounts
is not necessarily an accurate indication of their actual historical
role or importance.


Pufendorf’s thought is situated in post-Westphalian Europe, as the
Holy Roman Empire underwent a reconfiguration of power relationships
among its quasi-autonomous constituent states (Austria, Bavaria,
Palatinate, Saxony, Brandenburg, and others), while maintaining a
guarded posture toward external, competing powers such as France,
England, the United Provinces, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, and Spain. Its
main goals were to avoid relapse into confessional warfare, and to
ward off the respective French and Ottoman threats on its western and
eastern borders. In this context Pufendorf developed a theory about
the moral relationships of agents (individuals and groups), the
authority and duties of states, and the lawful interactions among
these. His chief objective, too, was to avoid destructive social
conflict and the devolution on any level into the antagonistic and, he
thought, self-defeating condition known as the state of nature.
 Pufendorf’s approach was secular, non-metaphysical, and
anti-authoritarian; it eschewed religious appeals, scholastic dogma,
essentialism, teleology, and the frequent mix of these that appealed
to many German thinkers, Catholic and Protestant alike. Instead, it
built on Bodin, Lipsius, Grotius, Hobbes, and the Italian
reason-of-state tradition.  Because of it, Pufendorf is known as a
voluntarist in ethics, a sovereignty theorist in politics, and a
realist in international relations theory. His kind of natural law is
called ‘modern’ or ‘Protestant’ (Tuck 1987,
Haakonssen 2004), in contrast to the metaphysical, neoscholastic,
rationalist, or even Platonic version of the genre represented not
only by the School of Salamanca (Suarez, Vitoria) but also Leibniz and
then Wolff. Known as a philosopher and a jurist, Pufendorf was also a
respected historian whose accounts of (mostly, the external relations

concepts. He wrote notably on church-state relations, on intellectual
and religious toleration, and on the Baconian theme of innovation in
philosophy. Because of the clarity and comprehensiveness of his works,
their intellectual acuity, and their polemical edge and consequent
notoriety, they were translated into many European languages and thus
provided – often in the form of pedagogical tools – many of
the basic concepts and distinctions operative in the 18th-century
discourse about morality, society, politics, history, and
international affairs. Indeed, both directly and through his many
editors, translators, and imitators, Pufendorf was largely responsible

Punishment,0.3700910210609436,0.7432530522346497,"


The concept of punishment—its definition—and its practical
application and justification during the past half-century have shown a
marked drift away from efforts to reform and rehabilitate offenders in
favor of retribution and incarceration. Punishment in its very
conception is now acknowledged to be an inherently retributive
practice, whatever may be the further role of retribution as a (or the)
justification or goal of punishment. A liberal justification of
punishment would proceed by showing that society needs the threat and
the practice of punishment, because the goal of social order cannot be
achieved otherwise and because it is unfair to expect victims of
criminal aggression to bear the cost of their victimization.
Constraints on the use of threatened punishments (such as due process
of law) are of course necessary, given the ways in which authority and
power can be abused. Such a justification involves both deontological
as well as consequentialist considerations.

Pythagoras,0.6874493360519409,0.04058991000056267,"


Pythagoras, one of the most famous and controversial ancient Greek
philosophers, lived from ca. 570 to ca. 490 BCE. He spent his early
years on the island of Samos, off the coast of modern Turkey. At the
age of forty, however, he emigrated to the city of Croton in southern
Italy and most of his philosophical activity occurred
there. Pythagoras wrote nothing, nor were there any detailed accounts
of his thought written by contemporaries. By the first centuries BCE,
moreover, it became fashionable to present Pythagoras in a largely
unhistorical fashion as a semi-divine figure, who originated all that
was true in the Greek philosophical tradition, including many of
Plato's and Aristotle's mature ideas. A number of treatises were
forged in the name of Pythagoras and other Pythagoreans in order to
support this view.

  The Pythagorean question, then, is how to get behind this false
glorification of Pythagoras in order to determine what the historical
Pythagoras actually thought and did. In order to obtain an accurate
appreciation of Pythagoras' achievement, it is important to rely on
the earliest evidence before the distortions of the later tradition
arose. The popular modern image of Pythagoras is that of a master
mathematician and scientist. The early evidence shows, however, that,
while Pythagoras was famous in his own day and even 150 years later in
the time of Plato and Aristotle, it was not mathematics or science
upon which his fame rested. Pythagoras was famous (1) as an expert on
the fate of the soul after death, who thought that the soul was
immortal and went through a series of reincarnations; (2) as an expert
on religious ritual; (3) as a wonder-worker who had a thigh of gold
and who could be two places at the same time; (4) as the founder of a
strict way of life that emphasized dietary restrictions, religious
ritual and rigorous self discipline. 

 It remains controversial whether he also engaged in the rational
cosmology that is typical of the Presocratic philosopher/scientists
and whether he was in any sense a mathematician. The early evidence
suggests, however, that Pythagoras presented a cosmos that was
structured according to moral principles and significant numerical
relationships and may have been akin to conceptions of the cosmos
found in Platonic myths, such as those at the end of the
Phaedo and Republic. In such a cosmos, the planets
were seen as instruments of divine vengeance (“the hounds of
Persephone”), the sun and moon are the isles of the blessed
where we may go, if we live a good life, while thunder functioned to
frighten the souls being punished in Tartarus. The heavenly bodies
also appear to have moved in accordance with the mathematical ratios
that govern the concordant musical intervals in order to produce a
music of the heavens, which in the later tradition developed into
“the harmony of the spheres.” It is doubtful that
Pythagoras himself thought in terms of spheres, and the mathematics of
the movements of the heavens was not worked out in detail.  There is
evidence that he valued relationships between numbers such as those
embodied in the so-called Pythagorean theorem, though it is not likely
that he proved the theorem. In recent scholarship this consensus view
has received strong challenges, which will be discussed below.

  Pythagoras' cosmos was developed in a more scientific and
mathematical direction by his successors in the Pythagorean tradition,
Philolaus and Archytas. Pythagoras succeeded in promulgating a new
more optimistic view of the fate of the soul after death and in
founding a way of life that was attractive for its rigor and
discipline and that drew to him numerous devoted followers.

Pythagoreanism,0.6881622672080994,0.040177788585424416,"


Pythagoreanism can be defined in a number of ways.


(1) Pythagoreanism is the philosophy of the ancient Greek
philosopher
 Pythagoras
 (ca. 570 – ca. 490
BCE), which prescribed a highly structured way of life and espoused the
doctrine of metempsychosis (transmigration of the soul after death into
a new body, human or animal).


(2) Pythagoreanism is the philosophy of a group of philosophers
active in the fifth and the first half of the fourth century BCE, whom
Aristotle refers to as “the so-called Pythagoreans” and to
whom Plato also refers. Aristotle's expression, “so-called
Pythagoreans,” suggests both that at his time this group of
thinkers was commonly called Pythagoreans and, at the same time, calls
into question the actual connection between these thinkers and
Pythagoras himself. Aristotle ascribes no specific names to these
Pythagoreans, but the philosophy which he assigns to them is very
similar to what is found in the fragments of
 Philolaus
 of Croton (ca. 470-ca. 390 BCE).
Thus, Philolaus and his successor Eurytus are likely to have been the
most prominent of these Pythagoreans. Philolaus posits limiters and
unlimiteds as first principles and emphasizes the role of number in
understanding the cosmos. Aristotle also identifies a distinct group of
these so-called Pythagoreans who formulated a set of basic principles
known as the table of opposites. Plato's sole reference to Pythagoreans
cites their search for the numerical structure of contemporary music
and is probably an allusion to
 Archytas
 (ca.
420-ca. 350 BCE), who is the first great mathematician in the
Pythagorean tradition. Starting from the system of Philolaus he
developed his own sophisticated account of the world in terms of
mathematical proportion.


(3) Many other sixth-, fifth- and fourth-century thinkers are labeled
Pythagoreans in the Greek tradition after the fourth century BCE. By
the late fourth century CE many of the most prominent Greek
philosophers including Parmenides, Plato and Aristotle come to be
called Pythagoreans, with no historical justification. There are
nonetheless a number of thinkers of the fifth and fourth century BCE,
who can legitimately be called Pythagoreans, although often little is
known about them except their names. The most important of these
figures is Hippasus. What criterion should be used to identify an
early figure as a Pythagorean is controversial and there is debate
about individual cases. Fourth-century evidence shows that
Pythagoreanism gave an unusually large role to women for an ancient
philosophhical school. It is likely that the Pythagorean communities
that practiced a way of life that they traced back to Pythagoras died
out in the middle of the fourth century BCE. 


(4) The last manifestation of Pythagoreanism, Neopythagoreanism, has
been the most influential. Neopythagoreanism is not a unified school of
thought but rather a tendency, stretching over many centuries, to view
Pythagoras, with no historical justification, as the central and
original figure in the whole Greek philosophical tradition. This
Pythagoras is often thought to have received his philosophy as a divine
revelation, which had been given even earlier to wise men of the
ancient Near East such as the Persian Magi, the Hebrews (Moses in
particular), and the Egyptian priests. All Greek philosophy after
Pythagoras, insofar as it may be true, is seen as derived from this
revelation. Thus, Plato's and Aristotle's ideas are viewed as derived
from Pythagoras (with the mediation of other early Pythagoreans). Many
pseudepigrapha are produced in later times in order to provide the
Pythagorean “originals” on which Plato and Aristotle drew.
Some strands of the Neopythagorean tradition emphasize Pythagoras as
master metaphysician, who supposedly originated what are, in fact, the
principles of Plato's later metaphysics, the one and the indefinite
dyad. Other Neopythagoreans celebrate Pythagoras as the founder of the
quadrivium of mathematical sciences (arithmetic, geometry,
astronomy and music), while still others portray him as a magician or
as a religious expert and sage, upon whom we should model our lives.
Neopythagoreanism probably began already in the second half of the fourth
century BCE among Plato's first successors in the Academy, but
particularly flourished from the first century BCE until the end of
antiquity. Neopythagoreanism has close connections to Middle and
Neoplatonism and from the time of Iamblichus (4th c. CE) is largely
absorbed into Neoplatonism. It was the Neopythagorean version of
Pythagoreanism that dominated in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

Qualia,0.7572423219680786,0.4298125207424164,"

Feelings and experiences vary widely. For example, I run my fingers
over sandpaper, smell a skunk, feel a sharp pain in my finger, seem to
see bright purple, become extremely angry. In each of these cases, I
am the subject of a mental state with a very distinctive subjective
character. There is something it is like for me to undergo
each state, some phenomenology that it has. Philosophers often use the
term ‘qualia’ (singular ‘quale’) to refer to
the introspectively accessible, phenomenal aspects of our mental
lives. In this broad sense of the term, it is difficult to deny that
there are qualia. Disagreement typically centers on which mental
states have qualia, whether qualia are intrinsic qualities of their
bearers, and how qualia relate to the physical world both inside and
outside the head. The status of qualia is hotly debated in philosophy
largely because it is central to a proper understanding of the nature
of consciousness. Qualia are at the very heart of the mind-body
problem. 

The entry that follows is divided into ten sections. The first
distinguishes various uses of the term ‘qualia’. The
second addresses the question of which mental states have qualia. The
third section brings out some of the main arguments for the view that
qualia are irreducible and non-physical. The remaining sections focus
on functionalism and qualia, the explanatory gap, qualia and
introspection, representational theories of qualia, qualia as
intrinsic, nonrepresentational properties, relational theories of
qualia and finally the issue of qualia and simple minds.

The knowledge argument aims to establish that conscious experience
involves non-physical properties. It rests on the idea that someone who
has complete physical knowledge about another conscious being might yet
lack knowledge about how it feels to have the experiences of that
being. It is one of the most discussed arguments against

Tropes,0.7534871101379395,0.5635073184967041,"

Trope theory is the view that reality is (wholly or partly) made up
from tropes. Tropes are things like the particular shape, weight, and
texture of an individual object. Because tropes are particular, for
two objects to ‘share’ a property (for them both to
exemplify, say, a particular shade of green) is for each to contain
(instantiate, exemplify) a greenness-trope, where those
greenness-tropes, although numerically distinct, nevertheless exactly
resemble each other.

Apart from this very thin core assumption—that there are
tropes—different trope theories need not have very much in
 common.[1]
 Most trope theorists (but not all) believe
that—fundamentally—there is nothing but tropes. Most trope
theorists (but, again, not all) hold that resemblance between concrete
particulars is to be explained in terms of resemblance between their
respective tropes. And most (but not all) hold that resemblance
between tropes is determined by their primitive intrinsic nature.

That there are tropes seems prima facie reasonable if we
reflect on such things as perception (I don’t see color in
general, but the color of this object) and causation (it’s the
weight of this object that leaves an impression in the palm of my
hand, not weight in general). Yet, neither perception nor causation
manage to distinguish between a theory positing tropes and one
positing, e.g., states of affairs (universal-exemplifications), which
means that the support they provide in favor of tropes is weak at
best. Prima facie reasons to one side, no matter which terms
they use to characterize their posits, most trope theorists agree that
tropes occupy a ‘middle position’ in between universal
realism and classical nominalism, something they believe allows them
to reap all the benefits of both of those views without having to
suffer any of their disadvantages. More precisely, in accepting the
existence of properties (or, at least, something
‘property-like’), the trope theorist accepts an ontology
that is fine-grained enough to be able to explain how distinct
concrete particulars can be simultaneously similar to, and different
from, each other (something the classical nominalist arguably fails to
do, cf. Armstrong 1978). And in rejecting the existence of
universals, she avoids having to accept the existence of a kind of
entity many find mysterious, counterintuitive, and
‘unscientific’ (Schaffer 2001: 249f; Molnar 2003:
22–25; and Armstrong 2005: 310).

In this entry, reasons both for and against the existence of tropes
are surveyed. As we shall see, what those reasons are, and how well
they manage to support (or cause trouble for) the trope-theoretical
thesis, depends on which version of the trope view they concern. Much
of the entry will therefore be dedicated to distinguishing different
versions of the theory from each other, and to see what costs and
benefits adopting either version brings with it.

Quantifiers and Quantification,0.8593052625656128,0.7858646512031555,"
Quantifier expressions are marks of generality. They come in a
variety of syntactic categories in English, but determiners like
“all”, “each”, “some”,
“many”, “most”, and “few” provide
some of the most common examples of
quantification.[1]
In English, they combine with singular or plural nouns, sometimes
qualified by adjectives or relative clauses, to form explicitly
restricted quantifier phrases such as “some apples”,
“every material object”, or “most
planets”. These quantifier phrases may in turn combine with
predicates in order to form sentences such as “some apples are
delicious”, “every material object is extended”, or
“most planets are visible to the naked eye”. We may
conceive of determiners like “every” and
“some” as binary quantifiers of the form \(Q(A,B)\), which
may operate on two predicates, \(A\) and \(B\), in order to form a
sentence.
Binary quantifiers of this sort played an important role in what is
perhaps the first formal study of quantification developed by
Aristotle in the Prior Analytics. The details of Aristotle's
syllogistic logic are given in the entry
on Aristotle's Logic. Aristotle
investigated a restricted class of inferential patterns, which he
called syllogisms, in which two categorical propositions
served as premises and a third served as a conclusion. A categorical
proposition is a sentence obtained from one of the four binary
quantifiers “\(all(A, B)\)”, “\(some(A, B)\)”,
“\(no(A, B)\)” and “\(not \ all(A, B)\)”, when
suitable predicates are substituted for \(A\) and \(B\). In a 
syllogism, each categorical proposition contains two of three shared 
predicates. The logical
relations, which, according to Aristotelian logic, obtain between them
 are codified by
 the square of opposition.
 Although Aristotle's syllogistic logic dominated logic
for centuries, it eventually revealed itself inadequate for the
representation of mathematical argumentation, and it finally became
displaced by the advent of modern quantificational logic, which
originated with George Boole's algebraic approach to logic and Gottlob
Frege's approach to logic and quantification (1879).
Modern quantificational logic has chosen to focus instead on formal
counterparts of the unary quantifiers “everything” and
“something”, which may be written \(\forall x\) and \(\exists
x\), respectively. They are unary quantifiers because they require a
single argument in order to form a sentence of the form \(\forall x \
A\) or \(\exists x \ A\). Frege (and Russell) devised an ingenious
procedure for regimenting binary quantifiers like “every”
and “some” in terms of unary quantifiers like
“everything” and “something”: they 
formalized sentences of the form 
\(\ulcorner\)Some \(A\) is \(B\)\(\urcorner\) and
\(\ulcorner\)Every \(A\) is \(B\)\(\urcorner\) as \(\exists x (Ax \wedge Bx)\)
and \(\forall x (Ax \rightarrow Bx)\), respectively. They analyzed a
sentence like “some apples are delicious” in terms of the
sentence “something is an apple and delicious”, whereas
they parsed the sentence “every material object is
extended” as “everything is extended, if it is a material
object”. Unfortunately, this procedure cannot be generalized to cover quantifier phrases like
“many”, “most”, or “few”. It would
be a mistake to regiment the sentence “most planets are visible
to the naked eye” by means of “most things are planets and
visible to the naked eye” or “most things are such that
they are visible to the naked eye, if they are
planets”. Instead, they are better analyzed as irreducibly
binary quantifiers, and their study has given rise to the theory of
generalized quantifiers, which has become a fruitful subject of study
partly because of its applications in the semantics of natural
language.

Quantum Mechanics,0.9512990713119508,0.36590519547462463,"


Quantum mechanics is, at least at first glance and at least in part, a
mathematical machine for predicting the behaviors of microscopic
particles — or, at least, of the measuring instruments we use to
explore those behaviors — and in that capacity, it is spectacularly
successful: in terms of power and precision, head and shoulders above
any theory we have ever had. Mathematically, the theory is well
understood; we know what its parts are, how they are put together, and
why, in the mechanical sense (i.e., in a sense that can be answered by
describing the internal grinding of gear against gear), the whole thing
performs the way it does, how the information that gets fed in at one
end is converted into what comes out the other. The question of what
kind of a world it describes, however, is controversial; there is very
little agreement, among physicists and among philosophers, about what
the world is like according to quantum mechanics. Minimally
interpreted, the theory describes a set of facts about the way the
microscopic world impinges on the macroscopic one, how it affects our
measuring instruments, described in everyday language or the language
of classical mechanics. Disagreement centers on the question of what a
microscopic world, which affects our apparatuses in the prescribed
manner, is, or even could be, like intrinsically; or how those
apparatuses could themselves be built out of microscopic parts of the
sort the theory
 describes.[1]



That is what an interpretation of the theory would provide: a proper
account of what the world is like according to quantum mechanics,
intrinsically and from the bottom up. The problems with giving an
interpretation (not just a comforting, homey sort of interpretation,
i.e., not just an interpretation according to which the world isn't too
different from the familiar world of common sense, but any
interpretation at all) are dealt with in other sections of this
encyclopedia. Here, we are concerned only with the mathematical heart
of the theory, the theory in its capacity as a mathematical machine,
and — whatever is true of the rest of it — this part of the
theory makes exquisitely good sense.

Bohmian Mechanics,0.935518741607666,0.3438556790351868,"

Bohmian mechanics, which is also called the de Broglie-Bohm theory,
the pilot-wave model, and the causal interpretation of quantum
mechanics, is a version of quantum theory discovered by Louis de
Broglie in 1927 and rediscovered by David Bohm in 1952. It is the
simplest example of what is often called a hidden variables
interpretation of quantum mechanics. In Bohmian mechanics a system of
particles is described in part by its wave function, evolving, as
usual, according to Schrödinger’s equation. However, the
wave function provides only a partial description of the system. This
description is completed by the specification of the actual positions
of the particles. The latter evolve according to the
 “guiding equation”,
 which expresses the velocities of the particles in terms of the wave
function. Thus, in Bohmian mechanics the configuration of a system of
particles evolves via a deterministic motion choreographed by the wave
function. In particular, when a particle is sent into a two-slit
apparatus, the slit through which it passes and its location upon
arrival on the photographic plate are completely determined by its
initial position and wave function.

Bohmian mechanics inherits and makes explicit the nonlocality implicit
in the notion, common to just about all formulations and
interpretations of quantum theory, of a wave function on the
configuration space of a many-particle system. It accounts for all of
the phenomena governed by nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, from
spectral lines and scattering theory to superconductivity, the quantum
Hall effect and quantum computing. In particular, the usual
measurement postulates of quantum theory, including collapse of the
wave function and probabilities given by the absolute square of
probability amplitudes, emerge from an analysis of the two equations
of motion: Schrödinger’s equation and the guiding equation.
No invocation of a special, and somewhat obscure, status for
observation is required.

Collapse Theories,0.9287502765655518,0.3467549979686737,"

Quantum mechanics, with its revolutionary implications, has posed
innumerable problems to philosophers of science. In particular, it has
suggested reconsidering basic concepts such as the existence of a
world that is, at least to some extent, independent of the observer,
the possibility of getting reliable and objective knowledge about it,
and the possibility of taking (under appropriate circumstances)
certain properties to be objectively possessed by physical systems. It
has also raised many others questions which are well known to those
involved in the debate on the interpretation of this pillar of modern
science. One can argue that most of the problems are not only due to
the intrinsic revolutionary nature of the phenomena which have led to
the development of the theory. They are also related to the fact that,
in its standard formulation and interpretation, quantum mechanics is a
theory which is excellent (in fact it has met with a success
unprecedented in the history of science) in telling us everything
about what we observe, but it meets with serious difficulties
in telling us what is. We are making here specific reference
to the central problem of the theory, usually referred to as the
measurement problem, or, with a more appropriate term, as the
macro-objectification problem. It is just one of the many
attempts to overcome the difficulties posed by this problem that has
led to the development of Collapse Theories, i.e., to the
Dynamical Reduction Program (DRP). As we shall see, this
approach consists in accepting that the dynamical equation of the
standard theory should be modified by the addition of stochastic and
nonlinear terms. The nice fact is that the resulting theory is
capable, on the basis of a single dynamics which is assumed to govern
all natural processes, to account at the same time for all
well-established facts about microscopic systems as described by the
standard theory as well as for the so-called postulate of wave packet
reduction (WPR). As is well known, such a postulate is assumed in the
standard scheme just in order to guarantee that measurements have
outcomes but, as we shall discuss below, it meets with
insurmountable difficulties if one takes the measurement itself to be
a process governed by the linear laws of the theory. Finally, the
collapse theories account in a completely satisfactory way for the
classical behavior of macroscopic systems. 

Two specifications are necessary in order to make clear from the
beginning what are the limitations and the merits of the program. The
only satisfactory explicit models of this type (which are essentially
variations and refinements of the one proposed in 
Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber (1986), and usually referred to as
the GRW theory) are phenomenological attempts to solve a foundational
problem. At present, they involve phenomenological parameters which,
if the theory is taken seriously, acquire the status of new constants
of nature. Moreover, the problem of building satisfactory relativistic
generalizations of these models which seemed extremely difficult up to
few years ago, has seen some significant improvements. More important,
such improvements have elucidated some crucial points and have made
clear that there is no reason of principle preventing to reach this
goal.

In spite of their phenomenological character, we think that Collapse
Theories have a remarkable relevance, since they have made clear that
there are new ways to overcome the difficulties of the formalism, to
close the circle in the precise sense defined by Abner
Shimony (1989), which until a few years ago were considered
impracticable, and which, on the contrary, have been shown to be
perfectly viable. Moreover, they have allowed a clear identification
of the formal features which should characterize any unified theory of
micro and macro processes. Last but not least, Collapse theories
qualify themselves as rival theories of quantum mechanics and one can
easily identify some of their physical implications which, in
principle, would allow crucial tests discriminating between the two.
To get really stringent indications from such tests requires
experiments involving technological techniques which have been
developed only very recently. Actually, it is just due to remarkable
improvements in dealing with mesoscopic systems and to important
practical steps forward, that some specific bounds have already been
obtained for the parameters characterizing the theories under
investigation, and, more important, precise families of physical
processes in which a violation of the linear nature of the standard
formalism might emerge have been clearly identified and are the
subject of systematic investigations which might lead, in the end, to
relevant discoveries.

The Consistent Histories Approach to Quantum Mechanics,0.9397491812705994,0.3607760965824127,"
The consistent histories, also known as decoherent histories,
approach to quantum interpretation is broadly compatible with standard
quantum mechanics as found in textbooks. However, the concept
of measurement by which probabilities are introduced in
standard quantum theory no longer plays a fundamental
role. Instead, all quantum time dependence is probabilistic
(stochastic), with probabilities given by the Born rule or its
extensions. By requiring that the description of a quantum system be
carried out using a well-defined probabilistic sample space (called a
“framework”) this approach resolves all the well-known
quantum paradoxes of quantum foundations. In particular, quantum
mechanics is local and consistent with special relativity. Classical
mechanics emerges as a useful approximation to the more fundamental
quantum mechanics under suitable conditions. The price to be paid for
this is a set of rules for reasoning resembling, but also
significantly different from, those which comprise quantum logic. An
important philosophical implication is the lack of a single
universally-true state of affairs at each instant of time. However,
there is a correspondence limit in which the new quantum logic becomes
standard logic in the macroscopic world of everyday experience.
In the article that follows the term ‘consistent
histories’ will generally be abbreviated to
‘histories’, since the ‘decoherent’ and
‘consistent’ interpretations are very similar; when in
doubt insert ‘consistent’ before
‘histories’. The reader is assumed familiar with, and

successful theory in the history of science. It enables physicists,

metaphysical interpretation of quantum mechanics is to account for
these violations.

 The Copenhagen interpretation was the first general attempt to
understand the world of atoms as this is represented by quantum
mechanics. The founding father was mainly the Danish physicist Niels
Bohr, but also Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and other physicists made
important contributions to the overall understanding of the atomic
world that is associated with the name of the capital of Denmark.

 In fact Bohr and Heisenberg never totally agreed on how to understand
the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, and neither of them ever
used the term “the Copenhagen interpretation” as a joint
name for their ideas. In fact, Bohr once distanced himself from what
he considered to be Heisenberg's more subjective interpretation
(APHK, p.51). The term is rather a label introduced by people
opposing Bohr's idea of complementarity, to identify what they saw as
the common features behind the Bohr-Heisenberg interpretation as it
emerged in the late 1920s. Today the Copenhagen interpretation is
mostly regarded as synonymous with indeterminism, Bohr's
correspondence principle, Born's statistical interpretation of the
wave function, and Bohr's complementarity interpretation of certain
atomic phenomena.

get determinate measurement records that satisfy the standard quantum
statistics.  There has been considerable disagreement over the precise

the interaction, or the relation, between two systems.

The Role of Decoherence in Quantum Mechanics,0.948715090751648,0.3406243622303009,"


Interference phenomena are a well-known and crucial aspect of quantum
mechanics, famously exemplified by the two-slit experiment. There are
situations, however, in which interference effects are artificially or
spontaneously suppressed. The theory of decoherence is
precisely the study of (spontaneous) interactions between a system and
its environment that lead to such suppression of interference. We
shall make more precise what we mean by this in
 Section 1,
 which discusses the concept of suppression of interference and
gives a simplified survey of the theory, emphasising features that
will be relevant to the following discussion.  In fact, the term
decoherence refers to two largely overlapping areas of research.  The
characteristic feature of the first (often called
‘dynamical’ or ‘environmental’ decoherence) is
the study of concrete models of (spontaneous) interactions between a
system and its environment that lead to suppression of interference
effects. That of the second (the theory of ‘decoherent
histories’ or ‘consistent histories’) is an abstract
(and in fact more general) formalism that captures the essential
features of the phenomenon of decoherence. The two are obviously
closely related, and will both be reviewed in turn
in Section 1.


Decoherence is relevant (or is claimed to be relevant) to a variety of
questions ranging from the measurement problem to the arrow of time,
and in particular to the question of whether and how the
‘classical world’ may emerge from quantum mechanics. This
entry mainly deals with the role of decoherence in relation to the
main problems and approaches in the foundations of quantum
mechanics. Specifically,
 Section 2
 analyses the claim that decoherence solves the
 measurement problem. It also
discusses the exacerbation of the problem through the inclusion of
environmental interactions, the idea of emergence of classicality, and
the motivation for discussing decoherence together with approaches to
the foundations of quantum mechanics.
 Section 3
 then reviews the relation of decoherence to some of the main
foundational approaches.  Finally, in
 Section 4
 we mention suggested applications that would push the role of
decoherence even further.


Suppression of interference has of course featured in many papers
since the beginning of quantum mechanics, such as Mott's (1929)
analysis of alpha-particle tracks. The modern foundation of
decoherence as a subject in its own right was laid by H. D. Zeh in the
early 1970s (Zeh 1970; 1973). Equally influential were the papers by
W. Zurek from the early 1980s (Zurek 1981; 1982). Some of these
earlier examples of decoherence (e.g., suppression of interference
between left-handed and right-handed states of a molecule) are
mathematically more accessible than more recent ones. A concise and
readable introduction to the theory is provided by Zurek
in Physics Today (1991). (This article was followed by
publication of several letters with Zurek's replies (1993),
which highlight controversial issues.) More recent surveys are the
ones by Zeh (1995), which devotes much space to the interpretation of
decoherence, Zurek (2003), and the books on decoherence by Giulini
et al. (1996) and Schlosshauer
 (2007).[1]

Quantum theory is fundamental to contemporary
 physics.[1]
It is natural to view a fundamental physical theory as describing or
representing the physical world. But many physicists and some
philosophers have questioned or rejected this view of quantum theory.
They have viewed the theory as concerned with our observation and
description of, knowledge or beliefs about, or interactions with the
world. Views of this kind have been expressed since the 1920s when
quantum theory emerged in close to its present form. This entry is
concerned with more recent developments of this tradition by
physicists and philosophers, much of it described as quantum Bayesian
or pragmatist. This entry discusses quantum Bayesianism in section 1,

The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Argument in Quantum Theory,0.9348220229148864,0.32407668232917786,"

In the May 15, 1935 issue of Physical Review Albert Einstein
co-authored a paper with his two postdoctoral research associates at
the Institute for Advanced Study, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen. The
article was entitled “Can Quantum Mechanical Description of
Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?” (Einstein et
al. 1935). Generally referred to as “EPR”, this paper
quickly became a centerpiece in debates over the interpretation of
quantum theory, debates that continue today. Ranked by impact, EPR is
among the top ten of all papers ever published in Physical
Review journals. Due to its role in the development of quantum
information theory, it is also near the top in their list of currently
“hot“ papers. The paper features a striking case where two
quantum systems interact in such a way as to link both their spatial
coordinates in a certain direction and also their linear momenta (in
the same direction), even when the systems are widely separated in
space. As a result of this “entanglement”, determining
either position or momentum for one system would fix (respectively)
the position or the momentum of the other. EPR prove a general lemma
connecting such strict correlations between spatially separated
systems to the possession of definite values. On that basis they argue
that one cannot maintain both an intuitive condition of local action
and the completeness of the quantum description by means of the wave
function. This entry describes the lemma and argument of that 1935
paper, considers several different versions and reactions, and
explores the ongoing significance of the issues raised.

Identity and Individuality in Quantum Theory,0.9232030510902404,0.3615779876708984,"


What are the metaphysical implications of quantum physics? One way of
approaching this question is to consider the impact of the theory on
our understanding of objects as individuals with well defined identity
conditions. According to the ‘Received View’, which was
elaborated as the quantum revolution was taking place, quantum theory
implies that the fundamental particles of physics cannot be regarded
as individual objects in this sense. Such a view has motivated the
development of non-standard formal systems which are appropriate for
representing non-individual objects. However, it has also been argued
that quantum physics is in fact compatible with a metaphysics of
individual objects, but that such objects are indistinguishable in a
sense which leads to the violation of Leibniz’s famous Principle of
the Identity of Indiscernibles. This last claim has recently been
contested in a way that has reinvigorated the debate over the impact
of the theory. As a result, we are faced with a form of
underdetermination of the relevant metaphysics by the physics, in
which we have, on the one hand, quantum objects-as-individuals and, on
the other, quantum objects-as-non-individuals. It has been argued that
this underdetermination of such fundamental metaphysical ‘packages’
has important implications for the realism-antirealism debate.

Quantum Computing,0.9334666728973388,0.3719456195831299,"

 Combining physics, mathematics and computer science, quantum
computing has developed in the past two decades from a visionary idea
to one of the most fascinating areas of quantum mechanics. The recent
excitement in this lively and speculative domain of research was
triggered by Peter Shor (1994) who showed how a quantum algorithm
could exponentially “speed-up” classical computation and factor large
numbers into primes much more rapidly (at least in terms of the number
of computational steps involved) than any known classical
algorithm. Shor’s algorithm was soon followed by several other
algorithms that aimed to solve combinatorial and algebraic problems,
and in the last few years theoretical study of quantum systems serving
as computational devices has achieved tremendous progress. Common
belief has it that the implementation of Shor’s algorithm on a large
scale quantum computer would have devastating consequences for current
cryptography protocols which rely on the premise that all known
classical worst-case algorithms for factoring take time
exponential in the length of their input (see, e.g., Preskill
2005). Consequently, experimentalists around the world are engaged in
tremendous attempts to tackle the technological difficulties that
await the realization of such a large scale quantum computer. But
regardless whether these technological problems can be overcome (Unruh
1995, Ekert and Jozsa 1996, Haroche and Raimond 1996), it is
noteworthy that no proof exists yet for the general
superiority of quantum computers over their classical counterparts.


 The philosophical interest in quantum computing is threefold: First,
from a social-historical perspective, quantum computing is a domain
where experimentalists find themselves ahead of their fellow
theorists. Indeed, quantum mysteries such as
 entanglement
and
 nonlocality
 were historically considered a philosophical quibble, until
physicists discovered that these mysteries might be harnessed to
devise new efficient algorithms. But while the technology for
isolating 5 or even 7 qubits (the basic unit of information in the
quantum computer) is now within reach (Schrader et al. 2004,
Knill et al. 2000), only a handful of quantum algorithms
exist, and the question whether these can solve classically
intractable computational problems is still open. Next, from a more
philosophical perspective, advances in quantum computing may yield
foundational benefits. It may turn out that the technological
capabilities that allow us to isolate quantum systems by shielding
them from the effects of
 decoherence
 for a period of time long enough to manipulate them will also allow
us to make progress in some fundamental problems in the foundations of
quantum theory itself. Indeed, the development and the implementation
of efficient quantum algorithms may help us understand better the
border between classical and quantum physics, hence elucidate an
important problem, namely, the measurement problem, that so far resists a
solution. Finally, the idea that abstract mathematical concepts such
as complexity and (in)tractability may not only be
translated into physics, but also re-written by physics bears
directly on the autonomous character of computer science and the
status of its theoretical entities—the so-called “computational
kinds”. As such it is also relevant to the long-standing philosophical
debate on the relationship between mathematics and the physical
world.

Quantum Gravity,0.9168981313705444,0.3669219017028809,"


Quantum Gravity, broadly construed, is a physical theory (still
‘under construction’) incorporating both the principles of
general relativity and quantum theory. Such a theory is expected to be
able to provide a satisfactory description of the microstructure of
spacetime at the so-called Planck scale, at which
all fundamental constants of the ingredient theories, c (the
velocity of light in vacuo), ℏ (the reduced Planck's constant),
and G (Newton's constant), come together to form units of mass,
length, and time. This scale is so remote from current experimental
capabilities that the empirical testing of quantum gravity proposals
along standard lines is rendered near-impossible.

In most, though not all, theories of quantum gravity, the
gravitational field itself is also quantized. Since the contemporary
theory of gravity, general relativity, describes gravitation as the
curvature of spacetime by matter and energy, a quantization of gravity
seemingly implies some sort of quantization of spacetime geometry:
quantum spacetime. Insofar as all extant physical theories rely on a
classical (non-quantum) spacetime background, this presents not only
extreme technical difficulties, but also profound methodological and
ontological challenges for the philosopher and the physicist. Though
quantum gravity has been the subject of investigation by physicists
for almost a century, philosophers have only just begun to investigate
its philosophical implications.

Quantum Logic and Probability Theory,0.867741048336029,0.860091507434845,"

Mathematically, quantum mechanics can be regarded as a non-classical
probability calculus resting upon a non-classical propositional logic.
More specifically, in quantum mechanics each probability-bearing
proposition of the form “the value of physical quantity \(A\)
lies in the range \(B\)” is represented by a projection operator
on a Hilbert space \(\mathbf{H}\). These form a non-Boolean—in
particular, non-distributive—orthocomplemented lattice.
Quantum-mechanical states correspond exactly to probability measures
(suitably defined) on this lattice.

What are we to make of this? Some have argued that the empirical
success of quantum mechanics calls for a revolution in logic itself.
This view is associated with the demand for a realistic interpretation
of quantum mechanics, i.e., one not grounded in any primitive notion
of measurement. Against this, there is a long tradition of
interpreting quantum mechanics operationally, that is, as being
precisely a theory of measurement. On this latter view, it is not
surprising that a “logic” of measurement-outcomes, in a
setting where not all measurements are compatible, should prove not to
be Boolean. Rather, the mystery is why it should have the
particular non-Boolean structure that it does in quantum
mechanics. A substantial literature has grown up around the programme
of giving some independent motivation for this
structure—ideally, by deriving it from more primitive and
plausible axioms governing a generalized probability theory.

The Uncertainty Principle,0.9345126748085022,0.31327909231185913,"

Quantum mechanics is generally regarded as the physical theory that is
our best candidate for a fundamental and universal description of the
physical world. The conceptual framework employed by this theory
differs drastically from that of classical physics. Indeed, the
transition from classical to quantum physics marks a genuine
revolution in our understanding of the physical world.

One striking aspect of the difference between classical and quantum
physics is that whereas classical mechanics presupposes that exact
simultaneous values can be assigned to all physical quantities,
quantum mechanics denies this possibility, the prime example being the
position and momentum of a particle. According to quantum mechanics,
the more precisely the position (momentum) of a particle is given, the
less precisely can one say what its momentum (position) is. This is (a
simplistic and preliminary formulation of) the quantum mechanical
uncertainty principle for position and momentum. The uncertainty
principle played an important role in many discussions on the
philosophical implications of quantum mechanics, in particular in
discussions on the consistency of the so-called Copenhagen
interpretation, the interpretation endorsed by the founding fathers
Heisenberg and Bohr.

This should not suggest that the uncertainty principle is the only
aspect of the conceptual difference between classical and quantum
physics: the implications of quantum mechanics for notions as
(non)-locality, entanglement and identity play no less havoc with
classical intuitions.

(weakly) stratified. This last condition requires that there should be
a function \(\sigma\) (a “stratification”) from
the bound variables in \(\Phi\) to an initial segment
of the natural numbers such that if ‘\(u \in v\)’ is a
subformula of \(\Phi\) then \(\sigma(`v\rsquo) = \sigma(`u\rsquo) +
1\) and if \(`u = v\rsquo\) is a subformula of \(\Phi\) then
\(\sigma(`v\rsquo) = \sigma(`u\rsquo)\). The origins of this
constraint will be explained below.


Some illustrations may help: \(x \in x\) is not stratified. \(x \in
y\) is. Thus not every substitution-instance of a stratified formula
is stratified.  \(y = \wp(x)\) is stratified (the fancy P means power
set), with the variable \(y\) being given a type one higher than the
type given to \(x\). To check this we have to write out ‘\(y =
\wp(x)\)’ in primitive notation. (In primitive notation, this
formula becomes: \(\forall z(z \in y \leftrightarrow \forall w(w \in z
\leftrightarrow z \in x))\). One can assign 0 to \(w, 1\) to \(z\),
and 2 to \(x\), to get a stratification of this formula.) In general
it is always necessary to write a formula out in primitive
notation – at least until one gets the hang of it.


The observant reader will have spotted the appearance above of the
expression weakly stratified. What is this? The instance of
the comprehension that says that \(x \cup \{y\}\) always exists is
stratified, and is therefore an axiom. So \(x \cup \{y\}\) always
exists. So \(x \cup \{x\}\) always exists, by substitution. However
the instance of the comprehension scheme alleging its existence is not
stratified. The term ‘\(x \cup \{x\}\)’ is said to
be weakly stratified by which it is meant that it can be
stratified if we are allowed to give different types to distinct
occurrences of
free variables. Weak stratification is what is needed to
admit ab initio those instances of the comprehension scheme
that give us substitution instances of stratified instances, and not
require a detour such as the detour here through the
existence of \(x \cup \{y\}\).

Quotation,0.8324742317199707,0.6338519454002379,"


Starting with Frege, the semantics (and pragmatics) of quotation has
received a steady flow of attention over the last one hundred
years. It has not, however, been subject to the same kind of intense
debate and scrutiny as, for example, both the semantics of definite
descriptions and propositional attitude verbs. Many
philosophers probably share Davidson's experience: ‘When I was
initiated into the mysteries of logic and semantics, quotation was
usually introduced as a somewhat shady device, and the introduction
was accompanied by a stern sermon on the sin of confusing the use and
mention of expressions’ (Davidson 1979, p. 79). Those who leave
it at that, however, miss out on one of the most difficult and
interesting topics in the philosophy of language.


Quotation interests philosophers and linguists for various reasons,
including these:

When language is used to attribute properties to language or
otherwise theorize about it, a linguistic device is needed that
‘turns language on itself’. Quotation is one such device.
It is our primary meta-linguistic tool. If you don't understand
quotation, then you can't understand sentences like
 (1)–(4)[1]

‘Snow is white’ is true in English iff snow is white.
‘Aristotle’ refers to Aristotle.
‘The’ is the definite article in English.
‘bachelor’ has eight letters.





Those who are in the business of theorizing about language are
particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms that render
(1)–(4) intelligible.

Theories of quotation address questions not just about
how quotations refer, but also about what they refer
to. In this regard, theories of quotation tell us what we are talking
about in (1)–(4).
Quotation is a paradigmatic opaque context, i.e. a context in
which substitution of synonymous or co-referential expressions can fail
to preserve truth-value. To understand the nature of opacity you must
understand how quotation functions.
Quotation is a device for talking about language, but it does so
in a particularly tricky way: somehow quotation manages to use its
referent to do (or at least to participate in) the referring; the
referent of “Aristotle” is part of
“Aristotle”. As such, it is a particularly interesting
referential device.
As with all issues in the philosophy of language, theories of
quotation harbor assumptions about how best to draw the distinction
between semantics and pragmatics, and they do so in a particularly
illuminating way.
Theories of quotation raise a range of important questions about
how indexicals should be interpreted and about the nature of context
sensitivity.



More generally, quotation presents semanticists with a particularly
challenging range of puzzles. Those interested in such puzzles tend to
find the study of quotation intrinsically interesting.

Race,0.478115051984787,0.7868571281433105,"


The concept of race has historically signified the division of
humanity into a small number of groups based upon five criteria: (1)
Races reflect some type of biological foundation, be it Aristotelian
essences or modern genes; (2) This biological foundation generates
discrete racial groupings, such that all and only all members of one
race share a set of biological characteristics that are not shared by
members of other races; (3) This biological foundation is inherited
from generation to generation, allowing observers to identify an
individual’s race through her ancestry or genealogy; (4)
Genealogical investigation should identify each race’s geographic
origin, typically in Africa, Europe, Asia, or North and South America;
and (5) This inherited racial biological foundation manifests itself
primarily in physical phenotypes, such as skin color, eye shape, hair
texture, and bone structure, and perhaps also behavioral phenotypes,
such as intelligence or delinquency.


This historical concept of race has faced substantial scientific and
philosophical challenge, with some important thinkers denying both the
logical coherence of the concept and the very existence of races.
Others defend the concept of race, albeit with substantial changes to
the foundations of racial identity, which they depict as either
socially constructed or, if biologically grounded, neither discrete nor
essentialist, as the historical concept would have it.


Both in the past and today, determining the boundaries of discrete
races has proven to be most vexing and has led to great variations in
the number of human races believed to be in existence. Thus, some
thinkers categorized humans into only four distinct races (typically
white or Caucasian, black or African, yellow or Asian, and red or
Native American), and downplayed any biological or phenotypical
distinctions within racial groups (such as those between Scandavians
and Spaniards within the white or Caucasian race). Other thinkers
classified humans into many more racial categories, for instance
arguing that those humans “indigenous” to Europe could be
distinguished into discrete Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean
races.


The ambiguities and confusion associated with determining the
boundaries of racial categories have over time provoked a widespread
scholarly consensus that discrete or essentialist races are
socially constructed, not biologically real. However, significant
scholarly debate persists regarding whether reproductive isolation,
either during human evolution or through modern practices barring
miscegenation, may have generated sufficient genetic isolation as to
justify using the term race to signify the existence of non-discrete
human groups that share not only physical phenotypes but also clusters
of genetic material. In addition, scholarly debate exists concerning
the formation and character of socially constructed, discrete racial
categories. For instance, some scholars suggest that race is
inconceivable without racialized social hierarchies, while others argue
that egalitarian race relations are possible. Finally, substantial
controversy surrounds the moral status of racial identity and
solidarity and the justice and legitimacy of policies or institutions
aimed at undermining racial inequality.


This entry focuses on contemporary scholarship regarding the
conceptual, ontological, epistemological, and normative questions
pertaining to race. Apart from an introductory section on the history
of the concept of race in the West and in Western philosophy, it does
not focus on authors such as Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, or
Frantz Fanon, or movements, such as Negritude, Critical Race Theory,
Black Identity, Philosophy of Liberation, or Feminist Perspectives on
Race. Interested readers should consult the relevant entries in the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for insight into these and other
topics important to the study of race in philosophy. 

In Section II, I will trace the historical origins and development of
the concept of race. Section III covers contemporary philosophical
debates over whether races actually exist. Thereafter, in section IV I
will examine the differences between race and ethnicity. Finally, in
Section V I will survey debates among moral, political and legal
philosophers over the validity of racial identity, racial solidarity,
and race-specific policies such as affirmative action and race-based
representation.

Radulphus Brito († 1320/21) was an important thirteenth-century
master of arts at the University of Paris. He was part of the group of
medieval masters who later came to be known as the modistae,
principally because of their common appeal to the notion of modes of
signifying (modi significandi) in their accounts of
grammatical congruence. Brito’s philosophical work is largely
unexplored, even though it is a crucial link between the philosophical
discussions of the thirteenth and the fourteenth centuries. Among
other things, he richly contributed to the development of medieval
logic and philosophy of language. In fact, one can fairly consider his
logic of intentions to be the pinnacle of the development of
thirteenth-century Aristotelian logic. Brito was a prolific author,
who commented on nearly all the Aristotelian corpus. Almost his entire
philosophical work is extant, although most of it is unedited.

Petrus Ramus,0.6715341210365295,0.12491615861654284,"

While Petrus Ramus (1515–1572) undoubtedly occupies an important
place in the history of ideas, few nowadays would consider him to be
one of the most significant philosophers of his time. Yet in his day
he gained an impressive number of followers and admirers, and his
works influenced the curriculum of many European universities.
According to scholars such as Walter J. Ong, Ramus’ frequently
reprinted books on logic “could in no real sense be considered
an advance or even a reform” (Ong 1958: 5). Yet, it was mainly
on the basis of these books that he acquired an impressive reputation
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries

We must look at Ramus as a typical phenomenon of the sixteenth century
and its unceasing religious controversies. It was also a period of
state building, during which Italian humanism was transformed into its
Northern European counterpart. Ramus himself took part in this
process. A Huguenot convert from Catholicism, he was one of the most
famous victims of the St. Bartholomew’s day massacre. From early
youth he fought against scholasticism and its interpretation of
Aristotle; and he tried to reform the contemporary university
curriculum in a way that would fulfill the new needs of the emerging
states. As a good humanist, he approached everything linguistically
and rhetorically.

The extent to which he was, in reality, an offspring of the scholastic
tradition has yet to be recognized. Although he attracted many ardent
supporters, his scholastic anti-scholasticism was the main reason why
his revolt against traditional philosophy did not produce an entirely
new philosophical system. Ramus soon came to be considered, not an
innovative thinker, but an outmoded one.

To gain a true picture of Petrus Ramus and his work, it is necessary
to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the enthusiasm of his
admirers and hagiographical biographers and, on the other, the
scholars who, from a positivistic or a scholastic perspective, have
criticized his lack of originality and consistency. It is impossible
to describe Ramus’ thinking and to understand his importance
without considering both sides of the story. He may never have
intended to achieve what posterity has blamed him for not achieving.
Instead modern historians have emphasized the huge impact his
pedagogical ideas had for almost a century.

Ayn Rand,0.503858745098114,0.5516952872276306,"

Ayn Rand (1905–1982) was a novelist-philosopher who outlined a
comprehensive philosophy, including an epistemology and a theory of
art, in her novels and essays. Early in her career she also wrote
short stories, plays, and screenplays. Rand’s first and most
autobiographical novel, We the Living (1936), set in the
Soviet Union, was published only after many rejections, owing to
widespread sympathy for the Soviet “experiment” among the
intellectuals of the day. We the Living was quickly followed
by the dystopian novel, Anthem (1938), written as “a
kind of rest” from work on her next major novel, The
Fountainhead (1943). The Fountainhead, also published
after many rejections because of its individualism, and largely panned
by critics, soon became a best-seller by word of mouth. The
Fountainhead brought Rand international fame, and Atlas
Shrugged (1957) sealed this fame. By 1958, Rand’s novels,
increasingly philosophical, had won her ideas a sufficiently devoted
following for her to form, in association with psychologist Nathaniel
Branden (with whom she later broke), an official
“Objectivist” philosophical movement, complete with
journals and lecture courses. For all her popularity, however, only a
few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a
result, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in
non-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the
bibliography reflects this fact. We discuss the main reasons for her
rejection by most professional philosophers in the first section. Our
discussion of Rand’s philosophical views, especially her
moral-political views, draws from both her non-fiction and her
fiction, since her views cannot be accurately interpreted or evaluated
without doing so.

Historicist Theories of Scientific Rationality,0.8928555846214294,0.518804669380188,"

[Editor's Note: The following new entry by Thomas Nickles replaces the
 former entry
 on this topic by the previous authors.]


Many scientists, philosophers, and laypersons have regarded science as
the one human enterprise that successfully escapes the contingencies
of history to establish eternal truths about the universe, via a
special, rational method of inquiry. Historicists oppose this view. In
the 1960s several historically informed philosophers of science
challenged the then-dominant accounts of scientific method advanced by
the Popperians and the positivists (the logical positivists and
logical empiricists) for failing to fit historical scientific practice
and failing particularly to account for deep scientific change. While
several strands of historicism originated in nineteenth-century
historiography, this article focuses, first, on the historicist
conceptions of scientific rationality that became prominent in the
1960s and 1970s, as the maturation of the field of historiography of
science began to suggest competing models of scientific development,
and, second, on recent approaches such as historical epistemology.

The “Battle of the Big Systems” of the 1960s and
‘70s, involving historicists such as Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos,
Paul Feyerabend, and Larry Laudan, eventually gave way to a realist
reaction, as many philosophers rejected the perceived skepticism and
potential relativism of the historicist movement, now reinforced by
new-wave sociology of science. The 1990s featured the so-called
Science Wars, as philosophers attempted to defend truth, rationality,
objectivity, and scientific progress (and their own turf) from the
perceived threats of rapidly developing, sociology-inspired science
and technology studies and (other) postmodern influences. Since then,
a group of interdisciplinary scholars have attempted to reimagine ways
in which historical and philosophical work can be brought together
fruitfully.

Realism,0.8391714692115784,0.6078272461891174,"


The question of the nature and plausibility of realism arises with
respect to a large number of subject matters, including ethics,
aesthetics, causation, modality, science, mathematics, semantics, and
the everyday world of macroscopic material objects and their
properties. Although it would be possible to accept (or reject)
realism across the board, it is more common for philosophers to be
selectively realist or non-realist about various topics: thus it would
be perfectly possible to be a realist about the everyday world of
macroscopic objects and their properties, but a non-realist about
aesthetic and moral value. In addition, it is misleading to think that
there is a straightforward and clear-cut choice between being a
realist and a non-realist about a particular subject matter. It is
rather the case that one can be more-or-less realist about a
particular subject matter. Also, there are many different forms that
realism and non-realism can take. 


 The question of the nature and plausibility of realism is so
controversial that no brief account of it will satisfy all those with
a stake in the debates between realists and non-realists. This article
offers a broad brush characterisation of realism, and then fills out
some of the detail by looking at a few canonical examples of
opposition to realism. The discussion of forms of opposition to
realism is far from exhaustive and is designed only to illustrate a
few paradigm examples of the form such opposition can take.


 There are two general aspects to realism, illustrated by looking at
realism about the everyday world of macroscopic objects and their
properties. First, there is a claim about existence. Tables,
rocks, the moon, and so on, all exist, as do the following facts: the
table's being square, the rock's being made of granite, and the moon's
being spherical and yellow. The second aspect of realism about the
everyday world of macroscopic objects and their properties concerns
independence. The fact that the moon exists and is spherical
is independent of anything anyone happens to say or think about the
matter. Likewise, although there is a clear sense in which the table's
being square is dependent on us (it was designed and constructed by
human beings after all), this is not the type of dependence that the
realist wishes to deny. The realist wishes to claim that apart from
the mundane sort of empirical dependence of objects and their
properties familiar to us from everyday life, there is no
further (philosophically interesting) sense in which everyday
objects and their properties can be said to be dependent on anyone's
linguistic practices, conceptual schemes, or whatever.


 In general, where the distinctive objects of a subject-matter are
a, b, c, … , and the distinctive
properties are F-ness, G-ness,
H-ness and so on, realism about that subject matter
will typically take the form of a claim like the following:

Generic Realism: 
a, b, and c and so on exist, and the fact
that they exist and have properties such as F-ness,
G-ness, and H-ness is (apart from mundane empirical
dependencies of the sort sometimes encountered in everyday life)
independent of anyone's beliefs, linguistic practices, conceptual
schemes, and so on.
 


 Non-realism can take many forms, depending on whether or not it is
the existence or independence dimension of realism that is questioned
or rejected. The forms of non-realism can vary dramatically from
subject-matter to subject-matter, but error-theories, non-cognitivism,
instrumentalism, nominalism, certain styles of reductionism, and
eliminativism typically reject realism by rejecting the existence
dimension, while idealism, subjectivism, and anti-realism typically
concede the existence dimension but reject the independence dimension.
Philosophers who subscribe to quietism deny that there can be such a
thing as substantial metaphysical debate between realists and their
non-realist opponents (because they either deny that there are
substantial questions about existence or deny that there are
substantial questions about independence).

Challenges to Metaphysical Realism,0.8401530981063843,0.6130672693252563,"

According to metaphysical realism, the world is as it is independently
of how humans or other inquiring agents take it to be. The objects the
world contains, together with their properties and the relations they
enter into, fix the world’s nature and these objects exist
independently of our ability to discover they do. Unless this is so,
metaphysical realists argue, none of our beliefs about our world could
be objectively true since true beliefs tell us how things are and
beliefs are objective when true or false independently of what anyone
might think.

Many philosophers believe metaphysical realism is just plain common
sense. Others believe it to be a direct implication of modern science,
which paints humans as fallible creatures adrift in an inhospitable
world not of their making. Nonetheless, metaphysical realism is
controversial. Besides the analytic question of what it means to
assert that objects exist independently of the mind, metaphysical
realism also raises epistemological problems: how can we obtain
knowledge of a mind-independent world? There are also prior semantic
problems, such as how links are set up between our beliefs and the
mind-independent states of affairs they allegedly represent. This is
the Representation Problem.

Anti-realists deny the world is mind-independent. Believing the
epistemological and semantic problems to be insoluble, they conclude
realism must be false. In this entry I review a number of semantic and
epistemological challenges to realism all based on the Representation
Problem:

The Manifestation Argument: the cognitive and linguistic behaviour
of an agent provides no evidence that realist mind/world links
exist;
The Language Acquisition Argument: if such links were to exist
language learning would be impossible;
The Brain-in-a-Vat Argument: realism entails both that we could be
massively deluded (‘brains in a vat’) and that if we were
we could not even form the belief that we were;
The Conceptual Relativity Argument: it is senseless to ask what
the world contains independently of how we conceive of it, since the
objects that exist depend on the conceptual scheme used to classify
them;
The Model-Theoretic Argument: realists must either hold that an
ideal theory passing every conceivable test could be false or that
perfectly determinate terms like ‘cat’ are massively
indeterminate, and both alternatives are absurd.


I proceed by first defining metaphysical realism, illustrating its
distinctive mind-independence claim with some examples and
distinguishing it from other doctrines with which it is often
confused, in particular factualism. I then outline the Representation
Problem in the course of presenting the anti-realist challenges to
metaphysical realism that are based on it. I discuss metaphysical
realist responses to these challenges, indicating how the debates have
proceeded, suggesting various alternatives and countenancing
anti-realist replies.

The aim throughout will be to see whether the realist can respond to
the anti-realist challenges and so much of the subsequent discussion
will be taken up with attempts to formulate realist replies to these
challenges that have some initial credibility. However it needs to be
noted that all these replies are provisional: anti-realism gains much
of its force by highlighting a gap between realist metaphysics and
epistemology that no one really knows how to bridge.

Debates about scientific realism are closely connected to almost
everything else in the philosophy of science, for they concern the
very nature of scientific knowledge. Scientific realism is a positive
epistemic attitude toward the content of our best theories and models,
recommending belief in both observable and unobservable aspects of the
world described by the sciences. This epistemic attitude has important
metaphysical and semantic dimensions, and these various commitments
are contested by a number of rival epistemologies of science, known

Realism and Theory Change in Science,0.8774952292442322,0.5595582723617554,"

Scientific theories seem to have an expiry date. If we look at the
history of science, a number of theories that once were dominant and
widely accepted are currently taught in history of science courses.
Will this be the fate of current scientific theories? Is there a
pattern of radical theory-change as science grows? Are theories
abandoned en bloc? Or are there patterns of retention in
theory-change? That is, are some parts of theories more likely to
survive than other parts? And what are the implications of all this
for the scientific image of the world?

These kinds of question have played a major role in the scientific
realism debate. The challenge to scientific realism is supposed to
come directly from the history of science. The history of science, it
is claimed, is at odds with scientific realism’s epistemic
optimism. It is full of theories which were shown to be false and
abandoned, despite their empirical successes. Hence, it is claimed,
realists cannot be warrantedly optimistic about the (approximate)
truth of currently empirically successful theories. If we take the
historical evidence seriously, it is claimed, current theories too
will, sooner or later, be abandoned and take their place in future
history-of-science courses. This anti-realist line of argument has
become known as ‘the pessimistic induction’ (aka
pessimistic meta-induction)—henceforth PI. Without
denying that theories change over time, scientific realists have tried
to block this line of argument by showing that there is substantive
continuity in theory-change which warrants the realist’s
optimism that current science is on the right track.

This entry discusses the origin and current state of the historical
challenge to realism and the various realist reactions to it. The
first part focuses on the first enactment of arguments based on
historical pessimism, as these appeared in the so-called
‘bankruptcy of science controversy’ in the end of the
nineteenth century.

The second part deals with the historical challenge to scientific
realism as this is currently formulated and the various lines of
defense of the claim that scientific knowledge grows despite
theory-change.

"Reasons for Action: Justification, Motivation, Explanation",0.5505155324935913,0.7670120000839233,"

Why are you always lying? Why did the Ancient Egyptians mummify their
dead? Should Huck Finn have turned Jim in? Why is she selling her car?
Questions that ask for reasons, and in particular, reasons for action,
are among the commonest questions humans have. Philosophers have
sought to understand the nature of such reasons. Most contemporary
philosophers start by distinguishing two types of reason for action:
“normative” reasons—that is, reasons which, very
roughly, favour or justify an action, as judged by a well-informed,
impartial observer; and “motivating” reasons—which,
again roughly, are reasons the “agent” (that is, the
person acting) takes to favour and justify her action and that guides
her in acting. But there are, in addition, “explanatory”
reasons, reasons that explain an action without necessarily justifying
it and without being the reasons that motivated the agent.

A clear understanding of reasons for action in their justifying,
motivating and explanatory functions is of relevance to the philosophy
of action, to ethics, political philosophy and the philosophy of law.
The essential issues about reasons—what they are, and how they
relate to human actions—are of wider concern.

This entry examines the various accounts that philosophers have given
of these different kinds of reasons and their interconnections, as
well as the disagreements among them about these matters. The focus
will be on reasons for acting—what are commonly called
“practical reasons”, leaving aside questions that are
specific to other reasons, for instance, reasons for believing,

Recognition,0.5069247484207153,0.7187075614929199,"


Recognition has both a normative and a psychological dimension. Arguably, if you recognize another person with regard to a certain feature, as
an autonomous agent, for example, you do not only admit that she has
this feature but you embrace a positive attitude towards her for having
this feature. Such recognition implies that you bear obligations
to treat her in a certain way, that is, you recognize a specific
normative status of the other person, e.g., as a free and equal person.
But recognition does not only matter normatively. It is also of
psychological importance. Most theories of recognition assume that in
order to develop a practical identity, persons fundamentally depend on
the feedback of other subjects (and of society as a whole). According
to this view, those who fail to experience adequate recognition, i.e.,
those who are depicted by the surrounding others or the societal norms
and values in a one-sided or negative way, will find it much harder to
embrace themselves and their projects as valuable. Misrecognition
thereby hinders or destroys persons' successful relationship to
their selves. It has been poignantly described how the victims of
racism and colonialism have suffered severe psychological harm by being
demeaned as inferior humans (Fanon 1952). Thus, recognition constitutes
a “vital human need” (Taylor 1992, 26).


Recognition theory is thought to be especially well-equipped to
illuminate the psychological mechanisms of social and political
resistance. As experiences of misrecognition violate the identity of
subjects, the affected are supposed to be particularly motivated to
resist, that is, to engage in a “struggle for recognition.”
Therefore, at least since the 1990s, theories of recognition have
enjoyed a lively academic as well as public interest. They promise to
illuminate a variety of new social movements—be it the
struggles of ethnic or religious minorities, of gays and lesbians or of
people with disabilities. None of these groups primarily fight for a
more favorable distribution of goods. Rather, they struggle for an
affirmation of their particular identity and are thus thought
to be engaged in a new form of politics, sometimes labeled
“politics of difference” or “identity
politics.” However, many accounts want to ascribe a much more
fundamental role to the concept of recognition—covering the
morality of human relationships in its entirety. From this more general
perspective, also earlier campaigns for equal rights—be it by
workers, women or African Americans—should be understood as
“struggles for recognition.” To frame these political
movements in terms of recognition highlights the relational character
of morality—and justice: Justice is not primarily concerned
with how many goods a person should have but rather with what kind of
standing vis-à-vis other persons she deserves (Young 1990).


This entry will first discuss some controversies surrounding the
very concept of recognition (1) before reviewing four dimensions of
what is recognized (by whom and on what
grounds) that have been highlighted by different theories of
recognition (2). However, even in light of these differentiations some
authors have expressed the fear that concentrating on the issue of
recognition might supplant the central problem of (re)distribution on
the political agenda (3). Finally, the often rather sanguine
descriptions of recognition and its potential for emancipation (4)
have been fundamentally challenged: The concern is that because the
need for recognition renders persons utterly dependent on the
dominating societal norms it may undermine the identity of any critic. Thus, some worry that struggles for recognition may lead to
conformism and a strengthening of ideological formations (5).

Reconciliation,0.3721674978733063,0.683417022228241,"


Among the things commonly described as reconciled are ideas,
narratives, persons, groups, and God. To reconcile theories with one
another is to render them mutually consistent. To reconcile yourself to
the fact that you have cancer is to live better with the belief that
you do. Reconciliation of the divine-human relationship is linked in
the Christian tradition to the notion of salvation. This essay
concentrates on the uses to which the concept of reconciliation has
been put in the treatment of moral and political issues that arise in
the aftermath of wrongdoing and conflict between persons and
groups.

The term ‘reconciliation’ is used to refer either to a
process or to an outcome or goal. Reconciliation, as an outcome, is an
improvement in the relations among parties formerly at odds with one
another. The nature and degree of improvement required to qualify as
reconciliation for any particular context is a matter of disagreement
among theorists. So too, the reasons why relations have improved may
play a role in determining whether reconciliation has genuinely taken
place. That is, on some accounts, two parties will count as reconciled
only if their better future relations result from their having
satisfactorily dealt with the emotional, epistemic, and/or material
legacy of the past. While the outcome of reconciliation is oriented
toward a future marked by peaceful and just relations, the processes
of reconciliation are typically oriented towards the continuing bad
feelings, suspicions, or harms that were created by the conflicts and
injustices of the past.

Philosophical interest in reconciliation as a moral and political
value grew in the 1990s in response to its invocation during South
Africa’s dramatic transition from apartheid to democracy
(National Unity and Reconciliation Act, No. 34 of 1995; South
African Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report 1998).
The South African case, as well as the difficult issues left in the
wake of other civil conflicts of the era, including the genocide in
Rwanda and the wars in the former Yugoslavia, led political and legal
thinkers to define the topic of transitional justice (see the entry
on 
 transitional justice). The 
question of transitional justice is: how can
post-conflict societies justly make the transition to stable and (it is
usually stipulated) democratic government given the reality of past
wrongs and harms (Minow 1998, Teitel 2002)? Of overriding importance is
establishing the conditions that will ensure that such abuses happen
“Never Again.” In South Africa in the 1990s,
‘reconciliation’ seemed to be of crucial importance to a
just transition. It was in the name of this value that the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) offered amnesty from prosecution to
those guilty of politically motivated human rights abuses in return for
their full and truthful testimony. Theorists and political analysts
debate the extent to which the TRC contributed to reconciliation in
South Africa, as well as whether its Commissioners properly conceived
of reconciliation (Tutu 1999, Rotberg and Thompson 2000, Gibson 2004,
Hamber 2009, Allais 2012).

Increasingly, political theorists and philosophers discuss the value
of reconciliation in other political and legal contexts. For example,
one now sees the language and theories of reconciliation, which were
originally developed to deal with transitional contexts, applied as
well to stable, non-transitional democracies. Discussions of how
well-established states such as the United States, Canada, or Australia
deal with their own historical legacies of injustice are frequently
posed as questions about the reconciliation of groups that continue to
live in relationship with one another rather than as the more solitary
problem of “coming to terms with the past” (Thompson 2002,
Brooks 2004, Barkan and Karn 2006, Kymlicka and Bashir 2010). The value
of reconciliation is also sometimes appealed to within discussions of
criminal law, especially among those who are interested in
investigating alternative sentencing procedures and sanctions.
“Restorative justice” advocates conceptualize crime as a
problem in the relationship among the offender, the victim, and the
local community, and look to measures such as restitution payments and
face-to-face dialogue in order to restore that relationship
(Braithwaite 2000, van Ness and Strong 2002). Whether civil law, too,
is amenable to interpretations that emphasize broken and repaired
relationships is an open question (Radzik 2014). Meierhenrich (2008)
notes connections between the value of reconciliation and practices in
civil law traditions of “conciliation,” where the emphasis
is on the accommodation of competing claims

Finally, reconciliation has emerged as a topic among moral theorists
who discuss the ethical issues that arise in the aftermath of everyday
forms of wrongdoing, such as transgressions within friendships or
family relationships (Walker 2006, Griswold 2007, Radzik 2009). Much of
this discussion takes place in the literature on forgiveness (see the
entry on 
  forgiveness). Here, theorists ask 
whether one may reconcile with a
wrongdoer without also forgiving him, or forgive a person without
reconciling. Such questions arise as well in the literature on
reconciliation in political and legal contexts, where there are often
strong objections to forgiving the wrongdoers (who may, after all,
remain unrepentant for committing atrocities) or to placing other
people under pressure to forgive them. For some, a conception of
reconciliation that does not require forgiveness offers a positive way
forward in these difficult cases (e.g., Eisikovits 2009, Verdeja 2009,
C. Murphy 2010).

Discussion of the value of reconciliation, especially in political
contexts, often has a skeptical orientation. Dictators and war-makers
pay lip-service to the value of reconciliation while aggression
continues. Such appeals reinforce skepticism about the value of
reconciliation. Reconciliation is claimed to put unjustifiable demands
on victims of wrongdoing and to sacrifice justice for peace (Rotberg
and Thompson 2000). Other critics charge that the language of
reconciliation lends itself to misuse because it is essentially empty.
Given that the concept has no widely recognized, determinate content or
clear normative standards, almost anyone can claim to be pursuing
reconciliation (Schaap 2008). As this essay will indicate, defenders of
the concept of reconciliation do believe that it is amenable to further
articulation. However, while the concept of reconciliation is not
empty, it defies easy or definitive analysis.

This entry treats the topic of reconciliation in a manner that
respects its significance across moral (viz. interpersonal and
private), legal and political contexts. Many of the issues and debates
that arise in the literature on reconciliation are relevant to each of
these contexts. However, issues that are specific to political
contexts, where the philosophical literature on reconciliation is most
extensive, will receive special attention.

Particular conceptions of reconciliation vary across a number of
dimensions. As section 1 explains, the kind of relationship at issue in
a specific context affects the type of improvement in relations that
might be necessary in order to qualify as reconciliation.
Reconciliation is widely taken to be a scalar concept. Section 2
discusses the spectrum of intensity along which kinds of improvement in
relationships fall, and indicates why, in particular contexts,
theorists often disagree about the point along this spectrum that is
morally or politically most significant. Section 3 provides an overview
of the processes commonly cited as contributing to reconciliation.
These processes are often controversial; those praised by some
commentators as appropriate and constructive responses to past conflict
are dismissed by others as undermining the moral or political
conditions for just and peaceful relations. Section 4 concentrates on
the relationship between reconciliation and justice. While some see
these values as compatible and mutually supporting, others argue that,
especially in the immediate wake of conflict, parties must often choose between
reconciliation and justice.

Scientific Reduction,0.9246039986610411,0.4953653514385224,"


The English verb ‘reduce’, derives from the Latin
‘reducere’, whose literal meaning ‘to bring
back’, informs its metaphorical use in philosophy. If one asserts
that the mental reduces to the physical, that heat reduces to kinetic
molecular energy, or that one theory reduces to another theory, one
implies that in some relevant sense the reduced theory can be
brought back to the reducing theory, the mental can be
brought back to the physical, or heat can be brought
back to molecular kinetic energy. The term
‘reduction’ as used in philosophy expresses the idea that
if an entity x reduces to an entity y then y is
in a sense prior to x, is more basic
than x, is such that x fully depends upon
it or is constituted by it. Saying that x reduces
to y typically implies that x is nothing more
than y or nothing over and above y.


Though the term ‘reduction’ in this use may not
correspond to everyday use nor to scientific discourse, its technical
meaning is not fixed by mere stipulation. ‘Reduction’ is a
term of natural language, and, building upon its common metaphoric
meaning philosophers use it to designate relations of particular
philosophical importance in a number of closely related fields,
especially in the philosophy of science, the philosophy of mind, and
metaphysics.


The notion of scientific reduction as used in contemporary
analytic philosophy differs from conceptions of reduction according to
which we learn about the instantiation of reduction-relations on a
purely a priori basis from basic religious, metaphysical or
epistemological principles. ‘Scientific reduction’
applies to reductionist claims supposedly justified by scientific
evidence and the success of science.


Different accounts of scientific reduction have shaped debates about
diverse topics including scientific unification, the relation between
(folk-)psychology and neuroscience, the 
metaphysics of the mind, the status of biology vis à vis
chemistry, and the relation between allegedly teleological
explanations and causal explanations.  Understanding the relevant
notions is thus a prerequisite for understanding key issues in
contemporary analytic philosophy. Moreover, the notion of reduction
itself has become a target of recent philosophical discussion,
especially in the philosophy of science and in metaphysics.

Reflective Equilibrium,0.4710767865180969,0.6952248215675354,"

Many of us, perhaps all of us, have examined our moral judgments about
a particular issue by looking for their coherence with our beliefs
about similar cases and our beliefs about a broader range of moral and
factual issues. In this everyday practice, we have sought
“reflective equilibrium” among these various beliefs as a
way of clarifying for ourselves just what we ought to do. In addition,
we may also have been persuading ourselves that our conclusions were
justifiable and ultimately acceptable to us by seeking coherence among
them. Even though it is part of our everyday practice, is this
approach to deliberating about what is right and finding justification
for our views defensible?

Viewed most generally, a “reflective equilibrium” is the
end-point of a deliberative process in which we reflect on and revise
our beliefs about an area of inquiry, moral or non-moral. The inquiry
might be as specific as the moral question, “What is the right
thing to do in this case?” or the logical question, “Is
this the correct inference to make?” Alternatively, the inquiry
might be much more general, asking which theory or account of justice
or right action we should accept, or which principles of inductive
reasoning we should use. We can also refer to the process or method
itself as the “method of reflective equilibrium.”

The method of reflective equilibrium can be carried out by individuals
acting separately or together. In the latter case, the method is
dialogical and agreement among participants may or may not be
accompanied by a search for coherence. We shall be focused on the
method when it seeks coherence among beliefs, for an avowal of
agreement may well not include a real coherence of beliefs.

In what follows, we first give an overview of the method of reflective
equilibrium and comment briefly on its history. We then discuss in
more detail the evolution of the method and its role in the work of
John Rawls. Against that background, we then remark on some of the
controversy surrounding the claim that coherence among our moral or
our logical beliefs in reflective equilibrium counts as a
justification for them, including the challenge to including moral
intuitions or facts about the world in such a justification. Finally,
we discuss some implications the method has for work in ethics.

Henricus Regius (in Dutch: Hendrik de Roy) may be recognised today
primarily as one of Descartes' correspondents. However, he was also
the author of a textbook of natural philosophy, Fundamenta
physices (1646), which offered a significant alternative to Cartesian
epistemology and metaphysics. His correspondence with Descartes, and
his simultaneous controversy with G.  Voetius during the 1640s,

August Wilhelm Rehberg,0.6122936010360718,0.4648303687572479,"

 Though little known in the Anglophone world, and largely forgotten
even in the Germanic world, August Wilhelm Rehberg (1757-1836) was a
pivotal thinker in the era of classical German philosophy from Kant to
Hegel.  No thinker from that fertile period has been more unjustly
neglected.  He wrote some acute and highly-regarded reviews of Kant,
and he corresponded with Kant about the philosophy of
 mathematics.[1]
 Kant's reply to Rehberg's objections is one
of his most important explanations of his mathematical
 doctrines.[2]
 Such, indeed, was Rehberg's grasp of Kant that
J.B. Jachmann, Kant's friend and biographer, regarded him as
“the finest head among all your
 students.”[3]
 But Rehberg was much more than a Kantian epigone.  He also made an
original contribution to the pantheism controversy, where he staked
out his own position vis-à-vis Jacobi, Mendelssohn,
Herder and Kant; and he wrote an influential critique of Reinhold's
Elementarphilosophie, which was a potent source of the
skepticism surrounding neo-Kantian foundationalism in the early 1790s.
All these facts are sufficient to give Rehberg a notable, if minor,
place in the intellectual pantheon of his age.  They are not, however,
the main reason for remembering him.  

 Rehberg's historical importance lies chiefly in his critique of the
French Revolution.  In the early 1790s he became renowned as its
foremost conservative critic.  He was the chief spokesman for the
so-called ‘Hannoverian Whigs’, a group of conservative
writers based in Göttingen who defended the old
Ständesstaat (i.e., a state based on the old society
of estates) against revolutionary
 ideology.[4]
 Rehberg provided the philosophical foundations for the politics of the
Hannoverians, and he saw more clearly than they, or any other
conservative writer of his day, the general philosophical issues
raised by the Revolution.  The basis for his attack on revolutionary
ideology was his skeptical epistemology, which grew out of his study
of Hume and Kant.  For all these reasons, Rehberg has been rightly
regarded as a founding father of German
 conservatism.[5]

Hans Reichenbach,0.9458555579185486,0.4192741513252258,"

Described as perhaps “the greatest empiricist of the 20th
century” (Salmon, 1977a), the work of Hans Reichenbach
(1891–1953) provides one of the main statements of empiricist
philosophy in the 20th century. Provoked by the conflict between
(neo-) Kantian a priorism and Einstein's relativity of space and time,
Reichenbach developed a scientifically inspired philosophy and an
uncompromisingly empiricist epistemology. He was literate in the
physical science of his time, and acquainted with many of its most
eminent practitioners. Criticism and justification of scientific
methodology formed the core of almost all his philosophical efforts,
which he promoted in a crescendo of books, in the journal
Erkenntnis, which he founded and edited with Rudolf Carnap,
and within a group of philosophers, mathematicians and scientists he
led in Berlin. His commitment to objectivity and realism in science
together with his probabilistic justification of belief in scientific
results carried philosophical and technical difficulties that shaped
much of the subsequent debate in philosophy of science. Reichenbach's
contributions cover large swathes of formal philosophy, especially in
philosophy of physics, logic, induction and the foundations of
probability, and his later work encompassed linguistics, philosophical
logic, and ethics. The fruits of some of his insights are only
belatedly having their full impact. For example, several of the recent
accounts of causality employ ideas that can be traced to Reichenbach's
The Direction of Time. 

Partitioning the work of a philosopher with views about almost
everything is indispensable in a retrospective, but in Reichenbach's
case separation is especially artificial. From 1915 until 1953, most
of his philosophical essays entangle issues and doctrines about
probability, causality, physics, epistemology and metaphysics.
Reichenbach's ideas about causality and probability are so intertwined
that it makes little sense to discuss them separately. Unavoidably,
therefore, different aspects of the same works are discussed in
several sections of the following essay. Reichenbach's views on all of
these topics changed so radically over time that there is no one
“Reichenbach system,” and we therefore offer a synoptic
history of his views within each topic. All of our citations are from
the English editions of his publications, where available.

Thomas Reid,0.575511634349823,0.4029568135738373,"


Thomas Reid (1710–1796) is a Scottish philosopher best known for his
philosophical method, his theory of perception and its wide
implications on epistemology, and as the developer and defender of an
agent-causal theory of free will. In these and other areas he offers
perceptive and important criticisms of the philosophy of Locke,
Berkeley and especially Hume. He is also well known for his criticisms
of Locke's view of personal identity and Hume's view of
causation. Reid also made influential contributions to philosophical
topics including ethics, aesthetics and the philosophy of mind. The
legacy of Thomas Reid's philosophical work is found in contemporary
theories of perception, free will, philosophy of religion, and widely
in epistemology.

After studying at the University of Aberdeen, Reid entered the
ministry in New Machar in 1737. In 1748 he published a short essay
entitled “An Essay on Quantity” concerning
Hutcheson's Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of Beauty and
Virtue. Although this was his only published work, he was given a
professorship at King's College Aberdeen in 1752. There he
published An Inquiry Into the Human Mind on the Principles of
Common Sense (or ‘IHM’) in 1764. Later he received a prestigious
professorship at the University of Glasgow. He resigned from this
position in 1781 in order to give himself more time to write, and
published Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (or ‘EIP’)
in 1785 and Essays on the Active Powers of Man (or ‘EAP’) in
1788. These three books, along with four additional books composed of
papers, essays and more, have been recently republished in the
Edinburgh Edition of Thomas Reid.

In the Inquiry, a methodologically pioneering work due to its
extensive and rigorous use of observational data to justify claims
about perception, Reid examines each of the five senses and discusses
the ways in which we achieve knowledge of the world by employing
them. Intellectual Powers expands his system beyond the
apprehension of the world through the senses to consideration of
memory, imagination, knowledge, the nature of judgment, reasoning and
taste. The Active Powers examines a collection of topics
concerning ethics, the nature of agency generally, and the distinctive
features of human agency.

Reid's Ethics,0.5749569535255432,0.40321576595306396,"

We are often told that the moral theories defended by modern
philosophers fall into two types. On the one hand are rationalist
positions developed by thinkers such as Samuel Clarke, William
Wollaston, and Richard Price. The rationalists, it is said, believe
that reason is the basis of morality, as morality is (in some sense)
both grounded in and grasped by reason. On the other hand are
sentimentalist positions championed by philosophers such as the Third
Earl of Shaftesbury, Francis Hutcheson, and David Hume. The
sentimentalists, it is claimed, hold that affect is the basis of
morality. According to the standard classification, the
sentimentalists believe that morality has relatively little to do with
reason, as it is (in some sense) both grounded in and discerned by
sentiment.

Thomas Reid’s (1710–1796) moral philosophy does not neatly
fit into this scheme of classification. To be sure, some characterize
Reid as a rationalist working within the tradition of Clarke and Price
(see MacIntyre 1966 and Rawls 2000, Introduction). One can see why.
Reid, after all, affirms core rationalist claims, such as that there
is a body of necessary moral principles that are self-evident to the
ordinary person. But there are important elements of Reid’s
thought that do not fit the rationalist paradigm. For example, Reid
defends the view that all normal, mature human beings are endowed with
a moral sense. Like philosophers such as Hutcheson and Hume, Reid
claims that the moral sense yields sentiments of various sorts that
themselves occasion “our first moral conceptions,” such as
the apprehension that an act is approbation-worthy (EAP V.ii: 279).
This account of concept formation, according to some philosophers,
would make Reid’s position a version of sentimentalism (see
D’Arms 2005). In this respect, Reid’s position resembles
not Clarke’s and Price’s but Hutcheson’s and
Hume’s.

There is, then, a sense in which Reid’s moral philosophy resists
ready categorization. It is neither a version of rationalism nor
sentimentalism, but an attempt to blend those features from both these
traditions that Reid found most attractive. This presents a challenge
to the contemporary interpreter of Reid’s moral philosophy. One
wonders: Is Reid’s theory of morals an exotic hybrid, one which
eludes the categories used by contemporary philosophers to describe
ethical theories?

Not exactly. Anyone familiar with contemporary moral philosophy could
not fail to miss the resemblance that Reid’s position bears to
the view defended some one hundred and fifty years later by W. D. Ross
(see Ross 2002). Although Ross never mentions Reid as an influence,
both thinkers operate within a broadly non-naturalist framework
according to which the sciences offer us limited insight into the
nature of moral reality. In so doing, they both stood against powerful
trends in their day to “naturalize” ethics. Moreover, both
reject monistic accounts of the moral domain, such as those defended
by Kantians and consequentialists, according to which there is one
master ethical principle from which all others are derived. According
to both Reid and Ross, there is instead a plurality of self-evident
moral first principles, none of which is reducible to another.

In light of this, we might describe Reid’s position as a
proto-Rossian version of ethical intuitionism. While such a
description is tempting, it would probably be misleading. For the
parallels between Reid and Ross extend only so far. The most important
difference between the two thinkers is this: Ross frames his project
in the light of G. E. Moore’s Open Question Argument and
Mill’s utilitarianism—two philosophical topics about which
Reid knew nothing. Reid, by contrast, developed his version of ethical
intuitionism within the context of a defense of a certain account of
human agency, according to which each of us is endowed with
“active power” which we can freely exercise. Reid believed
that this account of human agency, when coupled with our best
scientific knowledge, yields a form of non-naturalist ethical
intuitionism. Call a position that grounds many of its core
metaethical claims about the nature of moral reality in a particular
view of human agency an agency-centered account.
Agency-centered views tell us that in order to understand the nature
of moral reality we must first examine the nature of agency.
Reid’s is an agency-centered version of ethical intuitionism.
Ross’s, by contrast, is not.

The project of this essay is to present both the motivations for and
fundamental contours of Reid’s agency-centered intuitionist
view. Before diving into the details of Reid’s position,
however, it may be worth saying a word about the influence of
Reid’s views in contemporary ethics. If one were to gauge this
influence by the number of books or articles written in the last one
hundred years about Reid’s ethics, one would have to conclude
that his influence is negligible. Very little has been written about
Reid’s moral philosophy. Indeed, Reid is not even included in
what is perhaps the standard anthology on the British Moralists, the
two-volume work edited by Selby-Bigge of the same title (Selby-Bigge
1965). Moreover, one would also have to conclude that Reid’s
influence on moral philosophers who receive a great deal of attention,
such as Moore, is marginal. For example, in the flurry of work
produced in 2003 on the centenary of the publication of Moore’s
Principia Ethica, no one mentions Reid as an influence on
Moore’s ethical views.

The reality of the matter, however, is that Reid has indeed exercised
considerable influence on contemporary moral philosophy, albeit
indirectly. This influence runs primarily through Henry Sidgwick, who
knew Reid’s work well (see Sidgwick 2000, Ch. 16). Sidgwick, it
seems, exposed his student, G. E. Moore, to Reid’s views (see
Beanblossom 1983). Reid’s broadly common sense methodology and
his positive views were subsequently taken up by Moore. Among the more
salient similarities one finds in their ethical views is that both
thinkers are interested in whether the fundamental moral properties
are definable. Reid claims they are not; fundamental moral properties
are, in Reid’s estimation, simple, indefinable, and sui generis
(EAP III.iii.v). Famously, Moore said the same, although for somewhat
different reasons. And the rest, as they say, is history. Depending on
one’s views, one might view this history as one in which Moore
finally put ethical theory on the right track or, alternatively,
pushed it off the rails. Whatever one’s opinion on this issue,
Reid seems to have had a role in its direction.

Reid on Memory and Personal Identity,0.7002535462379456,0.3944782316684723,"


Thomas Reid held a direct realist theory of memory. Like his direct
realism about perception, Reid developed his account as an alternative
to the model of the mind that he called ‘the theory of
ideas.’ On such a theory, mental operations such as perception
and memory have mental states—ideas or impressions—as
their direct objects. These mental states are understood as
representations that encode information about their causes. The mind
is directed towards and reads off from these representations,
information about extra-mental items. By contrast, Reid holds that the
direct objects of memory and perception are extra-mental. In the case
of perception, the mind is directed to present material objects and
properties; in the case of memory, the mind is directed towards past
events to which the person was agent or witness. In other words,
according to Reid, when we remember, we do not recall previous
experiences. In memory, the mind is directed neither towards an idea
experienced previously nor towards an idea of a previous
experience. Rather, we recall events, experienced
previously.


Reid is interested in the notion of memory not only for its own sake
but also because of its conceptual connection to the notion of personal
identity. Reid criticizes Locke's theory of personal
identity for inferring a metaphysical hypothesis now called the Memory
Theory from the conceptual connection between memory and personal
identity. On this theory, personal identity consists in
memory; sameness of memory is metaphysically necessary and sufficient
for sameness of persons. According to Reid, memory is neither necessary
nor sufficient for personal identity, metaphysically speaking.
Indeed, Reid holds that it is impossible to account for personal
identity in any terms other than itself. Personal identity is
simple and unanalyzable. Though memory is not the metaphysical ground
of personal identity, according to Reid, it provides first-personal
evidence of personal identity. I know that I was present at my
graduation because I remember being there. Memories do not
make one the same person over time. Rather, memories
allow one to know one's own past, immediately and directly.

Adolf Reinach,0.6984676718711853,0.4874567985534668,"


Adolf Reinach was a leading representative of the so-called realist
tradition within phenomenology who has been described as
Husserl's “first real co-worker in the development of the
phenomenological movement” (Willard 1969, p. 194). Although his
life was tragically cut short, and his corpus of writings modest in
size, Reinach's essays on general ontology, on the philosophy of
law and on the philosophy of language, are remarkably clear and
original examples of the phenomenological approach to philosophizing.
His principal distinction lies in his 1913 monograph “On the
A Priori Foundations of the Civil Law”, whose analysis
of the act of promising anticipates several crucial aspects of the
speech act theories of Austin and Searle.

Karl Leonhard Reinhold (1757–1823), Austrian philosopher and first
occupant of the chair on Critical Philosophy established at the
University of Jena in 1787, first achieved fame as a proponent of
popular Enlightenment and as an early and effective popularizer of the
Kantian philosophy. During his period at the University of Jena
(1787–94), Reinhold proclaimed the need for a more
“scientific” and systematic presentation of the Critical
philosophy, one based upon a single, self-evident first principle. In
an effort to satisfy this need, he expounded his own “Elementary
Philosophy” in a series of influential works between 1789 and
1791. Though Reinhold’s Elementary Philosophy was much criticized, his
call for a more coherent and systematic exposition of transcendental
idealism exercised a profound influence upon the subsequent development
of post-Kantian idealism and spurred others (such as J. G. Fichte) to
seek a philosophical first principle even more
“fundamental” than Reinhold’s own “Principle of
Consciousness.” After moving to the University of Kiel, Reinhold
became an adherent, first of Fichte’s Wissenschaftslehre and
then of C. G. Bardili’s “rational realism,” before finally
proposing a novel “linguistic” approach to philosophical
problems.

Reism,0.8320702314376831,0.7261933088302612,"


Reism is the doctrine that only things exist. The name is derived from
the Latin noun res (‘thing’). The interpretation
of this very rough view depends on how things are understood. Reism
was anticipated by many nominalists (that is, philosophers maintaining
that only individuals exist) and materialists, particularly by the
Stoics, medieval doctrines of singualaria
(particulars) or Hobbes’ considerations on corpora
(bodies). Some tenets of reism are to be found in
Leibniz. Brentano defended reism very strongly in
his later philosophy, when he argued against entia rationis
(objects of thought; he meant by this objects which exist in thought
alone). Brentano became a reist in about 1904 and attracted to this
position some of his younger followers (so-called younger
Brentanists), like O. Kraus, A. Kastil and G. Katkov. The most
developed version of reism can be credited to Tadeusz Kotarbiński
(1886–1981), a Polish philosopher and one of the leading members of
the Lvov-Warsaw School. He introduced the term
‘reism’ to denote the philosophical view that the category
of things is the sole ontological category. In other words, reism
reduces all categories to that of things. Yet reists differ in their
views about what exactly is included in the category of things. For
example, if one takes the Aristotelian table of categories (ten
rubrics: substance, relation, etc.) the reist would say that
substances interpreted as things are the only existents. Reism also
has a semantic dimension, for it recommends that only singular names, that
is, names referring to concrete things, should be used, and
abstract words avoided. Eventually, one can use sentences with
abstract words provided that they have translations into statements
with singular terms.

Relations,0.7506183385848999,0.58806312084198,"

The world we inhabit isn’t an undifferentiated bog. Everywhere
there’s repetition and, importantly, we can even distinguish
different types of repetition. We see one cat and then
another cat. But we can also see that our cat is on top
of the mat and subsequently notice that the cat from next door is
on top of the fence. Repetition in the first sense requires
only one thing and then another. By contrast, repetition in the second
sense requires two (or more) things and then two (or more) other
things. Properties are typically introduced to account for repetition
in the first sense, whereas relations are typically introduced to
account for repetition in the second sense. There’s cat
repetition because there is more than one thing that has a certain
property, the property of being a cat. There’s above-and-below
repetition because there is more than one thing that bears a certain
relation to something else, the relation that holds between two things
when one is on top of the other.

It’s doubtful whether the distinction between properties and
relations can be given in terms that do not ultimately presuppose
it—the distinction is so basic. Nevertheless, there are
elucidations on offer that may help us better appreciate the
distinction. Properties merely hold of the things that have
them, whereas relations aren’t relations of anything,
but hold between things, or, alternatively, relations are
borne by one thing to other things, or, another
alternative paraphrase, relations have a subject of inherence
whose relations they are and termini to which they
relate the subject. More examples may help too. When we say that a
thing A is black, or A is long, then we are asserting
that there is some property A has. But when we say that
A is (wholly) inside B then we are asserting that there
is a relation in which A stands to B.

Be careful though not to be misled by these examples. A can
only be (wholly) inside B if A is distinct from
B. So the relation in which A stands to B if
A is (wholly) inside B requires a distinct subject from
terminus. By contrast, A can be black without prejudice to
anything else. But we cannot infer straightaway that every relation
holds between more than one thing because there may be some relations
that a thing bears to itself, if, for example, identity is a relation.
So we cannot distinguish properties from relations by appealing to the
number of distinct things required for their exhibition, since these
may be the same, viz. one. Hence the plausibility of thinking that a
relation differs from a property because a relation, unlike a
property, proceeds from a subject to a terminus,
even if the subject and terminus are identical.

Theories of relations add to, subtract from or qualify this basic
package of ideas in various ways. But with the distinction between
properties and relations in hand we can already do some worthwhile
conceptual geography, distinguishing four regions of logical space.
(1) Rejection of both properties and relations. (2) Acceptance of
properties but rejection of relations. (3) Acceptance of relations but
rejection of properties. (4) Acceptance of both properties and
relations. (1) amounts to a form of thoroughgoing nominalism and is
typically motivated by a blanket aversion to the doctrine that general
words like “black” or “before” refer to
worldly items, whether properties or relations. By contrast, (2), (3)
and (4) amount to different forms of realism, whether about properties
and/or relations. Typically they are motivated either by an especial
antipathy toward relations (2) or, alternatively, an appreciation
of their distinctive utility ((3) and (4)). Here we will focus upon
what it is about relations in particular that makes philosophers
either love them or hate them.

Relativism,0.5589593648910522,0.6917262673377991,"
Relativism, roughly put, is the view that truth and falsity, right
and wrong, standards of reasoning, and procedures of justification are
products of differing conventions and frameworks of assessment and
that their authority is confined to the context giving rise to them.
More precisely, “relativism” covers views which maintain
that—at a high level of abstraction—at least some class of
things have the properties they have (e.g., beautiful, morally good,
epistemically justified) not simpliciter, but only relative
to a given framework of assessment (e.g., local cultural norms,
individual standards), and correspondingly, that the truth of claims
attributing these properties holds only once the relevant framework of
assessment is specified or supplied. Relativists characteristically
insist, furthermore, that if something is only relatively so,
then there can be no framework-independent vantage point from which
the matter of whether the thing in question is so can be
established.
Relativism has been, in its various guises, both one of the most
popular and most reviled philosophical doctrines of our
time. Defenders see it as a harbinger of tolerance and the only
ethical and epistemic stance worthy of the open-minded and
tolerant. Detractors dismiss it for its alleged incoherence and
uncritical intellectual permissiveness.  Debates about relativism
permeate the whole spectrum of philosophical sub-disciplines. From
ethics to epistemology, science to religion, political theory to
ontology, theories of meaning and even logic, philosophy has felt the
need to respond to this heady and seemingly subversive
idea. Discussions of relativism often also invoke considerations
relevant to the very nature and methodology of philosophy and to the
division between the so-called “analytic and continental”
camps in philosophy. And yet, despite a long history of debate going
back to Plato and an increasingly large body of writing, it is still
difficult to come to an agreed definition of what, at its core,
relativism is, and what philosophical import it has. This entry
attempts to provide a broad account of the many ways in which
“relativism” has been defined, explained, defended and
criticized.

The Epistemology of Religion,0.7117928266525269,0.7840230464935303,"


Contemporary epistemology of religion may conveniently be treated as a
debate over whether evidentialism applies to religious beliefs, or whether we should instead
adopt a more permissive epistemology. Here evidentialism is the
initially plausible position that a belief is justified only if
“it is proportioned to the evidence”. For example, suppose
a local weather forecaster has noticed that over the two hundred years
since records began a wetter than average Winter is followed in 85% of
cases by a hotter than average Summer. Then, assuming for simplicity
that the records are reliable, the forecaster is justified in  believing
with less than full confidence that this Winter, which is wetter than
average, will be followed by a hotter than average Summer. But
evidentialism implies that it would not be justified to have full
belief, that is belief with 100% confidence. Again, consider someone
who has a hunch that this Summer will be hotter than average
but cannot justify that hunch further. Hunches are not considered
evidence, so the belief is not considered justified. If, however, the
huncher can cite a good track record of hunches about the weather that
have turned out correct then the belief would be considered
justified. For although hunches are not considered evidence, memories
about past hunches are, as are the observations that corroborated the
past hunches.
 Evidentialism implies that full religious belief is justified only
if there is conclusive evidence for it. It follows that if the
arguments for there being a God, including any arguments from
religious experience, are at best probable ones, no one would be
justified in having a full belief that there is a God. And the same
holds for other religious beliefs, such as the belief that God is not
just good in a utilitarian fashion but loving, or the belief that
there is an afterlife.  Likewise it would be unjustified to believe
even with less than full confidence that, say, Krishna is divine or
that Mohammed is the last and most authoritative of the prophets,
unless a good case can be made for these claims from the evidence.
 Evidentialism, then, sets rather high standards for justification,
standards that the majority do not, it would seem, meet when it comes
to religious beliefs, where many rely on “faith”, which is
more like the forecaster’s hunch about the weather than the argument
from past climate records. Many others take some body of scripture,
such as the Bible or the Koran as of special authority, contrary to
the evidentialist treatment of these as just like any other
books making various claims.  Are these standards too high?
 This century has seen a turn in the debate, with emphasis on the
implications of disagreement, “How can sincere intelligent
people disagree? Should not we all suspend judgement?”

Religion and Morality,0.5367257595062256,0.5804980993270874,"


From the beginning of the Abrahamic faiths and of Greek philosophy,
religion and morality have been closely intertwined. This is true
whether we go back within Greek philosophy or within Christianity and
Judaism and Islam. The present entry will not try to step beyond these
confines, since there are other entries on Eastern thought (see, for 
example, the entries on
 Ethics in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism
and
 Chinese Ethics).
 The entry
proceeds chronologically, giving greatest length to the contemporary
period.  It cannot, within the present compass, aspire to be
comprehensive.  But it will be able to describe the main
options as they have occurred historically.  The purpose of proceeding
historically is to substantiate the claim that morality and religion
have been inseparable until very recently, and that our moral
vocabulary is still deeply infused with this history. Since there are
historically so many different ways to see the relation, a purely
schematic or typological account is not likely to succeed as well.
The entry will not try to enter deeply into the ethical theories of
the individual philosophers mentioned, since this encyclopedia already
contains individual entries about them; it will focus on what they say
about the relation between morality and religion. 


The term ‘morality’ as used in this entry will not be
distinguished from ‘ethics.’ Philosophers have drawn
various contrasts between the two at various times (Kant for example,
and Hegel, and more recently R.M. Hare and Bernard Williams). But
etymologically, the term ‘moral’ comes from the
Latin mos, which means custom or habit, and it is a
translation of the Greek ethos, which means roughly the same
thing, and is the origin of the term ‘ethics’. In
contemporary non-technical use, the two terms are more or less
interchangeable, though ‘ethics’ has slightly more flavor
of theory, and has been associated with the prescribed practice of
various professions (e.g., medical ethics, etc.). In any case, this
entry will assume that morality is a set of customs and habits that
shape how we think about how we should live or about what is a good
human life. The term ‘religion’ is much disputed. Again,
we can learn from the etymology. The origin of the word is probably
the Latin
religare, to bind back. Not all uses of the term require
reference to a divinity or divinities. But this entry will use the
term so that there is such a reference, and a religion is a system of
belief and practice that accepting a ‘binding’ relation to
such a being or beings. This does not, however, give us a single
essence of religion, since the conceptions of divinity are so various,
and human relations with divinity are conceived so variously that no
such essence is apparent even within Western thought. The ancient
Greeks, for example, had many intermediate categories between full
gods or goddesses and human beings. There were spirits (in Greek
daimones) and spiritual beings like Socrates's mysterious
voice (daimonion) (Apology, 31d1–4, 40a2–c3). There
were heroes who were offspring of one divine and one human
parent. There were humans who were deified, like the kings of
Sparta. This is just within the culture of ancient Greece. If we
included Eastern religions in the scope of the discussion, the hope
for finding a single essence of religion would recede
further. Probably it is best to understand ‘religion’ as a term for a
group of belief/practice amalgams with a family resemblance to each
other, but no set of necessary and sufficient conditions tying them
together (see Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations,
65–7).

conducive to science, or do they inevitably pose obstacles to

Natural Theology and Natural Religion,0.7107405662536621,0.5481600165367126,"
The term “natural religion” is sometimes taken to refer
to a pantheistic doctrine according to which nature itself is
divine. “Natural theology”, by contrast, originally
referred to (and still sometimes refers 
 to)[1]
the project of arguing for the existence of God on the basis of
observed natural facts. 
In contemporary philosophy, however, both “natural
religion” and “natural theology” typically refer to
the project of using the cognitive faculties that are
“natural” to human beings—reason, sense-perception,
introspection—to investigate religious or theological
matters. Natural religion or theology, on the present understanding,
is not limited to empirical inquiry into nature, and it is not wedded
to a pantheistic result. It does, however, avoid appeals to special
non-natural faculties (ESP, telepathy, mystical experience) or
supernatural sources of information (sacred texts, revealed theology,
creedal authorities, direct supernatural communication). In general,
natural religion or theology (hereafter “natural
theology”) aims to adhere to the same standards of rational
investigation as other philosophical and scientific enterprises, and
is subject to the same methods of evaluation and critique.
Philosophers and religious thinkers across almost every epoch and
tradition (Near Eastern, African, Asian, and European) have engaged
the project of natural theology, either as proponents or critics. The
question of whether natural theology is a viable project is at the
root of some of the deepest religious divisions: Shiite thinkers are
optimistic about reason’s ability to prove various theological
and ethical truths, for instance, while Sunnis are not; Roman Catholic
theologians typically think that reason can demonstrate the existence
of God, while many Protestant theologians do not. Unlike most of the
topics discussed in an encyclopedia of philosophy, this is one over
which wars have been fought and throats have been cut.
The most active discussions of natural theology in the West
occurred during the high medieval period (roughly 1100–1400
C.E.) and the early modern period (1600–1800 C.E.). The past few
decades have witnessed a revival of debate in the public sphere: there
are now institutes promoting “Intelligent Design Theory”,
popular apologetics courses, campus debates between believers and
agnostics, a “New Atheist” movement, Youtube debates
between pastors and atheistic apologists regarding new books in
natural theology (such as the one between Nathan Lewis and Bernie
Dehler on the Blackwell Companion to Natural 
 Theology),[2]
 and TED talks by famous atheists on resisting natural
religion (such as the one by Richard Dawkins in February 
2002).[3]
Among professional philosophers (who aren’t typically part of
these more popular debates), arguments over our ability to justify
positive or negative answers to religious questions have become fairly
technical, often employing sophisticated logical techniques in an
effort to advance the discussion instead of retreading the same old
ground. The prestigious Gifford Lectures series hosted by a consortium
of Scottish universities, however, has tried to feature new but still
accessible work in natural theology for over 100 years (it too has a
 Youtube channel!)[4]
In this article, we aim to avoid most the more recent complexities
but also explain their origins by focusing on some central
developments in the early modern period that helped to frame
contemporary natural theological debates.

This entry examines the relevance of phenomenological considerations
for the concept of God (or the sacred otherwise characterised) and the
question of what sort of rational sense is implied in the adoption of
a religious point of view. The discussion distinguishes various
perspectives on the subjective character of religious experience, and
examines the relation between religious experience and experience of
the material world. It also considers the interaction between
experience, conceptual framework (including religious doctrine) and
practice, and the contribution, if any, of emotional feelings to the
epistemic significance of religious experience. In all of these ways,
an appreciation of the “phenomenology of religion” proves
central to an understanding of what is involved practically,
cognitively and affectively in a religious way of life.

Religious Experience,0.6628428101539612,0.5821951031684875,"

Religious experiences can be characterized generally as experiences
that seem to the person having them to be of some objective reality and to
have some religious import. That reality can be an individual, a state
of affairs, a fact, or even an absence, depending on the religious
tradition the experience is a part of. A wide variety of kinds of
experience fall under the general rubric of religious experience. The
concept is vague, and the multiplicity of kinds of experiences that
fall under it makes it difficult to capture in any general account. Part
of that vagueness comes from the term ‘religion,’ which is
difficult to define in any way that does not either rule out
institutions that clearly are religions, or include terms that can only
be understood in the light of a prior understanding of what religions
are. Nevertheless, we can make some progress in elucidating the concept
by distinguishing it from distinct but related concepts.

First, religious experience is to be distinguished from religious
feelings, in the same way that experience in general is to be
distinguished from feelings in general. A feeling of elation, for
example, even if it occurs in a religious context, does not count in
itself as a religious experience, even if the subject later comes to
think that the feeling was caused by some objective reality of
religious significance. An analogy with sense experience is helpful
here. If a subject feels a general feeling of happiness, not on account
of anything in particular, and later comes to believe the feeling was
caused by the presence of a particular person, that fact does not
transform the feeling of happiness into a perception of the person.
Just as a mental event, to be a perception of an object, must in
some sense seem to be an experience of that object, a
religiously oriented mental event, to be a religious experience, must
in some way seem to be an experience of a religiously
significant reality. So, although religious feelings may be involved in
many, or even most, religious experiences, they are not the same thing.
Discussions of religious experience in terms of feelings, like
Schleiermacher’s (1998) “feeling of absolute
dependence,” or Otto’s (1923) feeling of the numinous, were
important early contributions to theorizing about religious experience,
but some have since then argued (see Gellman 2001 and Alston 1991, for
example) that religious affective states are not all there is to
religious experience. To account for the experiences qua
experiences, we must go beyond subjective feelings.
 Religious experience is also to be distinguished from mystical
experience. Although there is obviously a close connection between the
two, and mystical experiences are religious experiences, not all
religious experiences qualify as mystical. The word
‘mysticism’ has been understood in many different ways.
James (1902) took mysticism to necessarily involve ineffability, which
would rule out many cases commonly understood to be mystical.  Alston
(1991) adopted the term grudgingly as the best of a bad lot and gave
it a semi-technical meaning. But in its common, non-technical sense,
mysticism is a specific religious system or practice, deliberately
undertaken in order to come to some realization or insight, to come to
unity with the divine, or to experience the ultimate reality
directly. At the very least, religious experiences form a broader
category; many religious experiences, like those of Saint Paul,
Arjuna, Moses, Muhammad, and many others come unsought, not as the
result of some deliberate practice undertaken to produce an
experience.

Religious Language,0.6620592474937439,0.5882835388183594,"

The principal aim of research on religious language is to give an
account of the meaning of religious sentences and utterances.
Religious sentences are generally taken to be have a religious subject
matter; a religious utterance is the production in speech or writing
of a token religious sentence. In principle, religious subject matters
could encompass a variety of agents, states of affairs or
properties—such as God, deities, angels, miracles, redemption,
grace, holiness, sinfulness. Most attention, however, has been devoted
to the meaning of what we say about God.

The scope of religious language and discourse could be construed more
widely. For instance, while The Song of Songs has little in
the way of distinctively religious content, it could be included in
the field because of its place within a religious canon.
Alternatively, the field could be characterised pragmatically to
include utterances which are used for religious purposes or in
religious contexts (Alston 2005: 220; Donovan 1976: 1; Soskice 1999:
349; Charlesworth 1974: 3). In practice, however, philosophical
treatments have not extended so broadly, instead focusing on sentences
and utterances with putatively religious content. This is partly
because it is difficult to find a principled characterisation of a
religious context that would delineate a philosophically interesting
scope for the topic. When a church congregation is told “Please
kneel”, this direction appears to be in a religious context and
have a religious purpose but it is difficult to see how the analysis
of the meaning of this instruction would informatively contribute to
the topic. It is also because the most pressing questions about
religious language seem to be those that come into alignment with
questions in other areas of philosophy of religion. Is there is
anything distinctive about the meanings of what we say about God and
other religious matters that are also the focus of metaphysical and
epistemological discussion? If, in talking about God, speakers are not
expressing propositions or not talking literally—to take a
couple of the more radical proposals—that would accordingly
require dramatic adjustments in approaching questions about knowledge
of God or God’s existence.

Research in the field has a lengthy history, with sustained discussion
of the meanings of religious expressions and utterances stretching
back at least to the middle of antiquity. Notable treatments of the
topic include the work by medieval theologians and philosophers
concerned with the meanings of divine predicates, including the
debates surrounding analogy and apophaticism (White 2010; Turner 1995;
Scott & Citron 2016), and debates about the meaningfulness of
religious language that were prompted by Ayer’s 1936
popularisation of logical positivism in Language, Truth and
Logic and remained a central issue in the philosophy of religion
through the mid-twentieth century. In recent years, religious language
has also become a topic of interest in continental philosophy (Derrida
1989 and 1992; Marion 1994 and 1995).

A distinction that guides the selection of material for this article
is between revisionary and non-revisionary accounts of religious
language. Non-revisionary theories aim to explain what religious
sentences and utterances mean. Revisionary theories, in contrast,
propose accounts of what religious language should mean or how it
should be used. While non-revisionary theories are descriptive of
religious language and should do justice to linguistic data,
revisionary theories are usually driven by metaphysical or
epistemological considerations. This article will mainly be concerned
with theories of the former type i.e., what religious utterances mean
rather than what they should mean.

Black Reparations,0.43228331208229065,0.7546085715293884,"
States have long demanded reparations from other states at the end
of wars. More recently non-state actors such as the Aborigines of
Australia, the Maori of New Zealand, and the Native Americans of North
America are demanding the return of their tribal lands from Europeans
as reparation; Eastern Europeans dispossessed by socialist governments
are demanding the return of their property as reparation; and African
Americans are demanding reparation for the injuries of slavery and its
aftermath. The last of these demands is our subject.

Replication and Reproduction,0.976876735687256,0.5361449718475342,"


The one property that distinguishes biological processes from most
other physical processes is that life is able to reproduce. How this
occurs has been explained in several ways, either as an autocatalytic
process or as an informational process, or both. Analogous issues arise
in other domains, such as cultural evolution. The notion of replication
has been proposed as the sine qua non of evolution, while reproduction
has classically been a defining feature of life. Even more recent
developments include a return to prominence of reproduction and its
physical aspects over information-based accounts.

Political Representation,0.42844012379646296,0.7064564824104309,"

The concept of political representation is misleadingly simple:
everyone seems to know what it is, yet few can agree on any particular
definition. In fact, there is an extensive literature that offers many
different definitions of this elusive concept. [Classic treatments of
the concept of political representations within this literature
include Pennock and Chapman 1968; Pitkin, 1967 and Schwartz, 1988.]
Hanna Pitkin (1967) provides, perhaps, one of the most straightforward
definitions: to represent is simply to “make present
again.” On this definition, political representation is the
activity of making citizens’ voices, opinions, and perspectives
“present” in public policy making processes. Political
representation occurs when political actors speak, advocate,
symbolize, and act on the behalf of others in the political arena. In
short, political representation is a kind of political assistance.
This seemingly straightforward definition, however, is not adequate as
it stands. For it leaves the concept of political representation
underspecified. Indeed, as we will see, the concept of political
representation has multiple and competing dimensions: our common
understanding of political representation is one that contains
different, and conflicting, conceptions of how political
representatives should represent and so holds representatives to
standards that are mutually incompatible. In leaving these dimensions
underspecified, this definition fails to capture this paradoxical
character of the concept.

This encyclopedia entry has three main goals. The first is to provide
a general overview of the meaning of political representation,
identifying the key components of this concept. The second is to
highlight several important advances that have been made by the
contemporary literature on political representation. These advances
point to new forms of political representation, ones that are not
limited to the relationship between formal representatives and their
constituents. The third goal is to reveal several persistent problems
with theories of political representation and thereby to propose some
future areas of research.

Scientific Representation,0.9109625220298768,0.5691623687744141,"

Science provides us with representations of atoms, elementary
particles, polymers, populations, genetic trees, economies, rational
decisions, aeroplanes, earthquakes, forest fires, irrigation systems,
and the world’s climate. It’s through these
representations that we learn about the world. This entry explores
various different accounts of scientific representation, with a
particular focus on how scientific models represent their
target systems. As philosophers of science are increasingly
acknowledging the importance, if not the primacy, of scientific models
as representational units of science, it’s important to stress
that how they represent plays a fundamental role in how we are to
answer other questions in the philosophy of science (for instance in the
scientific realism debate). This entry begins by disentangling
“the” problem of scientific representation, and then 
critically evaluates the current options available in the
literature.

Republicanism,0.4258507788181305,0.6120936870574951,"


In political theory and philosophy, the term
‘republicanism’ is generally used in two different, but
closely related, senses. In the first sense, republicanism refers to a
loose tradition or family of writers in the history of western
political thought, including especially: Machiavelli and his
fifteenth-century Italian predecessors; the English republicans
Milton, Harrington, Sidney, and others; Montesquieu and Blackstone;
the eighteenth-century English commonwealthmen; and many Americans of
the founding era such as Jefferson, Madison, and Adams. The writers in this
tradition emphasize many common ideas and concerns, such as the
importance of civic virtue and political participation, the dangers of
corruption, the benefits of a mixed constitution and the rule of law,
etc.; and it is characteristic of their rhetorical style to draw
heavily on classical examples—from Cicero and the Latin
historians especially—in presenting their arguments. (In light
of the last point, this is sometimes referred to as the
‘classical republican’ or ‘neo-roman’
tradition in political thought.)


Beyond this brief sketch, there
exists considerable historiographical controversy—with respect
to who the tradition’s members are, and their relative significance;
with respect to how we should interpret its underlying philosophical
commitments; and with respect to its role (especially vis-à-vis
liberalism) in the historical development of modern political
thought. This brings us to the second sense of the term
‘republicanism’. In contemporary political theory and
philosophy, it most often refers to a specific (and still contested)
interpretation of the classical republican tradition, associated
especially with the work of Quentin Skinner; together with a research
program dedicated to developing insights from this tradition into an
attractive contemporary political doctrine, associated especially with
the work of Philip Pettit. According to republicans in this second
sense (sometimes called ‘civic republicans’ or
‘neo-republicans’), the paramount republican value is
political liberty, understood as non-domination or independence from
arbitrary power. This entry will primarily discuss republicanism in
this second sense.


In their interpretation of the classical republicanism tradition,
civic republicans are often in debate with civic humanists, with
whom they are often confused (see the entry on 
 civic humanism).
 Developed as a contemporary political doctrine, civic republicanism
is broadly speaking progressive and liberal, but not without important
distinct features. Some of its policy implications diverge from
mainstream liberalism in particular ways, and for this reason civic
republicans are sometimes also confused with communitarians (see
the entry on 
 communitarianism).
 For the strengths or weakness of civic republicanism to be fairly
assessed, both confusions should be assiduously avoided.

The Repugnant Conclusion,0.6740884184837341,0.8803685307502747,"

In Derek Parfit’s original formulation the Repugnant Conclusion
is stated as follows: “For any possible population of at least
ten billion people, all with a very high quality of life, there must
be some much larger imaginable population whose existence, if other
things are equal, would be better even though its members have lives
that are barely worth living” (Parfit 1984). The Repugnant
Conclusion highlights a problem in an area of ethics which has become
known as population ethics. The last three decades have
witnessed an increasing philosophical interest in questions such as
“Is it possible to make the world a better place by creating
additional happy people?” and “Is there a moral obligation
to have children?” The main problem has been to find an adequate
theory about the moral value of states of affairs where the number of
people, the quality of their lives (or their life-time welfare or
well-being - we shall use these terms interchangeably here), and their
identities may vary. Since, arguably, any reasonable moral theory has
to take these aspects of possible states of affairs into account when
determining the normative status of actions, the study of population
ethics is of general import for moral theory. As the name indicates,
Parfit finds the Repugnant Conclusion unacceptable and many
philosophers agree. However, it has been surprisingly difficult to
find a theory that avoids the Repugnant Conclusion without implying
other equally counterintuitive conclusions. Thus, the question as to
how the Repugnant Conclusion should be dealt with and, more generally,
what it shows about the nature of ethics has turned the conclusion
into one of the cardinal challenges of modern ethics.

Respect,0.5106476545333862,0.7148953080177307,"


Respect has great importance in everyday life. As children we are
taught (one hopes) to respect our parents, teachers, and elders,
school rules and traffic laws, family and cultural traditions, other
people's feelings and rights, our country's flag and leaders, the
truth and people's differing opinions. And we come to value respect
for such things; when we're older, we may shake our heads (or fists)
at people who seem not to have learned to respect them. We develop
great respect for people we consider exemplary and lose respect for
those we discover to be clay-footed, and so we may try to respect only
those who are truly worthy of our respect. We may also come to believe
that, at some level, all people are worthy of respect. We may learn
that jobs and relationships become unbearable if we receive no respect
in them; in certain social milieus we may learn the price of
disrespect if we violate the street law: “Diss me, and you
die.” Calls to respect this or that are increasingly part of
public life: environmentalists exhort us to respect nature, foes of
abortion and capital punishment insist on respect for human life,
members of racial and ethnic minorities and those discriminated
against because of their gender, sexual orientation, age, religious
beliefs, or economic status demand respect both as social and moral
equals and for their cultural differences. And it is widely
acknowledged that public debates about such demands should take place
under terms of mutual respect. We may learn both that our lives
together go better when we respect the things that deserve to be
respected and that we should respect some things independently of
considerations of how our lives would go.


We may also learn that how our lives go depends every bit as much on
whether we respect ourselves. The value of self-respect may be
something we can take for granted, or we may discover how very
important it is when our self-respect is threatened, or we lose it and
have to work to regain it, or we have to struggle to develop or
maintain it in a hostile environment. Some people find that finally
being able to respect themselves is what matters most about getting
off welfare, kicking a disgusting habit, or defending something they
value; others, sadly, discover that life is no longer worth living if
self-respect is irretrievably lost. It is part of everyday wisdom that
respect and self-respect are deeply connected, that it is difficult if
not impossible both to respect others if we don't respect ourselves
and to respect ourselves if others don't respect us. It is
increasingly part of political wisdom both that unjust social
institutions can devastatingly damage self-respect and that robust and
resilient self-respect can be a potent force in struggles against
injustice.


The ubiquity and significance of respect and self-respect in everyday
life largely explains why philosophers, particularly in moral and
political philosophy, have been interested in these two concepts. They
turn up in a multiplicity of philosophical contexts, including
discussions of justice and equality, injustice and oppression,
autonomy and agency, moral and political rights and duties, moral
motivation and moral development, cultural diversity and toleration,
punishment and political violence.  The concepts are also invoked in
bioethics, environmental ethics, business ethics, workplace ethics,
and a host of other applied ethics contexts. Although a wide variety
of things are said to deserve respect, contemporary philosophical
interest in respect has overwhelmingly been focused on respect for
persons, the idea that all persons should be treated with respect
simply because they are persons. Respect for persons is a central
concept in many ethical theories; some theories treat it as the very
essence of morality and the foundation of all other moral duties and
obligations. This focus owes much to the 18th century
German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, who argued that all and only
persons (i.e., rational autonomous agents) and the moral law they
autonomously legislate are appropriate objects of the morally most
significant attitude of respect. Although honor, esteem, and
prudential regard played important roles in moral and political
theories before him, Kant was the first major Western philosopher to put
respect for persons, including oneself as a person, at the very center
of moral theory, and his insistence that persons are ends in
themselves with an absolute dignity who must always be respected has
become a core ideal of modern humanism and political liberalism. In
recent years many people have argued that moral respect ought also to
be extended to things other than persons, such as nonhuman living
things and the natural environment.


Despite the widespread acknowledgment of the importance of respect
and self-respect in moral and political life and theory, there is no
settled agreement in either everyday thinking or philosophical
discussion about such issues as how to understand the concepts, what
the appropriate objects of respect are, what is involved in respecting
various objects, what the conditions are for self-respect, and what
the scope is of any moral requirements regarding respect and
self-respect. This entry will survey these and related issues.

Collective Responsibility,0.5446732640266418,0.7991123199462891,"

The notion of collective responsibility, like that of
personal responsibility and shared responsibility,
refers in most contexts to both the causal responsibility of
moral agents for harm in the world and the blameworthiness that we
ascribe to them for having caused such harm. Hence, it is, like its
two more purely individualistic counterparts, almost always a notion
of moral, rather than purely causal, responsibility.
But, unlike its two more purely individualistic counterparts, it does
not associate either causal responsibility or blameworthiness with
discrete individuals or locate the source of moral responsibility in
the free will of individual moral agents. Instead, it associates both
causal responsibility and blameworthiness with groups and
locates the source of moral responsibility in the collective actions
taken by these groups understood as collectives.

Since this notion of collective responsibility makes groups, as
distinct from their individual members, out to be moral agents, it has
undergone a great deal of scrutiny in recent years by methodological
and normative individualists alike. Methodological individualists
challenge the very possibility of associating moral agency with
groups, as distinct from their individual members, and normative
individualists argue that collective responsibility violates
principles of both individual responsibility and fairness. In response
to these challenges, proponents of collective responsibility set out
to show that collective responsibility, as well as group intentions,
collective action, and group blameworthiness, are metaphysically
possible and can be ascribed to agents fairly in at least some, if not
all, cases.

While the vast majority of those now writing on collective
responsibility in philosophical circles continue to debate the
possibility of collective responsibility, a smaller group of scholars
has in recent years placed two further—and very
important—concerns at the center of our attention. The first has
to do with whether groups have to meet the same stringent conditions
of moral responsibility that individuals do. (Intentionality becomes a
primary site of controversy here.) The second has to do with the
advantages and disadvantages of holding particular kinds of groups,
e.g., nation states, races, and ethnic groups, morally responsible in
practice. 

The backward looking notion of collective responsibility cited above
is what most philosophers have in mind when they talk about collective
responsibility. But during the past several years there has been a
growing interest in what has come to be known as forward looking
collective responsibility. Forward looking collective
responsibility, unlike its backward looking counterpart, does not
focus on whether a particular collective agent caused harm in the
sense relevant to moral blameworthiness. Instead, it focuses on what,
if anything, the agent can be expected to do with respect to remedying
the harm. Hence, it is sometimes referred to as remedial
responsibility.

Revolution,0.4033306241035461,0.7064104676246643,"

The moral issues posed by revolutions are both practically important
and theoretically complex. There are also interesting conceptual
questions as to how to distinguish revolution from resistance,
rebellion, and secession, all of which also involve opposition to
existing political authority. Unfortunately, the recent renaissance in
just war theorizing focuses implicitly on interstate wars and thus has
largely ignored the morality of revolution, at least as a topic worthy
of systematic theorizing in its own
 right.[1]
 Recent work on the morality of asymmetrical warfare, on terrorism,
and on humanitarian military intervention provides valuable resources
for constructing a theory of the morality of revolution, but until the
appearance of Christopher Finlay’s book, Terrorism and the
Right to Resist: A Theory of Just Revolutionary War (2015),
nothing approaching a systematic account of the morality of revolution
has been
 available.[2]
 In other words, moral theorizing relevant to revolution has been
rather fragmentary and adventitious, because it has mainly occurred in
the pursuit of other topics rather than as part of an inquiry directed
squarely at the phenomenon of revolution. Furthermore, although
prominent figures in the history of Philosophy have held views on
revolution, they have primarily concentrated on the issue of just
cause (and in some cases on rightful authority to wage revolutionary
war), without addressing a number of other moral problems that
revolutions raise, such as the question of whether revolutionaries can
rightly use forms of violence that the armed forces of states are
morally prohibited from using and whether they may conscript fighters,
punish defectors and traitors, and expropriate property needed for the
struggle. There are hopeful signs, however, that moral theorists will
soon give revolution the attention it deserves.

The plan of this entry is as follows.
 Section 1
 discusses conceptual issues, distinguishing between different
understandings of revolution and between violent and nonviolent
revolution; it also distinguishes revolution from resistance,
rebellion and secession. Because violent revolution poses the most
serious and difficult moral issues, it will be the focus of the
remainder of the entry. The morality of nonviolent resistance to
political authority is itself sufficiently distinctive, significant
and complex to warrant a separate entry.

Section 2
 outlines in broad relief some of the major historical views on the
morality of revolution and demonstrates how far short of a
comprehensive account of just revolutionary war they fall.
 Section 3
 lays out seven morally relevant differences between revolutionary
wars and interstate wars that a theory of just revolutionary war
should heed.
 Section 4
 is structured by the traditional just war theory division between
jus ad bellum (the just initiation of war) and jus in
bello (the just conduct of war). With respect to the former, it
is argued that it is necessary to distinguish different moral issues
faced by different parties: the aspiring revolutionary leadership who
take it upon themselves to initiate revolutionary war and ordinary
individuals who are faced with the decision whether to join the
revolutionary struggle or not. This section, drawing on the
distinctive features of revolutionary wars set out in the preceding
section, identifies the special moral issues faced by the aspiring
revolutionary leadership, showing that the actions they must undertake
to have a good prospect of succeeding in war against the most
oppressive regimes are extremely morally problematic. It also shows
that these particular moral problems are obscured by mainstream just
war theory’s focus on war between states—in other words,
between entities that already have recognized leadership for war, are
already able to mobilize effective armed forces, and that have
legitimate political institutions or at least have access to resources
for constructing legitimacy. The aspiring revolutionary leadership, in
contrast, must struggle to achieve acknowledgment of its leadership in
the face of rival claimants to leadership, must mobilize forces for
war in spite of the regime’s imposition of extreme costs for
participation in revolution, must “punish” traitors and
informants, and yet typically lacks opportunities for establishing its
legitimacy with regard to the undertaking of any of these tasks. This
section emphasizes the difficulty of satisfying the requirement of
“rightful authority” for waging war in the case of
revolutionary wars. Also included here are critical discussions of
competing views on two issues central to just revolutionary war
theory: whether revolutionary warriors may use tactics and strategies
prohibited to combatants in interstate wars and whether revolutionary
war to overthrow “lesser tyrannies”, regimes that violate
civil and political rights but do not inflict killings, maimings, or
enslavement on their peoples, is justifiable.

The
 Conclusion
 emphasizes some of the major results of the investigation and
suggests two further topics that a comprehensive theory of just
revolutionary war should address: the morality of intervention in
revolution and how it is shaped by the morality of revolution; and the
moral assessment of the international Law of Armed Conflict’s
asymmetric treatment of the rights of combatants fighting on behalf of
states and revolutionary fighters.

At present, no set of competing theories of the morality of revolution
is currently available for critical comparison. Consequently, the
emphasis will be more on laying out the problems such theories should
address, rather than on setting out all of the alternatives for
addressing them.

Heinrich Rickert,0.6480597257614136,0.4927787780761719,"


Heinrich Rickert was born in Gdańsk (then Danzig, in Prussia)
on May 25th 1863. His father Heinrich Rickert Sr.
(1833–1902) was a politician and editor in Berlin. Heinrich Sr. was a
liberal democrat particularly invested in the cause of the German Jews.
In 1890 Heinrich Sr. founded the Society Against Anti-Semitism in
Berlin (Zijderveld 2006, 9). This is an interesting fact about Rickert
Jr.'s background, considering that he eventually worked to
support the appointment of philosophers of Jewish descent, such as
Edmund Husserl and Georg Simmel, who were not under the protective wing
of Hermann Cohen, the head of the Marburg School of Neo-Kantianism (see
below) and a very influential Jewish thinker.


Between 1884 and 1885 Rickert was enrolled at the University of
Berlin, where he attended lectures from the philosopher Friedrich
Paulsen (1846–1908). In 1885 he moved to Strasbourg (then
Straßburg and part of the Prussian Reich) where he
attended the Neo-Kantian philosopher Wilhelm Windelband's
lectures. Windelband (1848–1915) was a major source of inspiration for
Rickert's work and he completed a dissertation on The Theory
of Definition (Rickert 1915) under Windelband's supervision
in 1888. In the same year he married Sophie Keibel, a sculptor from
Berlin. They had four children.


In 1889 Rickert moved to Freiburg for health-related reasons.
Rickert's health was always precarious. After undergoing
intestinal surgery in 1896 he suffered lifelong intercostal neuralgia
and he developed agoraphobia. In spite of his health problems,
Rickert was able to complete his Habilitation under Alois
Riehl (1844–1924) in Freiburg, where he was appointed extraordinary
professor in 1894 and ordinary professor in 1896. The dissertation he
produced for the Habilitation, The Object of
Knowledge, is one of his most important works and a milestone in
early twentieth century Neo-Kantianism.


Rickert remained in Freiburg until 1915, when he accepted an offer
from the University of Heidelberg to replace his recently deceased
mentor Windelband, who had moved there from Strasbourg in 1903. He
taught in Heidelberg until 1932, when he retired. He died on July
25th 1936 in Heidelberg and was buried in Gdańsk.


Rickert had a long and successful academic career. He received several
awards and honorary degrees. He taught and in some cases supervised
important German thinkers of the next generation, such as Martin
Heidegger (1889–1976), Emil Lask (1875–1915) and Walter
Benjamin (1892–1940). He had close intellectual exchanges with
leading figures of his time, including Wilhelm Dilthey
(1833–1911), Georg Simmel (1858–1918), Edmund Husserl
(1859–1938), Max Weber (1864–1920) and Karl Jaspers
(1883–1969). Although very few of his writings are available in
English, in recent years there has been a growing interest in
Rickert's work, both to the extent that it influenced other
philosophers and as a significant contribution to the discipline in
its own right.


Rickert was a very prolific writer. He managed his publications in a
way that should strike the contemporary reader as familiar. He would
present new ideas and lines of inquiry first in exploratory journal
articles (many of them published in Logos, the journal he
founded in Freiburg) and subsequently he would incorporate them in
larger publications, often including previously published materials.
Following a common trend in his time, he kept working at his two major
books, The Object of Knowledge (first published in 1892) and
The Limits of Concept-Formation in Natural Science (first
published in 1902), for his entire life. Instead of writing new books
he would rewrite entire chapters and add new sections to his two
magna opera, thereby addressing criticism and
sometimes even changing significantly his previous views. So, for
instance, The Object of Knowledge grew from the 91 pages of
the first edition to the 460 pages of the sixth edition in 1928. This
style of writing makes the development of his thought particularly
perspicuous. However, in spite of his constant revisions and additions,
the fundamental principles of Rickert's philosophy remained
constant throughout his career. In keeping with his systematic
understanding of philosophy (see below), his approach to new problems
was geared towards connecting them to old problems, and his way of
handling criticism was often characterized by an effort to reformulate
his opponent's views so as to make them compatible with his
own.

Paul Ricoeur,0.6432585716247559,0.5698671936988831,"

Paul Ricoeur (1913–2005) was a distinguished French philosopher
of the twentieth century, one whose work has been widely translated
and discussed across the world. In addition to his academic work, his
public presence as a social and political commentator, particularly in
France, led to a square in Paris being named in his honor on the
centenary of his birth in 2013. In the course of his long career he
wrote on a broad range of issues. In addition to his many books,
Ricoeur published more than 500 essays, many of which appear in
collections in English.

A major theme that runs through Ricoeur’s writings is that of a
philosophical anthropology. Ricoeur came to formulate this as the idea
of the “capable human being”. In it he seeks to give an
account of the fundamental capabilities and vulnerabilities that human
beings display in the activities that make up their lives, and to show
how these capabilities enable responsible human action and life
together. Though the accent is always on the possibility of
understanding human beings as agents responsible for their actions,
Ricoeur consistently rejects any claim that the self is immediately
transparent to itself or fully master of itself. Self-knowledge only
comes through our understanding of our relation to the world and of
our life with and among others in time in the world.

In the course of developing this anthropology, Ricoeur made several
major methodological shifts, partly in response to changes in his
intellectual setting as new developments came to speak to the topics
he was dealing with, sometimes in ways that challenged his own
approach, partly as he pursued questions that had arisen in his
published work or that had not yet been considered there. His academic
training was in the tradition of French reflexive philosophy, a
tradition that seeks to understand how the “I” comes to be
aware of itself and of its thought and action starting from the lived
experience of reflexive consciousness, our being aware of ourselves as
existing, thinking, and acting. This focus on reflexive consciousness
always played a role in organizing Ricoeur’s thinking. His first
major publications after World War II, though, were written in the
language of existential phenomenology, reflecting not just his study
of Husserl, which had begun prior to World War II but also of Karl
Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.
By 1960, however, Ricoeur had concluded that to study human reality
properly, particularly in relation to the existence of evil, he had to
combine phenomenological description with hermeneutic interpretation.
This shift led to an increasing focus on a theory of interpretation
that could be grafted to phenomenology, an approach which he came to
see was in fact called for by phenomenology. For this hermeneutic
phenomenology, whatever is intelligible comes to us in and through our
use of language. While philosophical language always aims at univocal
concepts, actually used language is always polysemic; it can have more
than one meaning, more than one translation, so all uses of language
necessarily call for interpretation. This hermeneutic or linguistic
turn in Ricoeur’s thought did not require him to disavow the
basic results of his earlier investigations. It did, however, lead him
not only to revisit that work but also to see more clearly its broader
implications, particularly in relation to and in response to the
development of structuralism which he saw as a challenge to such a
hermeneutic approach. In his later work, this led to an increasing
emphasis on the fact that we live in time and in history.  He took up
this insight through the philosophy of discourse that he developed on
the basis of the increased emphasis on language in his philosophy. His
late writings also reflect a more direct concern for making sense of
selfhood and personal identity as something that goes beyond the
epistemological subject, and for ethics at the individual as well as
the societal and political levels, leading to his essays on the idea
of the just and his last book on the possibility of mutual recognition
and states of peace.

Rights,0.44434425234794617,0.7376039028167725,"


Rights are entitlements (not) to perform certain actions, or (not) to
be in certain states; or entitlements that others (not) perform
certain actions or (not) be in certain states.


Rights dominate modern understandings of what actions are permissible
and which institutions are just. Rights structure the form of
governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is
currently perceived. To accept a set of rights is to approve a
distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain
view of what may, must, and must not be done.


This entry begins by describing the nature of rights: their
classification, their composition, and their function. It then reviews
the history of the language of rights, and various relationships
between rights and reasons. The major contemporary philosophical
approaches to the justification of rights are compared, and the entry
concludes by surveying criticisms of rights and “rights
talk.” The focus throughout is on general theoretical issues
instead of on the analysis or justification of specific rights or
types of rights. Those looking for fuller introductions to rights may
consider Jones (1994), Harel (2005), Campbell (2006), Ivison (2007)
and Edmundson (2012).

Children's Rights,0.5085499286651611,0.7890835404396057,"
 Children are young human beings. Some children are very young
human beings. As human beings children evidently have a certain moral
status.  There are things that should not be done to them for the
simple reason that they are human. At the same time children are
different from adult human beings and it seems reasonable to think
that there are things children may not do that adults are permitted to
do. In the majority of jurisdictions, for instance, children are not
allowed to vote, to marry, to buy alcohol, to have sex, or to engage
in paid employment.  What makes children a special case for
philosophical consideration is this combination of their humanity and
their youth, or, more exactly, what is thought to be associated with
their youth. One very obvious way in which the question of what
children are entitled to do or to be or to have is raised is by
asking, Do children have rights? If so, do they have all the rights
that adults have and do they have rights that adults do not have? If
they do not have rights how do we ensure that they are treated in the
morally right way? Most jurisdictions accord children legal
rights. Most countries—though not the United States of
America—have ratified the United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child which was first adopted in 1989. The Convention
accords to children a wide range of rights including, most centrally,
the right to have their ‘best interests’ be ‘a
primary consideration’ in all actions concerning them (Article
3), the ‘inherent right to life’ (Article 6), and the
right of a child “who is capable of forming his or her own views
… to express these views freely in all matters affecting the
child” (Article 12) (United Nations 1989). However it is normal
to distinguish between ‘positive’ rights, those that are
recognised in law, and ‘moral’ rights, those that are
recognised by some moral theory. That children have
‘positive’ rights does not then settle the question of
whether they do or should have moral rights. However there are at
least good political reasons why one might think that the UNCRC
provides an exemplary statement – in the language of positive
rights – of how children should be treated and
regarded. Nevertheless the idea of children as rights holders has been
subject to different kinds of philosophical criticism At the same time
there has been philosophical consideration of what kinds of rights
children have if they do have any rights at all. The various debates
shed light on both the nature and value of rights, and on the moral
status of children. 
These matters, to be considered below, need also to be seen as
closely tied to at least two other philosophical questions: what is
childhood? (See the entry on childhood.)
And, how do the putative rights of children stand in relation to the
rights of those adults who, arguably, have rights over children? The
first question is considered at length in Part I of Archard
(2015). The second question broaches the issues of parental rights and
responsibilities. (See the entry on
 procreation and parenthood.)

Rigid Designators,0.7962207198143005,0.6267585754394531,"

A rigid designator designates the same object in all possible worlds
in which that object exists and never designates anything else. This
technical concept in the philosophy of language has critical
consequences felt throughout philosophy. In their fullest generality,
the consequences are metaphysical and epistemological. Whether a
statement's designators are rigid or non-rigid may determine whether
it is necessarily true, necessarily false, or contingent. This
metaphysical status is sometimes out of accord with what one would
expect given a statement's apparent epistemological status as a
posteriori or a priori. Statements affected include central ones under
investigation in philosophical subdisciplines from the philosophy of
science to mind to ethics and aesthetics. Hence, much of the
discussion in various subdisciplines of philosophy is explicitly or
implicitly framed around the distinction between rigid and non-rigid
designators.

Richard Rorty,0.6939157247543335,0.6513183116912842,"


Richard Rorty (1931–2007) developed a distinctive and
controversial brand of pragmatism that expressed itself along two main
axes. One is negative—a critical diagnosis of what Rorty takes
to be defining projects of modern philosophy. The other is
positive—an attempt to show what intellectual culture might look
like, once we free ourselves from the governing metaphors of mind and
knowledge in which the traditional problems of epistemology and
metaphysics (and indeed, in Rorty's view, the self-conception of
modern philosophy) are rooted. The centerpiece of Rorty's critique is
the provocative account offered in Philosophy and the Mirror of
Nature (1979, hereafter PMN). In this book, and in the closely
related essays collected in Consequences of Pragmatism (1982,
hereafter CP), Rorty's principal target is the philosophical idea of
knowledge as representation, as a mental mirroring of a mind-external
world.  Providing a contrasting image of philosophy, Rorty has sought
to integrate and apply the milestone achievements of Dewey, Hegel and
Darwin in a pragmatist synthesis of historicism and naturalism.
Characterizations and illustrations of a post-epistemological
intellectual culture, present in both PMN (part III) and CP
(xxxvii-xliv), are more richly developed in later works, such as
Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (1989, hereafter CIS), in
the popular essays and articles collected in Philosophy and Social
Hope (1999), and in the four volumes of philosophical papers,
Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth (1991, hereafter ORT);
Essays on Heidegger and Others (1991, hereafter EHO);
Truth and Progress (1998, hereafter TP); and Philosophy
as Cultural Politics (2007, hereafter PCP). In these writings,
ranging over an unusually wide intellectual territory, Rorty offers a
highly integrated, multifaceted view of thought, culture, and
politics, a view that has made him one of the most widely discussed
philosophers in our time.

Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy,0.6192724108695984,0.5358641147613525,"

Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy (1888–1973) was a sociologist and social
philosopher who, along with his close friend Franz Rosenzweig, and
Ferdinand Ebner and Martin Buber, was a major exponent of speech
thinking or dialogicism. The central insight of speech thinking is
that speech or language is not merely, or even primarily, a
descriptive act, but a responsive and creative act which is the basis
of our social
 existence.[1]
 The greater part of Rosenstock-Huessy's work was devoted to
demonstrating how speech/language, through its unpredictable
fecundity, expands our powers and, through its inescapably historical
forming character, also binds them. According to Rosenstock-Huessy,
speech makes us collective masters of time and gives us the ability to
overcome historical death by founding new, more expansive and
fulfilling spaces of social-life.

Rosenstock-Huessy also belonged to that post-Nietzschean revival of
religious thought which included Franz Rosenzweig, Karl Barth, Leo
Weismantel, Hans and Rudolf Ehrenberg, Viktor von Weizsäcker,
Martin Buber, Lev Shestov, Hugo Bergmann, Florens Christian Range,
Nikolai Berdyaev, Margaret Susman, Werner Picht (all of whom were
involved in the Patmos publishing house and its offshoot Die
Kreatur) and Paul Tillich. Common to this group was the belief
that religious speech, which they saw as distinctly not metaphysical,
disclosed layers of experience and creativity (personal and
socio-historical) which remain inaccessible to the metaphysics of
naturalism.

Franz Rosenzweig,0.6188791394233704,0.5355319380760193,"


Franz Rosenzweig (1886–1929) ranks as one of the most original Jewish
thinkers of the modern period. As a historian of philosophy,
Rosenzweig played a brief but noteworthy role in the neo-Hegelian
revival on the German intellectual scene of the 1910s. In the years
immediately following the First World War, he sought to bring about
the “total renewal of thinking” through a novel synthesis
of philosophy and theology he named the “new thinking.”
Rosenzweig's account of revelation as a call from the Absolute other
helped shape the course of early 20th-century Jewish and
Christian theology. His reflections on human finitude and on the
temporal contours of human experience made a lasting impact on
20th-century existentialism; and his account of dialogue
presented the interpersonal relation between “I” and
“You” as both constitutive of selfhood and as yielding
redemptive communal consequences. Rosenzweig engaged in two major
works of translation, most notably the German translation of the Bible
in which he collaborated with Martin Buber. He founded a center for
Jewish adult education in
Frankfurt—the Lehrhaus—which attracted the most
important young German-Jewish intellectuals of its time, and which is
still held up today as a model for educational programs of its
type.


Rosenzweig's renown, especially in Jewish and Christian
intellectual circles, stems in large part from a fascination with his
compelling biography, a biography that included a near-conversion to
Christianity, an inspired return to Judaism, the composition of the
beginning of his magnum opus on military postcards sent home
from the Balkan front, the abandonment of a promising academic career
in order to live and teach in the Frankfurt Jewish community, and his
heroic efforts to continue his thinking, writing, and communal work
after succumbing to the paralysis brought on by ALS. But
Rosenzweig's singular philosophical importance rests almost
entirely on his having written what is arguably the greatest work of
modern Jewish philosophy: The Star of Redemption. The
Star is a system of philosophy that seeks to give a
comprehensive and ramified account of “All” that is, and of
the human being's place within that “All”. It is a
system in which “revelation” plays a vital conceptual and
methodological role, and in which Judaism and Christianity are claimed
to offer glimpses, each through the course of its liturgical calendar,
of the redemptive unity of the “All” which the philosopher
seeks to know.

Antonio Rosmini,0.5415559411048889,0.5806732177734375,"


Antonio Rosmini (1797–1855), Italian priest, philosopher, theologian
and patriot, and founder of a religious congregation, aimed principally
in his philosophical work at re-addressing the balance between reason
and religion which had largely been lost as a result of the
Enlightenment. To this purpose, he absorbed the tradition of
philosophia perennis, read extensively the works of
post-Renaissance philosophers, and developed his own views on
philosophical fundamentals and many of their applications. Best known
in Italy, but a controversial figure there during his life and for a
century or more after his death, his philosophical work, centred upon
the notion of being and the dignity of the human person, can be
summarised under the headings: aims and method, the objectivity of
thought and the concept of certainty; the dignity of the human person;
morality; human rights; the nature of human society; natural theology;
and being. The following article will examine Rosmini’s work under
these titles, which are of perennial relevance and broad enough to
embrace more particular themes, such as art, politics, education and
marriage, which form a constant preoccupation of many of his lesser
works, but can only be mentioned in passing here. His theological
principles, other than those pertaining to natural theology, are
considered only in so far as they throw light on the origin and
development of his philosophical tenets.

Sir William David Ross (1877–1971) made significant contributions to the translation and interpretation of the works of Aristotle and to
moral philosophy. His work in ancient philosophy, especially his various commentaries on Aristotle, is still considered to be of the highest caliber. Many believe
that Ross's work in this area is his most valuable
contribution to philosophy. However, his main writings in moral
philosophy are of lasting if not equal value. His The Right and the Good is
arguably one of the most important works of moral philosophy published
in the twentieth century. Although Ross's view appeared
to suffer at the hands of critics in the middle and late parts of the
last century, recent interest in normative and meta-ethical
intuitionism has sparked a renewed respect for and admiration of his
unique contribution to ethics, which is the focus of this

Jean Jacques Rousseau,0.4643671810626984,0.6303204894065857,"


Jean-Jacques Rousseau remains an important figure in the history of
philosophy, both because of his contributions to political philosophy
and moral psychology and because of his influence on later thinkers.
Rousseau’s own view of philosophy and philosophers was firmly negative,
seeing philosophers as the post-hoc rationalizers of self-interest, as
apologists for various forms of tyranny, and as playing a role in the
alienation of the modern individual from humanity’s natural impulse to
compassion. The concern that dominates Rousseau’s work is to find a way
of preserving human freedom in a world where human beings are
increasingly dependent on one another for the satisfaction of their
needs. This concern has two dimensions: material and psychological, of
which the latter has greater importance. In the modern world, human
beings come to derive their very sense of self from the opinion of
others, a fact which Rousseau sees as corrosive of freedom and
destructive of individual authenticity. In his mature work, he
principally explores two routes to achieving and protecting freedom:
the first is a political one aimed at constructing political
institutions that allow for the co-existence of free and equal citizens
in a community where they themselves are sovereign; the second is a
project for child development and education that fosters autonomy and
avoids the development of the most destructive forms of self-interest.
However, though Rousseau believes the co-existence of human beings in
relations of equality and freedom is possible, he is consistently and
overwhelmingly pessimistic that humanity will escape from a dystopia of
alienation, oppression, and unfreedom. In addition to his contributions
to philosophy, Rousseau was active as a composer and a music theorist,
as the pioneer of modern autobiography, as a novelist, and as a
botanist. Rousseau’s appreciation of the wonders of nature and his
stress on the importance of feeling and emotion made him an important
influence on and anticipator of the romantic movement. To a very large
extent, the interests and concerns that mark his philosophical
work also inform these other activities, and Rousseau’s contributions in
ostensibly non-philosophical fields often serve to illuminate his
philosophical commitments and arguments.

Josiah Royce,0.3600732386112213,0.8223217129707336,"


Josiah Royce (1855–1916) was the leading American proponent of absolute
idealism, the metaphysical view (also maintained by G. W. F. Hegel and
F. H. Bradley) that all aspects of reality, including those we
experience as disconnected or contradictory, are ultimately unified in
the thought of a single all-encompassing consciousness. Royce also made
original contributions in ethics, philosophy of community, philosophy
of religion and logic. His major works include The Religious Aspect
of Philosophy (1885), The World and the Individual
(1899–1901), The Philosophy of Loyalty (1908), and The
Problem of Christianity (1913). Royce's friendly but longstanding
dispute with William James, known as “The Battle of the Absolute,”
deeply influenced both philosophers' thought. In his later works, Royce
reconceived his metaphysics as an “absolute pragmatism” grounded in
semiotics. This view dispenses with the Absolute Mind of previous
idealism and instead characterizes reality as a universe of ideas or
signs which occur in a process of being interpreted by an infinite
community of minds. These minds, and the community they constitute, may
themselves be understood as signs. Royce's ethics, philosophy of
community, philosophy of religion, and logic reflect this metaphysical
position.

Bertrand Russell,0.8602390885353088,0.6903921961784363,"


Bertrand Arthur William Russell (1872–1970) was a British
philosopher, logician, essayist and social critic best known for his
work in mathematical logic and analytic philosophy. His most
influential contributions include his championing of logicism (the
view that mathematics is in some important sense reducible to logic),
his refining of Gottlob Frege’s predicate
calculus (which still forms the basis of most contemporary systems of
logic), his defense of neutral monism
(the view that the world consists of just one type of substance which
is neither exclusively mental nor exclusively physical), and his
theories of
 definite descriptions,
 logical atomism and logical types. 


Together with
G.E.  Moore,
 Russell is generally recognized as one of the main founders of modern
analytic philosophy. His famous paradox, 
theory of types, and work with 
A.N. Whitehead on
Principia Mathematica 
reinvigorated the study of logic throughout the
twentieth century (Schilpp 1944, xiii; Wilczek 2010, 74).


Over the course of a long career, Russell also made significant
contributions to a broad range of other subjects, including
 ethics, politics, educational theory, the
history of ideas and religious studies, cheerfully ignoring
Hooke’s admonition to the Royal Society against “meddling
with Divinity, Metaphysics, Moralls, Politicks, Grammar, Rhetorick, or
Logick” (Kreisel 1973, 24). In addition, generations of general
readers have benefited from his many popular writings on a wide
variety of topics in both the humanities and the natural
sciences. Like Voltaire, to whom he has
been compared (Times of London 1970, 12)), he wrote with style and wit
and had enormous influence.


After a life marked by controversy—including dismissals from
both Trinity College, Cambridge, and City College, New
York—Russell was awarded the Order of Merit in 1949 and the
Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950. Noted also for his many spirited
anti-nuclear protests and for his campaign against western
involvement in the Vietnam War, Russell remained a prominent
public figure until his death at the age of 97.

Russell's Moral Philosophy,0.6481245756149292,0.81261146068573,"


Russell remains famous as a logician, a metaphysician, and as a
philosopher of mathematics, but in his own day he was also notorious
for his social and political opinions. He wrote an immense amount
about practical ethics—women's rights, marriage and morals, war
and peace, and the vexed question of whether socialists should smoke
good cigars.  (They should.) And unlike present-day practical
ethicists (with a few notable exceptions such as Peter Singer) he was
widely read by the non-philosophical public (see for instance Phillips
2013, which details Russell's successes as a popular moralist in the
1950s). But though Russell was famous as a moralist and famous as a
philosopher, he does not have much of a reputation as a moral
philosopher in the more technical sense of the term.  Until very
recently, his contributions to what is nowadays known as ethical
theory—meta-ethics (the nature and justification, if any,
of moral judgments) and normative ethics (what makes right acts right
etc)—were either unknown, disregarded or dismissed as
unoriginal. Key texts on the history of twentieth century
ethics—Warnock's Ethics Since 1900 (1978),
Urmson's The Emotivist Theory of Ethics (1968),
Milller's Contemporary Metaethics: an Introduction (2013) and
Schroeder's Non-Cognitivism in Ethics (2010)—say
nothing, or next to nothing, about Russell, at least in his capacity
as a moral philosopher. It is only very recently—in the last
fifteen years or so—that ethical theorists have begun to pay
attention to him (see Pigden (2003) and (2007) and Potter (2006), though
L.W. Aiken (1963) anticipated Potter and Pigden by about forty
years). Perhaps Russell would not have repined, since he professed
himself dissatisfied with what he had said “on the
philosophical basis of ethics” (RoE:
165/Papers 11: 310). But since he took an equally dim view of
what he had read on that topic, the fact that he did not
think much of his own contributions does not mean that he thought them
any worse than anybody else's. In my view, they are often rather
better and deserve to be disinterred. But “disinterred” is
the word since some of his most original contributions were left
unpublished in his own lifetime and what he did publish was
often buried in publications ostensibly devoted to less theoretical
topics. Thus Russell's brilliant little paper “Is There an Absolute
Good”, which anticipates Mackie's “The Refutation of
Morals” by over twenty years, was delivered in 1922 at a meeting
of the Apostles (an exclusive, prestigious but secret Cambridge
discussion group of which Moore, Russell, and Ramsey were all members)
and was not published until 1988. And Russell's version of emotivism
(which anticipates Ayer's Language, Truth and Logic (1936) by
one year, and Stevenson's “The Emotive Meaning of Ethical
Terms” (1937) by two) appeared towards the end of a popular
book, Religion and Science (1935), whose principal purpose
was not to discuss the nature of moral judgments, but to do down
religion in the name of science. However, Russell's dissatisfaction
with his writings on ethical theory did not extend to his writings on
social and political topics.
I have no difficulty in practical moral judgments,
which I find I make on a roughly hedonistic
[i.e., utilitarian] basis, but, when it comes to the
philosophy of moral judgments, I am impelled in two opposite
directions and remain perplexed. (RoE:
165–6/Papers 11: 311)

His perplexity, however, was theoretical rather than practical. He
was pretty clear about what we ought to do (work for world
government, for example), but “perplexed” about what he
meant when he said that we ought to do it.


One point to stress, before we go on. Russell took a pride in his
willingness to change his mind. Obstinacy in the face of
counter-arguments was not, in his opinion, a virtue in a
scientifically-minded philosopher. Unfortunately he overdid the
open-mindedness, abandoning good theories for worse ones in the face
of weak counter-arguments and sometimes forgetting some of his own
best insights (a forgivable fault in given the fountain of good ideas
that seemed to be continually erupting in his head). Russell's mental
development, therefore, is not always a stirring tale of intellectual
progress. His first thoughts are often better than his second thoughts
and his second thoughts better than his third thoughts. Thus the
emotivism that was his dominant view in the latter part of his life is
vulnerable to objections that he himself had raised in an earlier
incarnation, as was the error theory that he briefly espoused in 1922.
Nobody should be surprised, therefore, if I sometimes deploy an
earlier Russell to criticize one of his later selves. Whitehead is
reported to have said that Russell was a Platonic dialogue in himself,
and in this temporally extended debate quite often it is one of the
younger Russells who wins the argument.

Gilbert Ryle,0.7635126113891602,0.4704656004905701,"


Although Gilbert Ryle published on a wide range of topics in
philosophy (notably in the history of philosophy and in philosophy of
language), including a series of lectures centred on philosophical
dilemmas, a series of articles on the concept of thinking, and a book
on Plato, The Concept of Mind remains his best known and most
important work. Through this work, Ryle is thought to have
accomplished two major tasks. First, he was seen to have put the final
nail in the coffin of Cartesian dualism. Second, as he himself
anticipated, he is thought to have argued on behalf of, and suggested
as dualism's replacement, the doctrine known as
philosophical (and sometimes analytical)
behaviourism. Sometimes known as an “ordinary
language”, sometimes as an “analytic” philosopher,
Ryle—even when mentioned in the same breath as Wittgenstein and
his followers—is considered to be on a different, somewhat
idiosyncratic (and difficult to characterise), philosophical
track.


Philosophical behaviourism has long been rejected; what was worth
keeping has been appropriated by the philosophical doctrine of
functionalism, which is the most widely accepted view in philosophy of
mind today. It is a view that is thought to have saved the
“reality” of the mental from the
“eliminativist” or “fictionalist” tendencies of
behaviourism while acknowledging the insight (often attributed to Ryle)
that the mental is importantly related to behavioural output or
response (as well as to stimulus or input). According to a
reasonably charitable assessment, the best of Ryle's lessons has
long been assimilated while the problematic has been discarded.
If there are considerations still brewing from the 1930s and 40s that
would threaten the orthodoxy in contemporary philosophy of mind, these
lie somewhere in work of Wittgenstein and his followers—not in
Ryle.


But the view just outlined, though widespread, represents a
fundamental misapprehension of Ryle's work. First,
Cartesianism is dead in only one of its ontological aspects: substance
dualism may well have been repudiated but property dualism still claims
a number of contemporary defenders. The problem of finding a
place for the mental in the physical world, of accommodating the causal
power of the mental, and of accounting for the phenomenal aspects of
consciousness are all live problems in the philosophy of mind today
because they share some of the doctrine's ontological,
epistemological, and semantic assumptions.


Second, and importantly, Ryle is not a philosophical
behaviourist—at least he does not subscribe to any of the main
tenets associated with that doctrine as it is known today. One
may be confused by this if one is also confused about Ryle's
conception of philosophy. Although there is some truth in
identifying him as an analytic philosopher—he announces (1932,
61) that “the sole and whole function of philosophy” is
philosophical analysis—this is likely to be misunderstood today
if one thinks that the proper goal of philosophy (attainable if not in
practice at least in ideals) is definitional analysis. It is this
that encourages the association with behaviourism (in at least one of
its many senses). But Ryle was not an analytical philosopher in
this sense. True, Ryle acknowledges the influence of Moore's
emphasis on common sense (and thus on ordinary language); true, he
takes himself to be pursuing the type of philosophical investigation
(exemplified by Russell's Theory of Descriptions) that involves
uncovering the logical form of grammatically misleading
expressions. But it is important to take account of the
differences that separate Ryle from the early Moore and Russell for it
is their conception of philosophy that has been inherited by many of us
working within the “analytic” tradition in philosophy
today. That is the third point. For Ryle does not believe
in meanings (concepts or propositions) as these have been
traditionally construed (as stable objects or rules, the grasp of which
is logically prior to, and thus may be used to explain, the use of
expressions). Indeed, Ryle's conception of philosophy
was not fundamentally different from that of Wittgenstein. Ryle
sets out in print as early as 1932 a philosophical agenda that
prefigures the published work of the later Wittgenstein; the
“elasticity of significance” and “inflections of
meaning” Ryle finds in most expressions appear to be the family
of structures, more or less related, noticed by Wittgenstein; and
Ryle's attack on the “intellectualist legend” shares
Wittgenstein's concern to understand a
proper—non-exalted—place for rules in an explanation of
various philosophically interesting achievements. In spite of the
fact that some of Wittgenstein's protégés were
dismissive of Ryle's
 work,[1]
the best way to understand Ryle is to see him,
if not as following in Wittgenstein's footsteps, then as walking
some stretches of philosophical terrain down a parallel path.

Śāntarakṣita,0.4752444922924042,0.3278807103633881,"


Śāntarakṣita 
 (725–788)[1]
 was one of the most important and pivotal thinkers in the history of 
Indian and Tibetan Buddhist 
 philosophy.[2]
 His contributions to Buddhist thought were particularly noteworthy 
due to his historical position as one of the later Indian 
interpreters of the Madhyamaka thought of Nāgārjuna 
(ca. 1st–2nd c.). This was an historical position which 
allowed him to consider many important developments (both inside and 
outside the Madhyamaka tradition) that preceded 
 him.[3]
 The central claim of the Madhyamaka School is that all phenomena are 
empty (śūnya) of any intrinsic nature, unchanging 
essence, or absolute mode of being. This was the central idea in 
Śāntarakṣita’s thought as well, however, he was a 
commentator on both Nāgārjuna and Dharmakīrti in equal
measure. In fact, Śāntarakṣita attempted to integrate
the anti-essentialism of Nāgārjuna with the 
logico-epistemological thought of Dignāga (ca. 6th c.)
and Dharmakīrti (ca. 7th c.) along with facets of 
 Yogācāra/Cittamātra[4]
 thought into one internally consistent, yet fundamentally Madhyamaka 
system. His innovative integration of facets of the three into a 
Madhyamaka framework of analysis are exemplary of the unique fruits 
which benefit from his historical local. The synthesis of these three
major movements in Indian Buddhist philosophy was perhaps his most 
important contribution, among many, to the Indian Buddhist 
philosophical tradition. This synthesis, which was also taken up by 
his disciples (important philosophers in their own right) such as 
Kamalaśīla and to a lesser extent, Haribhadra, has been 
characterized as the last major development in Indian Buddhist 
philosophy. Śāntarakṣita was a dynamic thinker and a 
scholar with both breadth and depth of knowledge of the Indian 
philosophical traditions. He encouraged his readers to actively 
engage with a host of non-Buddhist and Buddhist philosophical 
positions as they ascended a sort of hierarchy of philosophical 
views, a hierarchy that—in his opinion—culminates in the 
Madhyamaka view.


However, Śāntarakṣita’s contribution to Buddhist
philosophy as a whole did not stop in India. He made two trips to
Tibet and ultimately spent the last fifteen years of his life there.
Śāntarakṣita was one of the most influential figures
in the early dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet, founding the first
Buddhist monastery at Samyé (bsam yas), serving as its first abbot, ordaining the
first seven Tibetan monks, and establishing a system of rigorous
philosophical study based upon the traditions of learning at the great
Indian Buddhist monastic universities such as Nalanda and
Vikramaśīla. In affect, Śāntarakṣita (and
later, his disciple Kamalaśīla) taught Tibetans how to do
philosophy. He introduced Tibetans to a plethora of Indian
philosophical views, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, and taught them
how to study, critically analyze, and meditate upon these
ideas. Several important qualities of Śāntarakṣita’s
thought that were unique to him in India, became a fully
integrated modus operandi of philosophy in Tibet including
his dynamic engagement with competing philosophical views and his
integration of Madhyamaka and logico-epistemological thought. As such
his influence impacted the spectrum of Tibetan philosophical
literature, from the earliest philosophical doxographies such as Yeshe
De’s (ca. 8th c.)
Distinguishing the Views (lta ba khyad par) to the 
commentaries and treatises of towering indigenous Tibetan 
philosophers such as Chaba Chökyi Senge (phwya pa chos kyi 
seng ge) (1109–1169), Sakya Pandita (sa skya 
paṇḍita) (1182–1251), Tsongkhapa (tsong 
kha pa) (1357–1419) and Mipham Gyatso (mi pham rgya

Wesley Charles Salmon (1925–2001) was a central figure in
twentieth century philosophy of science. Working in the tradition of
Hume, Salmon developed a sophisticated version of empiricism combining
a genuinely probabilistic approach with realism about theoretical
entities. Salmon’s writings, characterized by a systematic and
crystal-clear style, cover a wide range of topics including logic, the
philosophy of space and time, the foundations of probability and
scientific inference, rationality, realism, and scientific
explanation, a major focus of his production for more than thirty
years. Unlike the Hempelian “received view”, Salmon
developed a concept of explanation according to which to explain means
to exhibit the causal mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of
phenomena. Convinced that our knowledge is uncertain and that
causality ought to be defined in probabilistic terms, he pursued a
probabilistic version of mechanicism, opening a new trend of research
in the literature on explanation, known as
“neo-mechanicism”. Salmon’s views on all the topics
he addressed continue to nurture fresh reflection and ongoing
debate.

After a biographical note (section 1), this entry surveys
Salmon’s views on probability (section 2), confirmation (section
3), space and time (section 4), explanation and causality (section 5),
rationality and realism (section 6). Albeit necessary in this kind of
essay, such partitioning is somewhat artificial, because
Salmon’s ideas are strictly interconnected: his conception of
causal explanation relies on his frequency view of probability and
substantiates a concept of rationality that regards causal knowledge
of phenomena as crucial for our understanding of both the world and
human action.

Philosopher, poet, literary and cultural critic, George Santayana is
a principal figure in Classical American Philosophy. His naturalism and
emphasis on creative imagination were harbingers of important
intellectual turns on both sides of the Atlantic. He was a naturalist
before naturalism grew popular; he appreciated multiple perfections
before multiculturalism became an issue; he thought of philosophy as
literature before it became a theme in American and European scholarly
circles; and he managed to naturalize Platonism, update Aristotle,
fight off idealisms, and provide a striking and sensitive account of
the spiritual life without being a religious believer. His Hispanic
heritage, shaded by his sense of being an outsider in America, captures
many qualities of American life missed by insiders, and presents views
equal to Tocqueville in quality and importance. Beyond philosophy, only
Emerson may match his literary production. As a public figure, he
appeared on the front cover of Time (3 February 1936), and his
autobiography (Persons and Places, 1944) and only novel
(The Last Puritan, 1936) were the best-selling books in the
United States as Book-of-the-Month Club selections. The novel was
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and Edmund Wilson ranked Persons
and Places among the few first-rate autobiographies, comparing it
favorably to Yeats's memoirs, The Education of Henry Adams,
and Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Remarkably, Santayana
achieved this stature in American thought without being an American
citizen. He proudly retained his Spanish citizenship throughout his
life. Yet, as he readily admitted, it is as an American that his
philosophical and literary corpuses are to be judged. Using

Jean-Paul Sartre,0.5480266213417053,0.5204635858535767,"


Sartre (1905–1980) is arguably the best known philosopher of the
twentieth century. His indefatigable pursuit of philosophical
reflection, literary creativity and, in the second half of his life,
active political commitment gained him worldwide renown, if not
admiration. He is commonly considered the father of Existentialist
philosophy, whose writings set the tone for intellectual life in the
decade immediately following the Second World War. Among the many
ironies that permeate his life, not the least is the immense popularity
of his scandalous public lecture “Existentialism is a Humanism,”
delivered to an enthusiastic Parisian crowd October 28, 1945. Though
taken as a quasi manifesto for the Existentialist movement, the
transcript of this lecture was the only publication that Sartre openly
regretted seeing in print. And yet it continues to be the major
introduction to his philosophy for the general public. One of the
reasons both for its popularity and for his discomfort is the clarity
with which it exhibits the major tenets of existentialist thought while
revealing Sartre's attempt to broaden its social application in
response to his Communist and Catholic critics. In other words, it
offers us a glimpse of Sartre's thought “on the wing.”


After surveying the evolution of Sartre's philosophical thinking, I
shall address his thought under five categories, namely, ontology,
psychology, ethics, political commitment, and the relation between
philosophy and the fine arts, especially literature, in his work. I
shall conclude with several observations about the continued relevance
of his thought in contemporary philosophy both Anglo-American and

areas of philosophy and established himself as perhaps the most
creative of the early phenomenologists. Relative to the attention his
work received and the attention his contemporaries now enjoy, interest
in Scheler's work and thought has waned considerably. This decrease in
attention is in part due to the suppression of Scheler's work by the
Nazis from 1933 to 1945, a suppression stemming from his Jewish heritage

Nevertheless, his work has survived and continues to be read and

Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling (1775–1854) is, along
with J.G. Fichte and G.W.F. Hegel, one of the three most influential
thinkers in the tradition of ‘German Idealism’. Although
he is often regarded as a philosophical Proteus who changed his
conception so radically and so often that it is hard to attribute one
clear philosophical conception to him, Schelling was in fact often an
impressively rigorous logical thinker. In the era during which
Schelling was writing, so much was changing in philosophy that a
stable, fixed point of view was as likely to lead to a failure to
grasp important new developments as it was to lead to a defensible
philosophical system. Schelling's continuing importance today relates
mainly to three aspects of his work. The first is his
Naturphilosophie, which, although its empirical claims are
largely indefensible, opens up the possibility of a modern hermeneutic
view of nature that does not restrict nature's significance to what
can be established about it in scientific terms. The second is his
anti-Cartesian account of subjectivity, which prefigures some of the
most influential ideas of thinkers like Nietzsche, Heidegger, and
Jacques Lacan, in showing how the thinking subject cannot be fully
transparent to itself. The third is his later critique of Hegelian
Idealism, which influenced Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, Heidegger,
and others, and aspects of which are echoed by thinkers like T.W.
Adorno and Jacques Derrida.

Johann Christoph Friedrich Schiller (1759–1805) is best known
for his immense influence on German literature. In his relatively
short life, he authored an extraordinary series of dramas, including
The Robbers, Maria Stuart, and the trilogy
Wallenstein. He was also a prodigious poet, composing perhaps
most famously the “Ode to Joy” featured in the culmination
of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and enshrined, some two centuries
later, in the European
 Hymn.[1]
 In part through his celebrated friendship with Goethe, he edited
epoch-defining literary journals and exerted lasting influence on
German stage production. He is sometimes referred to as the German
Shakespeare; his are still among the most widely produced German plays
both in Germany and internationally.

In addition to his literary accomplishments, Schiller was a formidable
philosophical thinker. Between 1791 and 1796, he authored a range of
theoretical works that are both sophisticated and original. These
writings primarily concern aesthetics, but they stake out notable
positions on ethics, metaphysics, ontology, and political theory as
well. Together, his essays helped shape one of the most prolific
periods of German philosophizing; since then, they have served as a

philosophical memory by his role as the nominal leader of the Vienna
Circle of Logical Positivists, his most lasting contribution includes

reputation was established well before the Circle went public. In

philosophical introduction to the new physics of Relativity which was
highly acclaimed by Einstein himself as well as many others. The
following year, the first edition of his influential General
Theory of Knowledge appeared and, in 1922, he was appointed to
the prestigious chair of Naturphilosophie at the University
of Vienna. Upon his arrival at his new post, he immediately began to
collaborate with the mathematician Hans Hahn, the sociologist and
economist Otto Neurath, forming a discussion group known as the
‘Schlick Zirkel’. In the 1930s, the intellectual
energy of the Circle was increased by newcomers like Rudolf Carnap and
Kurt Gödel, as well as the outside influences of thinkers from
America (Ernest Nagel, W. V. O. Quine), Britain (A. J.  Ayer), Poland

School of Names,0.6285871863365173,0.9260272979736328,"


The “School of Names” (ming jia) is the
traditional Chinese label for a diverse group of Warring States
(479–221 B.C.E.) thinkers who shared an interest in language,
disputation, and metaphysics. They were notorious for logic-chopping,
purportedly idle conceptual puzzles, and paradoxes such as
“Today go to Yue but arrive yesterday” and “A white
horse is not a horse.” Because reflection on language in ancient
China centered on “names” (ming, words) and their
relation to “stuff” (shi, objects, events,
situations), 2nd-century B.C.E. Han dynasty archivists dubbed these
thinkers the “School of Names,” one of six recognized
philosophical movements. The “school” is a taxonomical
fiction, however. The varied figures assigned to it—Deng Xi, Yin
Wen, Hui Shi, and Gongsun Long, among others—never formed a
distinct circle or movement devoted to any particular doctrine or way
of life, and their intellectual interests overlapped extensively with
those of the later Mohists,
 Zhuangzi, 
 and Xunzi. Several of these men were active
politically: Hui Shi was a government minister, Yin Wen and Gongsun
Long political advisors and peace activists. Still, in the eyes of Han
historians, they devoted themselves to no signature ethical or
political doctrines. Hence they became known primarily for their
interest in language and disputation and on that basis were deemed a
“school.” 
 

Before the Han dynasty, the social group of which these thinkers were
a part was known as the bian
zhe—“disputers” or
“dialecticians”—because they spent much of their
time in “disputation” (bian, also
“discrimination” or “distinction drawing”), a
form of dialectical persuasion and inquiry aimed fundamentally at
“distinguishing” the proper semantic relations between
names and the things or kinds of things to which they
refer. “Disputers” is thus probably a more appropriate
English label for Hui Shi, Gongsun Long, and the others than is the
“School of Names,” though it refers not specifically to
these figures but to the broader class of scholars to which they
belonged. (“Name-distinguishers” or
“distinction-disputers” would be even more accurate,
though these terms are too clumsy to adopt as English equivalents.)
The disputers flourished for about a century and a half as wandering
political advisors, counseling rulers throughout pre-unification
China. They disappeared with the onset of the Qin dynasty (221 B.C.E.),
partly because the political and intellectual climate of the new
empire was hostile to their purely theoretical, occasionally flippant
inquiries, and partly because with unification their political
services became obsolete.

Arthur Schopenhauer,0.5998980402946472,0.4788637459278106,"

Arthur Schopenhauer was among the first 19th century
philosophers to contend that at its core, the universe is not a
rational place. Inspired by Plato and Kant, both of whom regarded the
world as being more amenable to reason, Schopenhauer developed their
philosophies into an instinct-recognizing and ultimately ascetic
outlook, emphasizing that in the face of a world filled with endless
strife, we ought to minimize our natural desires for the sake of
achieving a more tranquil frame of mind and a disposition towards
universal beneficence. Often considered to be a thoroughgoing
pessimist, Schopenhauer in fact advocated ways — via artistic,
moral and ascetic forms of awareness — to overcome a
frustration-filled and fundamentally painful human condition. Since
his death in 1860, his philosophy has had a special attraction for
those who wonder about life’s meaning, along with those engaged
in music, literature, and the visual arts.

Alfred Schutz,0.7002155184745789,0.4340460896492005,"


Alfred Schutz, more than any other phenomenologist, attempted to relate
the thought of Edmund Husserl to the social world and the social
sciences. His Phenomenology of the Social World supplied
philosophical foundations for Max Weber’s sociology and for economics,
with which he was familiar through contacts with colleagues of the
Austrian school. When Schutz fled Hitler’s Anschluss of
Austria and immigrated to the United States in 1939, he developed his
thought further in relationship to the social sciences, American
pragmatism, logical empiricism, and to various other fields of endeavor
such as music and literature. His work has been influential on new
movements in sociological thought such as ethnomethodology and
conversation analysis.

Theory and Observation in Science,0.9101824760437012,0.5351534485816956,"

Scientists obtain a great deal of the evidence they use by observing
natural and experimentally generated objects and effects. Much of the
standard philosophical literature on this subject comes from
20th century logical empiricists, their followers, and
critics who embraced their issues and accepted some of their
assumptions even as they objected to specific views. Their discussions
of observational evidence tend to focus on epistemological questions
about its role in theory testing. This entry follows their lead even
though observational evidence also plays important and philosophically
interesting roles in other areas including scientific discovery, the
development of experimental tools and techniques, and the application
of scientific theories to practical problems.

The issues that get the most attention in the standard philosophical
literature on observation and theory have to do with the distinction
between observables and unobservables, the form and content of
observation reports, and the epistemic bearing of observational
evidence on theories it is used to evaluate. This entry discusses
these topics under the following headings:

The Unity of Science,0.9157209992408752,0.5072921514511108,"


The topic of unity in the sciences can be explored through the
following questions: Is there one privileged, most basic or
fundamental concept or kind of thing, and if not, how are the
different concepts or kinds of things in the universe related? Can the
various natural sciences (e.g.,physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology)
be unified into a single overarching theory, and can theories within a
single science (e.g., general relativity and quantum theory in
physics, or models of evolution and development in biology) be
unified? Are theories or models the relevant connected units? What
other connected or connecting units are there? Does the unification of
these parts of science involve only matters of fact or are matters of
value involved as well? What about matters of method, material,
institutional, ethical and other aspects of intellectual cooperation?
Moreover, what kinds of unity, not just units, in the sciences are
there? And is the relation of unification one of reduction,
translation, explanation, logical inference, collaboration or
something else? What roles can unification play in scientific
practices, their development, application and evaluation?

Scientific Discovery,0.8762291669845581,0.5129139423370361,"


Scientific discovery is the process or product of successful
scientific inquiry. Objects of discovery can be things, events,
processes, causes, and properties as well as theories and hypotheses
and their features (their explanatory power, for example). Most
philosophical discussions of scientific discoveries focus on the
generation of new hypotheses that fit or explain given data sets or
allow for the derivation of testable consequences. Philosophical
discussions of scientific discovery have been intricate and complex
because the term “discovery” has been used in many
different ways, both to refer to the outcome and to the procedure of
inquiry. In the narrowest sense, the term “discovery”
refers to the purported “eureka moment” of having a new
insight. In the broadest sense, “discovery” is a synonym
for “successful scientific endeavor” tout court. Some
philosophical disputes about the nature of scientific discovery
reflect these terminological variations.


Philosophical issues related to scientific discovery arise about the
nature of human creativity, specifically about whether the
“eureka moment” can be analyzed and about whether there
are rules (algorithms, guidelines, or heuristics) according to which
such a novel insight can be brought about. Philosophical issues also
arise about rational heuristics, about the characteristics of
hypotheses worthy of articulation and testing, and, on the meta-level,
about the nature and scope of philosophical reflection itself. This
essay describes the emergence and development of the philosophical
problem of scientific discovery, surveys different philosophical
approaches to understanding scientific discovery, and presents the
meta-philosophical problems surrounding the debates.

The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge,0.8758611679077148,0.5315540432929993,"


Study of the social dimensions of scientific knowledge encompasses the
effects of scientific research on human life and social relations, the
effects of social relations and values on scientific research, and the
social aspects of inquiry itself. Several factors have combined to
make these questions salient to contemporary philosophy of science.
These factors include the emergence of social movements, like
environmentalism and feminism, critical of mainstream science;
concerns about the social effects of science-based technologies;
epistemological questions made salient by big science; new trends in
the history of science, especially the move away from internalist
historiography; anti-normative approaches in the sociology of science;
turns in philosophy to naturalism and pragmatism. This entry reviews
the historical background to current research in this area and
features of contemporary science that invite philosophical attention.
The philosophical work can roughly be classified into two camps.  One
acknowledges that scientific inquiry is in fact carried out in social
settings and asks whether and how standard epistemology must be
supplemented to address this feature.  The other treats sociality as a
fundamental aspect of knowledge and asks how standard epistemology
must be modified from this broadly social perspective.  Concerns in
the supplementing approach include such matters as trust and
answerability raised by multiple authorship, the division of cognitive
labor, the reliability of peer review, the challenges of privately
funded science, as well as concerns arising from the role of
scientific research in society.  The reformist approach highlights the
challenge to normative philosophy from social, cultural, and feminist
studies of science while seeking to develop philosophical models of
the social character of scientific knowledge, and treats the questions
of the division of cognitive labor, expertise and authority, the
interactions of science and society, etc., from the perspective of
philosophical models of the irreducibly social character of scientific
knowledge.

Scientific Method,0.8760141134262085,0.5203109383583069,"
Science is an enormously successful human enterprise. The study of
scientific method is the attempt to discern the activities by which
that success is achieved. Among the activities often identified as
characteristic of science are systematic observation and
experimentation, inductive and deductive reasoning, and the formation
and testing of hypotheses and theories. How these are
carried out in detail can vary greatly, but characteristics like these
have been looked to as a way of demarcating scientific activity from
non-science, where only enterprises which employ some canonical form
of scientific method or methods should be considered science (see also
the entry on
science and pseudo-science).  
On the other hand, more recent debate has questioned whether there is
anything like a fixed toolkit of methods which is common across
science and only science.
Scientific method should be distinguished from the aims and
products of science, such as knowledge, predictions, or
control. Methods are the means by which those goals are
achieved. Scientific method should also be distinguished from
meta-methodology, which includes the values and justifications behind
a particular characterization
of scientific method (i.e., a methodology) —
values such as objectivity, reproducibility, simplicity,
or past successes. Methodological rules are proposed to govern method
and it is a meta-methodological question whether methods obeying those
rules satisfy given values.  Finally, method is distinct, to some degree, from
the detailed and contextual practices through which methods are
implemented. The latter might range over: specific laboratory
techniques; mathematical formalisms or other specialized languages
used in descriptions and reasoning; technological or other material
means; ways of communicating and sharing results, whether with other
scientists or with the public at large; or the conventions, habits,
enforced customs, and institutional controls over how and what science
is carried out.
While it is important to recognize these distinctions, their
boundaries are fuzzy. Hence, accounts of method cannot be entirely
divorced from their methodological and meta-methodological motivations
or justifications, Moreover, each aspect plays a crucial role in
identifying methods. Disputes about method have therefore played out
at the detail, rule, and meta-rule levels. Changes in beliefs about
the certainty or fallibility of scientific knowledge, for instance
(which is a meta-methodological consideration of what we can hope for
methods to deliver), have meant different emphases on deductive and
inductive reasoning, or on the relative importance attached to
reasoning over observation (i.e., differences over particular
methods.) Beliefs about the role of science in society will affect the
place one gives to values in scientific method. 
The issue which has shaped debates over scientific method the most in
the last half century is the question of how pluralist do we need to be
about method? Unificationists continue to hold out for one method
essential to science; nihilism is a form of radical pluralism, which
considers the effectiveness of any methodological prescription to be
so context sensitive as to render it not explanatory on its own. Some
middle degree of pluralism regarding the methods embodied in
scientific practice seems appropriate. But the details of scientific
practice vary with time and place, from institution to
institution, across scientists and their subjects of
investigation. How significant are the variations for understanding
science and its success? How much can method be abstracted from
practice? This entry describes some of the attempts to
characterize scientific method or methods, as well as arguments for a more
context-sensitive approach to methods embedded in actual scientific
practices.

Scientific Progress,0.8707261681556702,0.5463144183158875,"

 Science is often distinguished from other domains of human culture by
its progressive nature: in contrast to art, religion, philosophy,
morality, and politics, there exist clear standards or normative
criteria for identifying improvements and advances in science. For
example, the historian of science George Sarton argued that “the
acquisition and systematization of positive knowledge are the only
human activities which are truly cumulative and progressive,” and
“progress has no definite and unquestionable meaning in other fields
than the field of science” (Sarton 1936). However, the traditional
cumulative view of scientific knowledge was effectively challenged by
many philosophers of science in the 1960s and the 1970s, and thereby
the notion of progress was also questioned in the field of
science. Debates on the normative concept of progress are at the same
time concerned with axiological questions about the aims and goals of
science. The task of philosophical analysis is to consider alternative
answers to the question: What is meant by progress in science? This
conceptual question can then be complemented by the methodological
question: How can we recognize progressive developments in science?
Relative to a definition of progress and an account of its best
indicators, one may then study the factual question: To what extent,
and in which respects, is science progressive?

Scientific Revolutions,0.8960660696029663,0.5108568668365479,"

The topic of scientific revolutions has been philosophically important
since Thomas Kuhn’s account in The Structure of Scientific
Revolutions (1962, 1970). Kuhn’s death in 1996 and the
fiftieth anniversary of Structure in 2012 have renewed
attention to the issues raised by his work. It is controversial
whether or not there have been any revolutions in the strictly Kuhnian
sense. It is also controversial what exactly a Kuhnian revolution is,
or would be. Although talk of revolution is often exaggerated, most
analysts agree that there have been transformative scientific
developments of various kinds, whether Kuhnian or not. However, there
is considerable disagreement about their import. The existence and
nature of scientific revolutions is a topic that raises a host of
fundamental questions about the sciences and how to interpret them, a
topic that intersects most of the major issues that have concerned
philosophers of science and their colleagues in neighboring science
and technology studies disciplines. Even if the so-called Scientific
Revolution from Copernicus to Newton fits the attractive,
Enlightenment picture of the transition from feudalism to modernity (a
claim that is also contested), the putative revolutions in mature
sciences (e.g., relativity and quantum mechanics) challenge this
Enlightenment vision of permanent rational and methodological
standards underlying objective sciences and technologies that lead
society along the path of progress toward the truth about the world.
Today’s scientific realists are the most visible heirs of this
picture. Although many philosophers and philosophically or
historically reflective scientists had commented on the dramatic
developments in twentieth-century physics, it was not until Kuhn that
such developments seemed so epistemologically and ontologically
damaging as to seriously challenge traditional conceptions of
science—and hence our understanding of knowledge acquisition
generally. Why it was Kuhn’s work and its timing that made the
major difference are themselves interesting questions for
investigation, given that others (e.g., Wittgenstein, Fleck,
Bachelard, Polanyi, Toulmin, and Hanson) had already broached
important “Kuhnian” themes.

Was there a Scientific Revolution that replaced pre-scientific
thinking about nature and society and thus marked the transition to
modernity? Which later developments, if any, are truly revolutionary?
Are attributions of revolution usually a sign of insufficient
historiographical understanding? In any case, how are such episodes to
be explained historically and epistemologically? Are they contingent,
that is, historical accidents and thus perhaps avoidable; or are they
somehow necessary to a “progressive” science? And, if so,
why? Is there an overall pattern of scientific development? If so, is
it basically one of creative displacement, as Kuhn claimed? Do all
revolutions have the same structure and function, or are there diverse
forms of rupture, discontinuity, or rapid change in science? Do they
represent great leaps forward or, on the contrary, does their
existence undercut the claim that science progresses? Does the
existence of revolutions in mature sciences support a postmodern or
“post-critical” (Polanyi) rather than a modern,
neo-Enlightenment conception of science in relation to other human
enterprises? Does their existence support a strongly constructionist
versus a realist conception of scientific knowledge claims? Are
revolutions an exercise in rationality or are they so excessive as to
be labeled irrational? Do they invite epistemological relativism? What
are the implications of revolution for science policy? This entry will
survey some but not all of these issues.

The Structure of Scientific Theories,0.908055305480957,0.5608823895454407,"


Scientific inquiry has led to immense explanatory and technological
successes, partly as a result of the pervasiveness of scientific
theories. Relativity theory, evolutionary theory, and plate
tectonics were, and continue to be, wildly successful families of
theories within physics, biology, and geology. Other powerful
theory clusters inhabit comparatively recent disciplines such as
cognitive science, climate science, molecular biology, microeconomics,
and Geographic Information Science (GIS). Effective scientific
theories magnify understanding, help supply legitimate explanations,
and assist in formulating predictions. Moving from their
knowledge-producing representational functions to their interventional
roles (Hacking 1983), theories are integral to building technologies
used within consumer, industrial, and scientific milieus.


This entry explores the structure of scientific theories from the
perspective of the Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic Views. Each of
these answers questions such as the following in unique ways. What is
the best characterization of the composition and function of
scientific theory? How is theory linked with world? Which
philosophical tools can and should be employed in describing and
reconstructing scientific theory? Is an understanding of practice and
application necessary for a comprehension of the core structure of a
scientific theory? Finally, and most generally, how are these three
views ultimately related?

Underdetermination of Scientific Theory,0.8868463039398193,0.5614755749702454,"

At the heart of the underdetermination of scientific theory by
evidence is the simple idea that the evidence available to us at a
given time may be insufficient to determine what beliefs we should
hold in response to it. In a textbook example, if all I know is that
you spent $10 on apples and oranges and that apples cost $1 while
oranges cost $2, then I know that you did not buy six oranges, but I
do not know whether you bought one orange and eight apples, two
oranges and six apples, and so on. A simple scientific example can be
found in the rationale behind the sensible methodological adage that
“correlation does not imply causation”. If watching lots
of cartoons causes children to be more violent in their playground
behavior, then we should (barring complications) expect to find a
correlation between levels of cartoon viewing and violent playground
behavior. But that is also what we would expect to find if
children who are prone to violence tend to enjoy and seek out cartoons
more than other children, or if propensities to violence and increased
cartoon viewing are both caused by some third factor (like general
parental neglect or excessive consumption of Twinkies). So a high
correlation between cartoon viewing and violent playground behavior is
evidence that (by itself) simply underdetermines what we
should believe about the causal relationship between the two. But it
turns out that this simple and familiar predicament only scratches the
surface of the various ways in which problems of underdetermination
can arise in the course of scientific investigation.

Madeleine de Scudéry,0.5837403535842896,0.673664927482605,"

A prominent novelist, Madeleine de Scudéry (1607–1701)
composed a series of dialogues dealing with philosophical issues.
Primarily ethical in focus, her dialogues examine the virtues and
vices proper to the aristocratic society of the period. They also
explore questions of moral psychology, in particular the interplay
between temperament and free will. In the area of epistemology,
Scudéry analyzes the problem of certitude and self-knowledge.
Theologically, she defends cosmological arguments demonstrating
God’s existence. Her aesthetic theory endorses the mimetic
thesis concerning art as the imitation of nature but the individuality
of artistic perception also receives attention. In her philosophical
speculation, Scudéry stresses questions of gender; the
relationship of philosophical theories to the condition of women
receives substantial analysis.

Long framed by her critics as a pedantic précieuse,
Scudéry has only recently attracted the interest of
professional philosophers. Critics have dismissed her lengthy novels
as unreadable, her famous Saturday salon as amateurish, and her
philosophical ideas as derivative and confused. In the recent feminist
expansion of the canon of humanities, however, another Scudéry
has appeared. In this reevaluation, the philosophical significance of
her writings has emerged. Her literary corpus presents a novel version
of the ancient philosophical method of dialogue; it also expresses
original, sophisticated theories concerning the ethical, aesthetic,
and theological disputes of early modernity.

Secession,0.4144695401191712,0.6930395364761353,"

Until fairly recently secession has been a neglected topic among
philosophers. Two factors may explain why philosophers have now begun
to turn their attention to secession. First, in the past two decades
there has been a great increase not only in the number of attempted
secessions, but also in successful secessions, and philosophers may
simply be reacting to this new reality, attempting to make normative
sense of it. The reasons for the frequency of attempts to secede are
complex, but there are two recent developments that make the prospect
of state-breaking more promising: improvement in national security and
liberalization of trade. As the fear of forcible annexation diminishes
and trade barriers fall, smaller states become feasible, and
independent statehood looks more feasible for regions within states.
Second, in roughly the same time period, the idea that there is a
strong case for some form of self-government for groups presently
contained within states has gained ground. Once one begins to take
seriously the case for special group rights for
minorities—especially if these include rights of
self-government—it is difficult to avoid the question of whether
some such groups may be entitled to full independence.

Self-Consciousness,0.716715931892395,0.4391235709190369,"

Human beings are conscious not only of the world around them but also
of themselves: their activities, their bodies, and their mental lives.
They are, that is, self-conscious (or, equivalently, self-aware).
Self-consciousness can be understood as an awareness of oneself. But a
self-conscious subject is not just aware of something that merely
happens to be themselves, as one is if one sees an old photograph
without realising that it is of oneself. Rather a self-conscious
subject is aware of themselves as themselves; it is manifest
to them that they themselves are the object of awareness.
Self-consciousness is a form of consciousness that is paradigmatically
expressed in English by the words “I”, “me”,
and “my”, terms that each of us uses to refer to ourselves
as such.

A central topic throughout the history of philosophy—and
increasingly so since the seventeenth century—the phenomena
surrounding self-consciousness prompt a variety of fundamental
philosophical and scientific questions, including its relation to
consciousness; its semantic and epistemic features; its realisation in
both conceptual and non-conceptual representation; and its connection
to our conception of an objective world populated with others like
ourselves.

On the phenomenological view, a minimal form of self-consciousness is
a constant structural feature of conscious experience. Experience
happens for the experiencing subject in an immediate way and as part
of this immediacy, it is implicitly marked as my
experience. For phenomenologists, this immediate and
first-personal givenness of experiential phenomena is accounted
for in terms of a pre-reflective self-consciousness. In the most basic
sense of the term, self-consciousness is not something that comes
about the moment one attentively inspects or reflectively introspects
one's experiences, or recognizes one's specular image in the mirror, or refers to oneself with the use of the first-person pronoun, or constructs a self-narrative. Rather, these different
kinds of self-consciousness are to be distinguished from the
pre-reflective self-consciousness which is present whenever I am
living through or undergoing an experience, i.e., whenever I am
consciously perceiving the world, whenever I am thinking an occurrent
thought, whenever I am feeling sad or happy, thirsty or in pain, and
so forth.

Self-Reference,0.8525557518005371,0.7531983852386475,"


In the context of language, self-reference is used to denote
a statement that refers to itself or its own referent. The most famous
example of a self-referential sentence is the liar sentence:
“This sentence is not true.” Self-reference is often used
in a broader context as well. For instance, a picture could be
considered self-referential if it contains a copy of itself (see the
animated image above); and a piece of literature could be considered
self-referential if it includes a reference to the work itself. In
philosophy, self-reference is primarily studied in the context of
language. Self-reference within language is not only a subject of
philosophy, but also a field of individual interest in mathematics and
computer science, in particular in relation to the foundations of
these sciences.

The philosophical interest in self-reference is to a large extent
centered around the paradoxes. A paradox is a seemingly sound
piece of reasoning based on apparently true assumptions that leads to
a contradiction. The liar sentence considered above leads to a
contradiction when we try to determine whether it is true or not. If
we assume the sentence to be true, then what it states must be the
case, that is, it cannot be true. If, on the other hand, we assume it
not to be true, then what it states is actually the case, and thus it
must be true. In either case we are led to a contradiction. Since the
contradiction was obtained by a seemingly sound piece of reasoning
based on apparently true assumptions, it qualifies as a paradox. It is
known as the liar paradox. 

Most paradoxes of self-reference may be categorised as either
semantic, set-theoretic or epistemic. The
semantic paradoxes, like the liar paradox, are primarily relevant to
theories of truth. The set-theoretic paradoxes are relevant to the
foundations of mathematics, and the epistemic paradoxes are relevant
to epistemology. Even though these paradoxes are different in the
subject matter they relate to, they share the same underlying
structure, and may often be tackled using the same mathematical means.


In the present entry, we will first introduce a number of the most
well-known paradoxes of self-reference, and discuss their common
underlying structure. Subsequently, we will discuss the profound
consequences that these paradoxes have on a number of different areas:
theories of truth, set theory, epistemology, foundations of
mathematics, computability. Finally, we will present the most
prominent approaches to solving the paradoxes.

editorial work as a co-founder of the first American journal devoted
to “analytic” philosophy and co-editor of two seminal
collections of essays that defined the canon for generations of
graduate students.  More significantly, he is known for his attack on
the “myth of the given” and his development of a
coherentist epistemology and functional role/inferentialist semantics,
for his distinction between the “manifest image” and the
“scientific image” of the world, for his proposal that
psychological concepts are like theoretical concepts, and for a
tough-minded scientific realism.  Sellars can claim the first explicit
formulation of a functionalist treatment of intentional states, an
early recognition of the “hard problem” of sensory
consciousness, and a thoroughgoing nominalism, as well as rich
interpretations of historical figures in philosophy. His work has
inspired a number of contemporary philosophers, although they tend to
fall into at least two camps, sometimes denominated
“right-wing” and “left-wing” Sellarsians.

Montague Semantics,0.7881143093109131,0.6978068947792053,"

Montague semantics is a theory of natural language semantics and of
its relation with syntax. It was originally developed by the logician
Richard Montague (1930–1971) and subsequently modified and
extended by linguists, philosophers, and logicians. The most important
features of the theory are its use of model theoretic semantics which
is nowadays commonly used for the semantics of logical languages and
its adherence to the principle of compositionality—that is, the
meaning of the whole is a function of the meanings of its parts and
their mode of syntactic combination. This entry presents the origins
of Montague Semantics, summarizes important aspects of the classical
theory, and sketches more recent developments. We conclude with a
small example, which illustrates some modern features.

Proof-Theoretic Semantics,0.8862107992172241,0.786782443523407,"


Proof-theoretic semantics is an alternative to truth-condition
semantics. It is based on the fundamental assumption that the central
notion in terms of which meanings are assigned to certain expressions
of our language, in particular to logical constants, is that of
proof rather than truth. In this sense
proof-theoretic semantics is semantics in terms of proof .
Proof-theoretic semantics also means the semantics of proofs,
i.e., the semantics of entities which describe how we arrive at certain
assertions given certain assumptions. Both aspects of proof-theoretic
semantics can be intertwined, i.e. the semantics of proofs is itself
often given in terms of proofs.


Proof-theoretic semantics has several roots, the most specific one
being Gentzen’s remarks that the introduction rules in his
calculus of natural deduction define the meanings of logical constants,
while the elimination rules can be obtained as a consequence of this
definition (see section
 2.2.1).
 More
broadly, it belongs to what Prawitz called general proof
theory (see section
 1.1).
 Even more
broadly, it is part of the tradition according to which the meaning of
a term should be explained by reference to the way it is used
in our language.


Within philosophy, proof-theoretic semantics has mostly figured
under the heading “theory of meaning”. This terminology
follows Dummett, who claimed that the theory of meaning is the basis of
theoretical philosophy, a view which he attributed to Frege. The term
“proof-theoretic semantics” was proposed by
Schroeder-Heister (1991; used already in 1987 lectures in Stockholm) in order not to leave the term
“semantics” to denotationalism alone—after all,
“semantics” is the standard term for investigations dealing
with the meaning of linguistic expressions. Furthermore, unlike
“theory of meaning”, the term “proof-theoretic
semantics” covers philosophical and technical aspects likewise.
In 1999, the first conference with this title took place in
Tübingen, the second one in 2013. The first textbook with this title appeared in 2015.

Two-Dimensional Semantics,0.791050374507904,0.6406984329223633,"
 
Two-dimensional (2D) semantics is a formal framework that is used to
characterize the meaning of certain linguistic expressions and the
entailment relations among sentences containing them. Two-dimensional
semantics has also been applied to thought contents. In contrast with
standard possible worlds semantics, 2D semantics assigns extensions
and truth-values to expressions relative to two possible world
parameters, rather than just one. So a 2D semantic framework provides
finer-grained semantic values than those available within standard
possible world semantics, while using the same basic model-theoretic
resources. The 2D framework itself is just a formal tool. To develop a
semantic theory for someone’s language, a proponent of 2D semantics
must do three things: (i) explain what exactly the two possible world
parameters represent, (ii) explain the rules for assigning 2D semantic
values to a person’s words and sentences, and (iii) explain how 2D
semantic values help in understanding the meanings of the person’s
words and sentences.

The two-dimensional framework has been interpreted in different ways
for different explanatory purposes. The two most widely accepted
applications of two-dimensional semantics target restricted classes of
expressions. David Kaplan’s 2D semantic framework for indexicals is
widely used to explain conventional semantic rules governing
context-dependent expressions like ‘I’,
‘that’, or ‘here’, which pick out different
things depending on the context in which the expression is used. And
logicians working on tense and modal logic use 2D semantics to
characterize the logical implications of operators like
‘now’, ‘actually’, and
‘necessarily’. Such restricted applications of 2D
semantics are intended to systematize and explain uncontroversial
aspects of linguistic understanding.

Two-dimensional semantics has also been used for more ambitious
philosophical purposes. Influential theorists like David Lewis, Frank
Jackson and David Chalmers argue that a generalized 2D semantic
framework can be used to isolate an apriori aspect of meaning.
Roughly, the idea is that speakers always have apriori access to the
truth-conditions associated with their own sentences. On the face of
it, this apriority claim seems to conflict with the observation that
certain necessary truths, such as ‘water =
H2O’, can be known only on the basis of empirical
inquiry. But proponents of generalized 2D semantics argue that the 2D
framework undercuts this objection, by showing how such aposteriori
necessities are consistent with apriori access to truth-conditions.
The positive reasons to accept generalized 2D semantics, however, are
bound up with larger (and partly disjoint) explanatory projects. As a
consequence, debates over the merits of generalized 2D semantics touch
on broader controversies about apriority, modality, semantic theory
and philosophical methodology.

The two-dimensional framework can also figure in a theory of ad
hoc language use, instead of a theory of literal meanings. Robert
Stalnaker’s influential 2D account of assertion falls in this
category. His “metasemantic” interpretation of the 2D
framework is intended to characterize what is communicated when
conversational partners are partially ignorant or mistaken about the
literal meaning of their own words. Although it is formally similar to
generalized 2D semantics, Stalnaker’s use of the 2D framework avoids
apriori accessible truth-conditions of the sort posited by generalized
2D semantics.

Readers who are unfamiliar with the 2D framework and want to get an
overall sense of the formalism and its philosophical applications
should read section 1 plus the subsequent “overview”
sections. Those already familiar with the basic 2D framework may skip
section 1 and move directly to sections 2 and 3, which contrast recent
philosophical applications of the framework.

Seneca,0.4825654625892639,0.2454162985086441,"


Seneca is a major philosophical figure of the Roman Imperial Period.
As a Stoic philosopher writing in Latin, Seneca makes a lasting
contribution to Stoicism. He occupies a central place in the literature
on Stoicism at the time, and shapes the understanding of Stoic thought
that later generations were to have. Seneca's philosophical works
played a large role in the revival of Stoic ideas in the Renaissance.
Until today, many readers approach Stoic philosophy through Seneca,
rather than through the more fragmentary evidence that we have for
earlier Stoics. Seneca's writings are stunningly diverse in their
generic range. More than that, Seneca develops further and shapes
several philosophical genres, most important, the letter and so-called
“consolations”; his essay On Mercy is considered
the first example of what came to be known as the “mirror of the
prince” literature.


After several centuries of relative neglect, Seneca's philosophy has
been rediscovered in the last few decades, in what might be called a
second revival of Senecan thought. In part, this renewed interest is
the result of a general reappraisal of Roman culture. It is also
fuelled by major progress that has been made in our understanding of
Greek Hellenistic philosophy, and by recent developments in
contemporary ethics, such as a renewed interest in the theory of
emotions, roles and relationships, and the fellowship of all human
beings. And finally, some influential scholars have found, in the wake
of Foucault's reading of Seneca, that Seneca speaks to some
distinctively modern concerns.

Sense-Data,0.7625080943107605,0.40052330493927,"


Sense data are the alleged mind-dependent objects that we are 
directly aware of in perception, and that have exactly the properties
they appear to have. For instance, sense data theorists say that, 
upon viewing a tomato in normal conditions, one forms an image of the
tomato in one's mind. This image is red and round. The mental image 
is an example of a “sense datum.” Many philosophers have 
rejected the notion of sense data, either because they believe that 
perception gives us direct awareness of physical phenomena, 
rather than mere mental images, or because they believe that the 
mental phenomena involved in perception do not have the 
properties that appear to us (for instance, I might have a visual 
experience representing a red, round tomato, but my experience is not
itself red or round). Defenders of sense data have argued, among 
other things, that sense data are required to explain such phenomena 
as perspectival variation, illusion, and hallucination. Critics of 
sense data have objected to the theory's commitment to mind-body 
dualism, the problems it raises for our knowledge of the external 
world, its difficulty in locating sense data in physical space, and 
its apparent commitment to the existence of objects with 
indeterminate properties.

Set Theory,0.925203800201416,0.7492754459381104,"
Set theory is the mathematical theory of well-determined
collections, called sets, of objects that are called
members, or elements, of the set. Pure set theory
deals exclusively with sets, so the only sets under consideration are
those whose members are also sets. The theory of the
hereditarily-finite sets, namely those finite sets whose
elements are also finite sets, the elements of which are also finite,
and so on, is formally equivalent to arithmetic. So, the essence of
set theory is the study of infinite sets, and therefore it can be
defined as the mathematical theory of the actual—as opposed to
potential—infinite.
The notion of set is so simple that it is usually introduced
informally, and regarded as self-evident. In set theory, however, as
is usual in mathematics, sets are given axiomatically, so their
existence and basic properties are postulated by the appropriate
formal axioms. The axioms of set theory imply the existence of a
set-theoretic universe so rich that all mathematical objects can be
construed as sets. Also, the formal language of pure set theory allows
one to formalize all mathematical notions and arguments. Thus, set theory
has become the standard foundation for mathematics, as every
mathematical object can be viewed as a set, and every theorem of
mathematics can be logically deduced in the Predicate Calculus from
the axioms of set theory.
Both aspects of set theory, namely, as the mathematical science of
the infinite, and as the foundation of mathematics, are of
philosophical importance.

Foundations and related systems, positive set theories, and

theories does not presuppose an interest in replacing the dominant set
theory with one of the alternatives; acquainting ourselves with
foundations of mathematics formulated in terms of an alternative
system can be instructive as showing us what any set theory (including
the usual one) is supposed to do for us. The study of alternative set
theories can dispel a facile identification of “set

Set Theory: Constructive and Intuitionistic ZF,0.9154506921768188,0.7909891605377197,"


Constructive and intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theories
are
 axiomatic theories of sets
 in the
style of
 Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF)
 which are based on
 intuitionistic logic.
 They were introduced in the 1970's and they represent a formal context
 within which to codify mathematics based on intuitionistic logic (see the entry
on
 constructive mathematics).
They are formulated on the standard first order language of 
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and make no direct use of inherently 
constructive ideas. In working in constructive and intuitionistic 
ZF we can thus to some extent rely on our familiarity with ZF and 
its heuristics.


Notwithstanding the similarities with classical set theory, the
concepts of set defined by constructive and
intuitionistic set theories differ considerably from that of
the classical tradition; they also differ from each other. The
techniques utilised to work within them, as well as to obtain
metamathematical results about them, also diverge in some respects
from the classical tradition because of their commitment to
intuitionistic logic.  In fact, as is common in intuitionistic
settings, a plethora of semantic and proof-theoretic methods are
available for the study of constructive and intuitionistic set
theories.


This entry introduces the main features of constructive and intuitionistic set theories.  As the field is expanding at a fast 
pace, we can only briefly recall some key aspects of
the known results and available techniques. We shall focus more on
constructive set theory, as we should like to highlight important
foundational issues that arise within it.
Note that we shall omit a conspicuous part of the literature 
on constructive and intuitionistic ZF which relates to their categorical 
interpretations. This area has seen major developments over the years, so much 
so that an adequate treatment of that progress would require a 
substantial extension of this entry.

Independence and Large Cardinals,0.9328959584236144,0.738395094871521,"


The independence results in arithmetic and set theory led to
a proliferation of mathematical systems.  One very general way to
investigate the space of possible mathematical systems is under the
relation of interpretability.  Under this relation the space of
possible mathematical systems forms an intricate hierarchy of
increasingly strong systems.  Large cardinal axioms provide a
canonical means of climbing this hierarchy and they play a central role
in comparing systems from conceptually distinct domains.


This article is an introduction to independence, interpretability,
large cardinals and their interrelations.  Section 1 surveys the
classic independence results in arithmetic and set theory.  Section 2
introduces the interpretability hierarchy and describes some of its
basic features.  Section 3 introduces the notion of a large cardinal
axiom and discusses some of the central examples.  Section 4 brings
together the previous themes by discussing the manner in which large
cardinal axioms provide a canonical means for climbing the hierarchy
of interpretability and serve as an intermediary in the comparison of
systems from conceptually distinct domains.  Section 5 briefly touches
on some philosophical considerations.

Non-wellfounded Set Theory,0.9234001636505128,0.7691783905029297,"

 This entry is about two kinds of circularity: object
circularity, where an object is taken to be part of itself in
some sense; and definition circularity, where a collection is
defined in terms of itself.  Instances of these two kinds of
circularity are sometimes problematic, and sometimes not.  We are
primarily interested in object circularity in this entry, especially
instances which look problematic when one tries to model them in set
theory.  But we shall also discuss circular definitions.

 The term non-wellfounded set refers to sets which contain
themselves as members, and more generally which are part of an
infinite sequence of sets each term of which is an element of the
preceding set.  So they exhibit object circularity in a blatant way.
Discussion of such sets is very old in the history of set theory, but
non-wellfounded sets are ruled out of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (the
standard theory) due to the Foundation Axiom (FA).  As it happens,
there are alternatives to this axiom FA.  This entry is especially
concerned with one of them, an axiom first formulated by Marco Forti
and Furio Honsell in a 1983 paper.  It is now standard to call this principle the
Anti-Foundation Axiom (AFA), following its treatment in an
influential book written by Peter Aczel in 1988.

 The attraction of using AFA is that it gives a set of tools for
modeling circular phenomena of various sorts.  These tools are
connected to important circular definitions, as we shall see.  We
shall also be concerned with situating both the mathematics and the
underlying intuitions in a broader picture, one derived from work in
coalgebra.
Incorporating concepts and results from category theory,
coalgebra leads us to concepts such as corecursion
and coinduction; these are in a sense duals to the more
standard notions of recursion
and induction.


 The topic of this entry also has connections to work in game theory
(the universal Harsanyi type spaces), semantics (especially
situation-theoretic accounts, or others where a “world” is allowed
to be part of itself), fractals sets and other self-similar sets, the
analysis of recursion, category theory, and the philosophical side of
set theory.

Sex has received little attention in the history of western philosophy, and
what it did receive was not good: Plato denigrated it, arguing that it
should lead to something higher or better (Phaedrus,
Symposium), Aristotle barely mentioned it, and Christian
philosophers condemned it: Augustine argued that its pleasures are
dangerous in mastering us, and allowed sex only for procreation
(City of God, bk 14; On Marriage and Concupiscence),
while Aquinas confined its permissibility to conjugal, procreative
acts (Summa contra gentiles III.2; Summa theologia
IIa-IIae). Immanuel Kant (Lectures on Ethics) considered it
the only inclination that cannot satisfy the Categorical Imperative,
and Jean-Paul Sartre claimed that sexual desire aims to capture the
other’s freedom (1943: pt. III, ch. 3]). The Marquis de Sade (a
philosopher of sorts) went to the opposite extreme, celebrating all
types of sexual acts, including rape (1785; 1791; 1795). Only during
contemporary times do philosophers, beginning with Bertrand Russell
(1929) and including Sigmund Freud (1905), think of sex as generally
good (see Soble 2006 and 2008: ch. 2 for a brief yet excellent
chapters on this history; see also Belliotti 1993: Pt. I).

Sex raises fascinating issues. Rooted in our biology, pervaded by our
intentionality, and (normally) directed at other human beings, sexual
desire is complex and not confined to specific mating seasons. Its
pleasures are powerful and have ruined many lives. Men and women seem
to exhibit, desire, and experience sex differently (e.g., men, much
more than women, consume pornography, have sex with prostitutes,
frequent strip clubs, and have fetishes [Buss 2016, esp. chs. 2 and 3;
Laumann et al. 1994, esp. pt. II; Margolis 2004, esp. ch. 1–3;
Symons 1979, esp. chs. 1 and 7]). Why this is so, is debatable (Soble
2008: ch. 10; Wertheimer 2003: ch. 3) but these issues make it crucial
to understand sexual desire, pleasure, activity, and preferences, and
to explore the moral aspects of sex.

Mary Shepherd (1777–1847) is the author of several works
advocating a systematic metaphysics and theory of knowledge which were
highly regarded by her contemporaries. Born and raised a short
distance from Edinburgh and well versed in the intellectual life of
the city, she urges a philosophy adamantly opposed to main tenets of
the Scottish school. She finds them unable to sustain scientific
inquiry, everyday practical reasoning, and belief in an almighty
deity. Her aim is to replace them with a metaphysics consisting of
existential beliefs held for good reasons. An analysis of causality is
primary in her theory. She contends that the relation between cause
and effect is one of efficacy, necessity, and simultaneity. The first
of her two books, Essay upon the Relation of Cause and Effect
(Shepherd 1824; abbreviated ERCE), is chiefly concerned with deriving
and developing this doctrine while pointing to errors in the reasoning
of Hume and his followers on this subject. Her second volume (Shepherd
1827a) has two parts. The first is a long treatise Essay on the
Academical or Skeptical Philosophy (abbreviated EASP) which uses
causal reasoning to explain the origin and justification of
existential beliefs with regard to the external world, ourselves, and
God. The second consists of shorter essays said to be illustrative of
doctrines contained in the first part of this volume and the earlier
one published under her name. Her theory of knowledge is neither
rationalist nor empiricist; it takes all knowledge to unify passively
received sensations with principles drawn from the faculty of reason,
so that knowledge of all sorts is at once felt and represented
discursively. In this respect, her position is more like that of Kant
than like those of her other early modern predecessors. But her
metaphysics and theory of the justification of existential beliefs are
distinctive of her philosophical system. 

Shepherd’s wide social circle included men and women of science,
literary figures and others of intellectual accomplishment, and she
enjoyed discussing metaphysical topics. This may have helped to garner
an audience for her work. Its merits were publicly acknowledged in
several ways. There is good evidence that one of her monographs was
used as a textbook at Cambridge. Her part of a sharp philosophical
dispute was published in a monthly magazine. Her theory of mind and
self are the subject of an entry in Robert Blakey’s multi-volume
History of the Philosophy of Mind (1850). After her death and
before its recent recovery, her philosophy dropped from view for
reasons that are not entirely clear (Atherton 2005; Paoletti 2011).

The Methods of Ethics (1907), was first published in 1874 and
in many ways marked the culmination of the classical utilitarian
tradition—the tradition of Jeremy Bentham and James and John
Stuart Mill—with its emphasis on “the greatest happiness
of the greatest number” as the fundamental normative
demand. Sidgwick's treatment of that position was more comprehensive
and scholarly than any previous one, and he set the agenda for most of
the twentieth-century debates between utilitarians and their critics.
Utilitarians from G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell to J. J. C. Smart
and R. M. Hare down to Derek Parfit and Peter Singer have acknowledged
Sidgwick's Methods as a vital source for their arguments. But
in addition to authoritatively formulating utilitarianism and
inspiring utilitarians, the Methods has also served as a
general model for how to do ethical theory, since it provides a series
of systematic, historically informed comparisons between
utilitarianism and its leading alternatives. Thus, even such
influential critics of utilitarianism as William Frankena, Marcus
Singer, and John Rawls have looked to Sidgwick's work for
guidance. C. D. Broad, a later successor to Sidgwick's Cambridge
chair, famously went so far as to say “Sidgwick's Methods of
Ethics seems to me to be on the whole the best treatise on moral
theory that has ever been written, and to be one of the English
philosophical classics” (Broad, 1930: 143). In recent years,
Broad's assessment has been endorsed by an increasing number of
philosophers (Parfit, 2011, de Lazari-Radek and Singer, 2014, and
Crisp, 2015). Engaging with Sidgwick's work remains an excellent way
to cultivate a serious philosophical interest in ethics, metaethics,
and practical ethics, not to mention the history of these subjects.
Moreover, he made important contributions to many other fields,
including economics, political theory, classics, educational theory,
and parapsychology. His significance as an intellectual and cultural
figure has yet to be fully appreciated, but recent years have
witnessed an impressive expansion of Sidgwick studies, and he has even
been featured in popular novels (Cohen, 2010, Entwistle, 2014).

Simon of Faversham († 1306) was a thirteenth-century scholar,
mainly known as a commentator on Aristotle’s logic and natural
philosophy. He is considered a modist, among other things because of
his use of the notions of modi praedicandi and modi
essendi in his commentary on Aristotle’s
Categories (cf. Marmo 1999). Simon’s work as an
Aristotelian commentator heavily relies on Albert the Great’s
paraphrases on the Aristotelian corpus. Simon’s
question-commentaries often portray key medieval discussions in a
somewhat undeveloped state. But in some issues, such as the discussion
on empty reference, he exhibits good philosophical analysis and
resourcefulness. Simon’s works are also of great historical
interest because they represent an important stage in the development
of thirteenth-century philosophical ideas. His corpus is relatively
unexplored, and although an important part of it is extant, a large
part is also unedited.

Simplicity,0.8609679341316223,0.5245656967163086,"

Most philosophers believe that, other things being equal, simpler
theories are better. But what exactly does theoretical simplicity
amount to? Syntactic simplicity, or elegance, measures the number and
conciseness of the theory's basic principles. Ontological simplicity,
or parsimony, measures the number of kinds of entities postulated by
the theory. One issue concerns how these two forms of simplicity
relate to one another. There is also an issue concerning the
justification of principles, such as Occam's Razor, which favor simple
theories. The history of philosophy has seen many approaches to
defending Occam's Razor, from the theological justifications of the
Early Modern period, to contemporary justifications employing results
from probability theory and statistics.

Computer Simulations in Science,0.8076978325843811,0.38126108050346375,"


Computer simulation was pioneered as a scientific tool in meteorology
and nuclear physics in the period directly following World War II, and
since then has become indispensable in a growing number of
disciplines. The list of sciences that make extensive use of computer
simulation has grown to include astrophysics, particle physics,
materials science, engineering, fluid mechanics, climate science,
evolutionary biology, ecology, economics, decision theory, medicine,
sociology, epidemiology, and many others. There are even a few
disciplines, such as chaos theory and complexity theory, whose very
existence has emerged alongside the development of the computational
models they study.


After a slow start, philosophers of science have begun to devote
more attention to the role of computer simulation in
science. Several areas of philosophical interest in
computer simulation have emerged: What is the structure of the
epistemology of computer simulation? What is the relationship
between computer simulation and experiment? Does computer
simulation raise issues for the philosophy of science that are not
fully covered by recent work on models more generally? What does
computer simulation teach us about emergence? About the structure
of scientific theories? About the role (if any) of fictions in
scientific modeling?

Situations in Natural Language Semantics,0.8198155164718628,0.8865782618522644,"


Situation semantics was developed as an alternative to possible worlds
semantics. In situation semantics, linguistic expressions are
evaluated with respect to partial, rather than complete, worlds. There
is no consensus about what situations are, just as there is no
consensus about what possible worlds or events are. According to some,
situations are structured entities consisting of relations and
individuals standing in those relations. According to others,
situations are particulars. In spite of unresolved foundational
issues, the partiality provided by situation semantics has led to some
genuinely new approaches to a variety of phenomena in natural language
semantics. In the way of illustration, this article includes
relatively detailed overviews of a few selected areas where situation
semantics has been successful: implicit quantifier domain
restrictions, donkey pronouns, and exhaustive interpretations. It
moreover addresses the question of how Davidsonian event semantics can
be embedded in a semantics based on situations. Other areas where a
situation semantics perspective has led to progress include attitude
ascriptions, questions, tense, aspect, nominalizations, implicit
arguments, point of view, counterfactual conditionals, and discourse
relations.

Skepticism About Moral Responsibility,0.5678521990776062,0.7637085914611816,"

Skepticism about moral responsibility, or what is more commonly
referred to as moral responsibility skepticism, refers to a
family of views that all take seriously the possibility that human
beings are never morally responsible for their actions in a particular
but pervasive sense. This sense is typically set apart by the notion
of basic desert and is defined in terms of the control in
action needed for an agent to be truly deserving of blame and
praise. Some moral responsibility skeptics wholly reject this notion
of moral responsibility because they believe it to be incoherent or
impossible. Others maintain that, though possible, our best
philosophical and scientific theories about the world provide strong
and compelling reasons for adopting skepticism about moral
responsibility. What all varieties of moral responsibility skepticism
share, however, is the belief that the justification needed to ground
basic desert moral responsibility and the practices associated with
it—such as backward-looking praise and blame, punishment and
reward (including retributive punishment), and the reactive attitudes
of resentment and indignation—is not met. Versions of moral
responsibility skepticism have historically been defended by Spinoza,
Voltaire, Diderot, d’Holbach, Priestley, Schopenhauer,
Nietzsche, Clarence Darrow, B.F. Skinner, and Paul Edwards, and more
recently by Galen Strawson, Derk Pereboom, Bruce Waller, Neil Levy,
Tamler Sommers, and Gregg D. Caruso. 

Critics of these views tend to focus both on the arguments for
skepticism about moral responsibility and on the implications
of such views. They worry that adopting such a view would have dire
consequences for our interpersonal relationships, society, morality,
meaning, and the law. They fear, for instance, that relinquishing
belief in moral responsibility would undermine morality, leave us
unable to adequately deal with criminal behavior, increase anti-social
conduct, and destroy meaning in life. Optimistic skeptics,
however, respond by arguing that life without free will and basic
desert moral responsibility would not be as destructive as many people
believe. These optimistic skeptics argue that prospects of finding
meaning in life or of sustaining good interpersonal relationships, for
instance, would not be threatened. They further maintain that morality
and moral judgments would remain intact. And although retributivism
and severe punishment, such as the death penalty, would be ruled out,
they argue that the imposition of sanctions could serve purposes other
than the punishment of the guilty—e.g., it can also be justified
by its role in incapacitating, rehabilitating, and deterring
offenders.

Medieval Skepticism,0.6984108090400696,0.2058868557214737,"

Overarching surveys of the history of philosophy often leave the
impression that philosophical skepticism—roughly, the position
that nothing can be known—had many adherents in the Ancient and
Hellenistic Periods, disappeared completely as a topic of intellectual
interest during the Middle Ages, and returned as a viable position in
the Renaissance and Early Modern Periods.

As a survey, this is quite understandable, since no thinker from the
Middle Ages professed an active allegiance to a systematic
philosophical skepticism. But a closer examination of Medieval
Philosophy shows that despite skepticism’s disappearance as an
overt philosophical movement, it continued to swirl in the thoughts of
many of the best philosophers of the period. A very few, including
most prominently Augustine and Al-Ghazali, claimed to have been
systematic skeptics at some points in their pasts. Many others held
skeptical views about localized issues such as one’s ability to
know an efficient cause. And even more discussed and attempted to
refute commonplace skeptical arguments in defense of their own,
anti-skeptical positions.

Chronologically speaking, skeptical issues were most prominently
considered in works from both the leading and tail ends of the Middle
Ages. Augustine’s 4th and 5th century attacks against the
Academic Skeptics mark the beginning of such discussions, and a
smattering of treatments of skeptical issues appears periodically
throughout the next 800 years. From the late 13th century onwards,
however, skeptical issues began to exert a dominant and wide influence
on epistemological discussions, as seen in the works of such important
figures as Henry of Ghent, John Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Peter
Auriol, John Buridan, and Nicholas of Autrecourt.

Though medieval discussions of skepticism are often found buried
within larger, formulaic discussions of theological topics, these
treatments had influence beyond the academic circles within which they
were originally created and considered. Among Early Modern
philosophers, Descartes in particular owes a debt to these earlier
accounts of skepticism: versions of both his cogito and Evil
Demon arguments may be found in the works of medieval
philosophers.

In what follows we will briefly examine the relevant views of a few
representative figures from each tradition and era. Though none claims
to be inclusive of the entire Middle Ages, the best scholarly
overviews of important aspects of the medieval epistemological
tradition are Tachau (1988), Pasnau (1997), Perler (2006), and
Lagerlund (2010a).

Adam Smith's Moral and Political Philosophy,0.5573195815086365,0.6148003339767456,"

Adam Smith developed a comprehensive and unusual version of moral
sentimentalism in his Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759, TMS).
He did not expressly lay out a political philosophy in similar detail,
but a distinctive set of views on politics can be extrapolated from
elements of both TMS and his Wealth of Nations (1776, WN);
student notes from his lectures on jurisprudence (1762–1763, LJ)
have also helped flesh out his thoughts on governance. A central
thread running through his work is an unusually strong commitment to
the soundness of the ordinary human being’s judgments, and a
concern to fend off attempts, by philosophers and policy-makers, to
replace those judgments with the supposedly better
“systems” invented by intellectuals. In his “History
of Astronomy”, he characterizes philosophy as a discipline that
attempts to connect and regularize the data of everyday experience
(Smith 1795: 44–7); in TMS, he tries to develop moral theory out
of ordinary moral judgments, rather than beginning from a
philosophical vantage point above those judgments; and a central
polemic of WN is directed against the notion that government officials
need to guide the economic decisions of ordinary people. Perhaps
taking a cue from David Hume’s skepticism about the capacity of
philosophy to replace the judgments of common life, Smith is
suspicious of philosophy as conducted from a foundationalist
standpoint, outside the modes of thought and practice it examines.
Instead, he maps common life from within, correcting it where
necessary with its own tools rather than trying either to justify or
to criticize it from an external standpoint. He aims indeed to break
down the distinction between theoretical and ordinary thought. This
intellectual project is not unconnected with his political interest in
guaranteeing to ordinary individuals the “natural liberty”
to act in accordance with their own judgments.

Naturalistic Approaches to Social Construction,0.6525285243988037,0.7058896422386169,"


Social “construction,” “constructionism” and
“constructivism” are terms in wide use in the humanities
and social sciences, and are applied to a diverse range of objects
including the emotions, gender, race, sex, homo- and hetero-sexuality,
mental illness, technology, quarks, facts, reality, and truth. This
sort of terminology plays a number of different roles in different
discourses, only some of which are philosophically interesting, and
fewer of which admit of a “naturalistic” approach—an
approach that treats science as a central and successful (if sometimes
fallible) source of knowledge about the world. If there is any core
idea of social constructionism, it is that some object or objects are
caused or controlled by social or cultural factors rather than natural
factors, and if there is any core motivation of such research, it is
the aim of showing that such objects are or were under our control:
they could be, or might have been, otherwise.


Determination of our representations of the world (including our
ideas, concepts, beliefs, and theories of the world) by factors other
than the world or our sensory experience may undermine our faith that
any independent phenomena are represented or tracked, undermining the
idea that there is a fact of the matter about which way of
representing is correct. And determination of the non-representational
facts of the world by our theories seems to reverse the
“direction of fit” between representation and reality
presupposed by our idea of successful epistemic activity.  For both of
these reasons, proponents and opponents of constructionist thought
have held it to embody a challenge to the naturalism endemic in
contemporary philosophy. But social constructionist themes can be and
have been picked up by naturalists who accommodate and appropriate the
interesting and important cultural phenomena documented by
constructionist authors while sidestepping more radical
anti-scientific and anti-realist theses widely associated with social
constructionism.


 I begin by discussing social
constructionism, and I then discuss some threads of contemporary
naturalism. I go on to consider two different sorts of objects of
social construction—representations and human traits—and 
discuss naturalistic, constructionist approaches to them.

Contemporary Approaches to the Social Contract,0.40468481183052063,0.7942687869071959,"

The idea of the social contract goes back at least to Epicurus
(Thrasher 2013). In its recognizably modern form, however, the idea is
revived by Thomas Hobbes; it was developed in different ways by John
Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. After Kant, the idea
largely fell into disrepute until it was resurrected by John Rawls. It
is now at the heart of the work of a number of moral and political
philosophers. 

The basic idea seems simple: in some way, the agreement of all
individuals subject to collectively enforced social arrangements shows
that those arrangements have some normative property (they are
legitimate, just, obligating, etc.). Even this basic idea, though, is
anything but simple, and even this abstract rendering is objectionable
in many ways. 

To explicate the idea of the social contract we analyze contractual
approaches into five elements: (1) the role of the social contract (2)
the parties (3) agreement (4) the object of agreement (5) what the
agreement is supposed to show.

Social Institutions,0.4574927985668182,0.7851223349571228,"


The term, “social institution” is somewhat unclear both in
ordinary language and in the philosophical literature (see
below). However, contemporary sociology is somewhat more consistent in
its use of the term. Typically, contemporary sociologists use the term
to refer to complex social forms that reproduce themselves such as
governments, the family, human languages, universities, hospitals,
business corporations, and legal systems. A typical definition is that
proffered by Jonathan Turner (Turner 1997: 6): “a complex of
positions, roles, norms and values lodged in particular types of
social structures and organising relatively stable patterns of human
activity with respect to fundamental problems in producing
life-sustaining resources, in reproducing individuals, and in
sustaining viable societal structures within a given
environment.” Again, Anthony Giddens says (Giddens 1984: 24):
“Institutions by definition are the more enduring features of
social life.” He (Giddens 1984: 31) goes on to list as
institutional orders, modes of discourse, political institutions,
economic institutions and legal institutions. The contemporary
philosopher of social science, Rom Harre follows the theoretical
sociologists in offering this kind of definition (Harre 1979: 98):
“An institution was defined as an interlocking double-structure
of persons-as-role-holders or office-bearers and the like, and of
social practices involving both expressive and practical aims and
outcomes.” He gives as examples (Harre 1979: 97) schools, shops,
post offices, police forces, asylums and the British monarchy.
 

In this entry the above-noted contemporary sociological usage will be
followed. Doing so has the virtue of grounding philosophical theory in
the most salient empirical discipline, namely, sociology.


At this point it might be asked why a theory of social institutions
has, or ought to have, any philosophical interest; why not simply
leave such theorising to the sociologists? One important reason stems
from the normative concerns of philosophers. Philosophers, such as
John Rawls (Rawls 1972), have developed elaborate normative theories
concerning the principles of justice that ought to govern social
institutions. Yet they have done so in the absence of a developed
theory of the nature and point of the very entities (social
institutions) to which the principles of justice in question are
supposed to apply. Surely the adequacy of one's normative account of
the justice or otherwise of any given social institution, or system of
social institutions, will depend at least in part on the nature and
point of that social institution or system.
 

The entry has five sections. In the first section various salient
accounts of social institutions are discussed. Accounts emanating from
sociological theory as well as philosophy are mentioned. Here, as
elsewhere, the boundaries between philosophy and non-philosophical
theorising in relation to an empirical science are vague. Hence, it is
important to note the theories of the likes of Durkheim and Talcott
Parsons as well as those of John Searle and David Lewis.


In the second section so-called collective acceptance theories of
social institutions are discussed (Searle 1995 and 2010; Tuomela 2002
and 2007.


In the third section a teleological account of social institutions is
presented (Miller 2001 and 2010). Teleological explanation is out of
fashion in many areas of philosophy. However, it remains influential
in contemporary philosophical theories of social action.


In the fourth section, the so-called agent-structure question is
addressed. At bottom, this issue concerns the apparent inconsistency
between the autonomy (or alleged autonomy) of individual human agents,
on the one hand, and the ubiquity and pervasive influence of social
forms on individual character and behaviour, on the other.


In the fifth and final section the specific normative issue of
the justice of social institutions is explored. This section includes
a discussion of intra-institutional justice, e.g. the justice or
injustice of the reward system within an institution, as well as
extra-institutional justice, e.g. the justice or injustice of a power
relationship between a government and refugees.

Social Minimum,0.4814184904098511,0.7268723845481873,"
Consider the following statements:

People should not be allowed to starve in the streets. 
No one should be denied access to a decent minimum of
health-care. 
Every citizen should be able to meet his or her basic needs. 

These statements all express a widespread view that a political
community should seek to ensure that its members are all able to enjoy
at least a minimally decent standard of living. They assert the
importance of what is often called the social
minimum. However, the exact nature of the social minimum, the
considerations that support it, and, indeed, its basic justifiability,
are all matters of intense philosophical controversy.  The aim here is
to provide a guide through the terrain of these controversies. This is
done in three stages. 
 Firstly, in section 1, we look more
closely at the question, “What is a social minimum?” This
section introduces a number of basic distinctions that will serve to
clarify the discussion. We define a “social minimum” as
that bundle of resources which suffices in the circumstances of a
given society to enable someone to lead a minimally decent life. We
define a “social minimum policy regime” as a set of
policies and institutions that serve to secure reasonable access to
this social minimum for all members of the society. As part of the
task of clarification in this section, we review some of the main
philosophical issues posed by these definitions. In particular, how
are we to understand the notion of a “minimally decent
life”? 
 In section 2, we then consider the
question, “Why a social minimum?” Specifically, we outline
a range of influential theories of social justice, and we consider in
each case whether and how the theory in question might lend support to
the enactment of a social minimum (that is, to the establishment of a
social minimum policy regime). The theories considered include
utilitarianism, libertarianism, left-libertarianism, egalitarian
liberalism, and what we shall term democratic theories of social
justice. 
 In section 3, we then turn
specifically to the critics of enactment, posing the question
“What can be said against enactment of a social minimum?”
We consider three sets of objections that appeal respectively to the
values of individual freedom, fairness, and legitimacy. The objections
are helpful in thinking about the form the social minimum should take
and about the political procedures surrounding its enactment.  We
investigate whether any of these objections offers a convincing reason
against enactment of a social minimum.  Section 4
offers a brief conclusion to our discussion.

Formal Approaches to Social Procedures,0.6422779560089111,0.7257325649261475,"
Social procedures that have algorithmic aspects can often be
improved by redesign. This holds for voting and other peaceful
decision making procedures, for match-making, for auctioning, for fair
division of estates, and for many procedures of distributive
justice. The algorithmic aspects can be analyzed with formal
methods. The term “social software” was coined by Rohit
Parikh (2002) for the emerging
interdisciplinary enterprise that is concerned with the design and
analysis of algorithms that regulate social processes. Such analysis
and (re-)design uses methods from logic, game theory and theoretical
computer science.[1] 
The goals of research in formal approaches
to social procedures are modeling social situations, developing
theories of correctness, and (re-)designing social procedures.
Logic, game theory and computer science are not the only
disciplines that have something to say about social mechanisms. Such
mechanisms are also an object of study in voting theory, in auction
theory, in social choice theory, in mechanism design theory, and in
algorithmic game theory. Multi-agent interaction at a more abstract
level is studied in artificial intelligence and distributed computing,
so all these disciplines have something to say about the formal
analysis of social interaction.

Sociobiology,0.979860246181488,0.5857136845588684,"


The term ‘sociobiology’ was introduced in E. O. Wilson’s
Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975) as the
“systematic study of the biological basis of all social
behavior” (Wilson, 1975, 4). Wilson seems to intend
“the biological basis of behavior” to refer to the social
and ecological causes driving the evolution of behavior in animal
populations, rather than the neurological or psychological causes of
behavior in individuals; however, Wilson clearly thought sociobiology
and neuroscience would have important theoretical interactions (Wilson,
1975, 5). Wilson’s references to evolution are also usually
references to evolution by natural selection, although he does accept
that the action of selection on animal societies can result in
maladaptive outcomes at the level of populations (see, for example
Wilson, 1975, Chapter 4). 


One possible meaning for “sociobiology”, therefore, is
that kind of work identified by Wilson in the non-human animal part of
his book: methodologically adaptationist approaches to understanding
the causes and nature of animal behavior. However, the term
“sociobiology”, especially used of the work that Wilson
described in most of his book, was a neologism, and Wilson used it to
refer to work by scientists who did not use that term to refer to
themselves. Neither was the name “sociobiologist”
ever universally accepted by such scientists. Instead, while a
few scientists continued to use the term “sociobiology” to
describe their work (for example, Hrdy, 1999), during the controversy
over sociobiology and after scientists using these approaches tended to
use other terms, most commonly “behavioral ecology” (Krebs
and Davies, 1978).


However, non-human animal behavior was not the only subject
addressed in Sociobiology; famously, the first and last
chapters of the book addressed Wilson’s views about the
amenability of human behavior to be studied by a similar sort of
project. These were developed to some extent in his later book,
On Human Nature (Wilson, 1978). For a variety of
reasons, primarily because Wilson was perceived to be arguing that many
problematic social behaviors were unchangeable, the contents of these
two chapters provoked an extremely acrimonious debate sometimes
referred to as the “sociobiology wars” (one well regarded
discussion of the history and sociology of the “sociobiology wars”
is Segerstrale, 2000). Because this debate attracted so much
attention, the term “sociobiology” has come to be
associated with this early proposed human project, or at least
the description of it set up for attack by its critics (see, for
example, Allen et al., 1975; Caplan, 1979; Gould, 1977, 251–259; 1978;
Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the People, 1976). 
Wilson’s proposed human project might be called “Pop
Sociobiology” after Kitcher (1985). The critics claimed
that “Pop Sociobiologists” were committed to a form of
genetic determinism, an overly strong adaptationism and had a tendency
to ignore the effects of learning and culture.


The term “sociobiology” is also occasionally used to refer
to current evolutionary approaches to human behavior, which
retain the behavioral focus to which Wilson refers (Griffiths, 2008;
Sterelny and Griffiths, 1999). However, while influenced by the
project Wilson conceived, most modern projects studying the evolution
of behavior seem to have developed a variety of theoretical and
methodological features of their own (Smith et al., 2001; Winterhalder
and Smith, 1992); perhaps the best way to understand sociobiology in
this case is in “phylogenetic” terms, as a historical
ancestor of these projects. The “descendants” of
sociobiology include human behavioral ecology and more
recently, dual inheritance theory (Boyd and Richerson, 1985;
Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1981) and evolutionary psychology
(Cosmides and Tooby, 1987). These projects as a group are now
sometimes referred to as the “evolutionary social
sciences” (Smith et al., 2001)[1].  
Over time the different theoretical views
and choices of methodology have become entrenched in each project,
increasing their disparity; the divisions also partly fall along
disciplinary lines, with anthropologists tending to be human
behavioral ecologists; psychologists tending to be evolutionary
psychologists; and individuals with some background in population
biology modeling ending up in dual inheritance theory. All three
projects retain some of the features of Wilson’s original
project, however, in particular its methodologically adaptationist
approach. Of these three, it is human behavioral ecology that is most
often called “sociobiology” due to its focus on the
evolution of behavior (evolutionary psychology focuses on the
evolution of psychological mechanisms or modules such as those for
cheater detection; dual inheritance theory studies the cultural
evolution of traits that are socially learned). 


This survey will, therefore, focus on three main meanings of
“sociobiology”. First, it will briefly describe the
non-human animal behavioral ecology that Wilson described as
“sociobiology”. Second, it will describe and evaluate
the characterization of “Pop Sociobiology” that came under
attack by various scientists and philosophers in the mid to late 1970s.
Third, it will describe the main features of current human behavioral
ecology. The final section will discuss some of the central
criticisms raised for sociobiology and behavioral ecology in the
literature and explore some possible responses to these criticisms.

The philosopher Socrates remains, as he was in his
lifetime (469–399
 B.C.E.),[1]
 an enigma, an inscrutable individual who, despite having written
nothing, is considered one of the handful of philosophers who forever
changed how philosophy itself was to be conceived. All our information
about him is second-hand and most of it vigorously disputed, but his
trial and death at the hands of the Athenian democracy is nevertheless
the founding myth of the academic discipline of philosophy, and his
influence has been felt far beyond philosophy itself, and in every
age. Because his life is widely considered paradigmatic for the
philosophic life and, more generally, for how anyone ought to
live, Socrates has been encumbered with the admiration and emulation
normally reserved for founders of religious sects—Jesus or
Buddha—strange for someone who tried so hard to make others do
their own thinking, and for someone convicted and executed on the
charge of irreverence toward the gods. Certainly he was impressive, so
impressive that many others were moved to write about him, all of whom
found him strange by the conventions of fifth-century Athens: in his
appearance, personality, and behavior, as well as in his views and
methods.  


So thorny is the difficulty of distinguishing the historical Socrates
from the Socrateses of the authors of the texts in which he appears
and, moreover, from the Socrateses of scores of later interpreters,
that the whole contested issue is generally referred to as the
Socratic problem. Each age, each intellectual turn, produces a
Socrates of its own. It is no less true now that, “The
‘real’ Socrates we have not: what we have is a set of
interpretations each of which represents a ‘theoretically
possible’ Socrates,” as Cornelia de Vogel (1955, 28) put
it. In fact, de Vogel was writing as a new analytic paradigm for
interpreting Socrates was about to become standard—Gregory
Vlastos’s model (§2.2), which would hold sway until the mid
1990s. Who Socrates really was is fundamental to virtually any 
interpretation of the philosophical dialogues of Plato because Socrates is the dominant figure
in most of Plato’s dialogues.

Sophismata,0.7485527396202087,0.18293704092502594,"


In contrast to the meaning the word ‘sophism’ had in
ancient philosophy, ‘sophisma’ in medieval
philosophy is a technical term with no pejorative connotation: a
sophisma proper is a sentence (proposition) that raises a
difficulty for logic or grammar: it is a proposition of which the
truth value is difficult to determine, because it is ambiguous,
puzzling or simply difficult to interpret, or a sentence that can be
shown to be both grammatically correct and incorrect.  Discussions
of sophismata can be found in treatises of the twelfth
century. Later they formed an important element of scholarly training
in universities, featuring in different kinds of disputations: on a
basic level the sophismata served to illustrate a theory, but
they were also used to test the limits of a theory. The so-called
sophismata-literature flourished during the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries; many important developments in philosophy,
mainly in logic and natural philosophy, appeared in texts of this
kind, where masters could feel free to investigate problems and
develop their own views, much more than they could in more academic
and strictly codified literary genres. In the wake of humanists'
opposition against the educational practices of traditional
universities, the genre of sophismata disappeared in the
early sixteenth century.

Sorites Paradox,0.8126807808876038,0.7438281774520874,"

The sorites paradox originated in an ancient puzzle that appears to be
generated by vague terms, viz., terms with unclear
(“blurred” or “fuzzy”) boundaries of
application. ‘Bald’, ‘heap’,
‘tall’, ‘old’, and ‘blue’ are
prime examples of vague terms: no clear line divides people who are
bald from people who are not, or blue objects from green (hence not
blue), or old people from middle-aged (hence not old). Because the
predicate ‘heap’ has unclear boundaries, it seems that no
single grain of wheat can make the difference between a number of
grains that does, and a number that does not, make a heap. Therefore,
since one grain of wheat does not make a heap, it follows that two
grains do not; and if two do not, then three do not; and so on. This
reasoning leads to the absurd conclusion that no number of grains of
wheat make a heap. 

The same form of reasoning is familiar in everyday life. Dorothy
Edgington observes:


There’s the ‘mañana paradox’: the unwelcome
task which needs to be done, but it’s always a matter of
indifference whether it’s done today or tomorrow; the
dieter’s paradox: I don’t care at all about the difference
to my weight one chocolate will make. (1997: 296)


The puzzle can be expressed as an argument most simply using modus
ponens: 


1 grain of wheat does not make a heap.
If 1 grain doesn’t make a heap, then 2 grains
don’t.
If 2 grains don’t make a heap, then 3 grains
don’t.
…
If 999,999 grains don’t make a heap, then 1 million grains
don’t.

Therefore,
1 million grains don’t make a heap.



The argument is a paradox because apparently impeccable reasoning from
apparently impeccable premises yields a falsehood. The argument can be
run equally in the opposite direction, from the premise that one
million grains make a heap: if one million grains make a heap, then
one million less one grain make a heap; and if one million less one
grain make a heap, then one million less two grains make a heap; etc.
It follows, absurdly, that even a single grain makes a heap. Thus
soritical reasoning appears to show both that no number of grains make
a heap and that any number of grains make a heap.

What conclusion should we draw from this untoward result? Is there
something wrong with the paradoxical argument, or does the use of
vague predicates really lead to
 absurdity?[1]
 In part because we use these ordinary words successfully all the
time, and do not normally land in absurdities like the ones above,
most theorists of vagueness suppose that the paradox is solvable,
i.e., that the paradoxical argument is defective and we can discover
the defect. In what follows we consider some of the principal attempts
to solve it.

Sortals,0.6925053000450134,0.2913937270641327,"

The world seems to consist of stuff and things. Some of the stuff
composes things—that wood constitutes this ship. Some things
endure for a long time—the 2nd century Pantheon
building in Rome—others are transient—a sandcastle on the
beach. People care, to varying degrees, what kind of thing is being
considered, and whether the one they are discussing is the same one.
The Pantheon in Rome today is the same one that was there in AD 150;
the sandcastle on the beach today, though it is in the same location
and looks the same, is not the one the tide washed away last night.
Why do we care about objects and not just the stuff? Because objects
are stuff with extra properties, properties that often persist and are
often useful to know about even if the stuff changes

Philosophical realists view the emergence of objects from the stuff as
an objective matter independent of human thought or interests; other
philosophers argue instead that it is human cognition or language that
produces the appearance of objects. Many philosophers have believed
that the notion of a sortal is a, perhaps the, crucial philosophical
tool in analyzing these issues and resolving the debates. Recently
psychologists have also taken notice of the concept and argued for the
importance of sortals in cognitive development. And researchers in
artificial intelligence, specifically knowledge representation, have
also started to use the idea. Unfortunately, there are conflicting
understandings of the technical philosophical term sortal; authors
often write at cross-purposes, which means that readers of any text
about sortals should approach cautiously. 

The three main ideas are that a sortal

 tells us what the essence of a thing is 
 tells us how to count things of that kind, which requires knowing
which things are different and which are the same
 tells us when something continues to exist, and when it goes out
of existence


John Locke, who coined the term in 1690, was primarily concerned with
(1), Peter Strawson, who in 1959 was the next to use the term, was
primarily concerned with (3). Two historically intermediate
philosophers who did not use the term but were interested in the
concept, Spinoza and Frege, were primarily interested in (2).

What are some examples of sortals? The most generally agreed upon
feature of sortals is that they provide a criterion for what is to be
counted. All of the sortals listed next are counting sortals. Among
the counting sortals, some are phase sortals—sortals that
typically apply to something during part of its existence. An example
is colt—the horse does not go out of existence when it
matures and ceases to be a colt. Another category is restricted
sortals, which also may cease to be true of the object without its
going out of existence, for example a brown dog may turn
gray. Philosophers debate about sortals and essences; we would
distinguish between basic level sortals, the kind of noun or phrase
that is most typically given as an answer to What is it? Questions.
Good examples of answers to the question understood this way would be
elephant or car. This form of sortal has strong
affinities in some domains with what are called natural kinds, but
many sortals apply to artifacts and not to natural objects. Another
level of What is it? answer is at a very general categorial level,
where some of the typical answers would be animal
or vehicle. 

Most nouns that are not sortals can form sortals in contexts where a
unit is implicated, often without the supplementary unit being
explicit. Coffee and gold are not sortals by most accounts, but we can
intelligibly ask how many coffees Harry drank or how many golds the
ski team won. It is understood from context that we are asking about
cups of coffee and gold medals.  These unitized
sortals can be in any of the forms discussed above.

One of the most central kinds of sortal, and one of the most difficult
to give uncontroversial examples of, are the persistence sortals. A
persistence sortal is one where, if the sortal is no longer true of
the object, the object no longer exists. If a car is crushed into a
metal cube, the car no longer exists. But if the car is transformed
into a boat, does some one thing exist first as a car and then as a
boat? According to some views, when someone dies they cease to exist;
according to various other views, the same person may be reincarnated
in a new form. Is a werewolf sometimes a person and sometimes a wolf,
or are they always a werewolf and neither a person nor wolf.

Sounds,0.7845700979232788,0.3373023569583893,"


Philosophy of perception typically centered on colors, as did the
metaphysics of mind when discussing the mind-dependence of secondary
qualities. Possibly, the philosophical privilege of the visible just
reflects the cognitive privilege of the visible—as vision is
considered to account for most of useful sensory information
gathering.


This neglect of sounds is at times a regrettable state of affairs,
as sounds are not only an important element of the perceptual scene but
are also philosophically idiosyncratic in many intriguing ways; in
particular, their temporal and spatial unfolding, as presented in
perception, has interesting metaphysical and epistemological aspects.
There is, however, an advantage of the neglect. Many philosophical
aspects of sound and sound perception are not idiosyncratic and indeed
make for general issues in philosophy of perception. Hence in this
article we will take advantage of the many discussions that have used
other sensory features such as colors as a paradigm of a sensory
feature. For instance, we shall not rehearse the discussion about the
subjectivity of secondary qualities, as the example of sounds does not
seem to introduce new philosophically interesting elements that could
challenge generalizations obtained, say, from the example of
colors.


The main issues which are on the table concern the nature of sounds.
Sounds enter the content of auditory perception. But what are they? Are
sounds individuals? Are they events? Are they properties of sounding
objects? If they are events, what type of event are they? What is the
relation between sounds and sounding objects? Temporal and causal
features of sounds will be important in deciding these and related
questions. However, it turns out that a fruitful way to organize these
issues deals with the spatial properties of sounds.


Indeed, the various philosophical pronouncements about the nature of
sounds can be rather neatly classified according to the spatial status
each of them assigns to sounds. Where are sounds? Are they anywhere?
The main relevant families of answers include proximal, medial, distal,
and aspatial theories. Proximal theories would claim that sounds are
where the hearer is. Medial theories – exemplified by mainstream
acoustics – locate sounds in the medium between the resonating
object and the hearer. Distal theories consider sounds to be located at
the resonating object. Finally, aspatial theories deny spatial
relevance to sounds. There are significant variants of each of these.
Sound theories can also be classified according to other dimensions,
such as the metaphysical status they accord to sounds (for instance, as
occurring events as opposed to properties or dispositions). We shall
see some of the interactions between these different accounts.

Sovereignty,0.4020831286907196,0.6531689167022705,"


Sovereignty, though its meanings have varied across history, also
has a core meaning, supreme authority within a territory. It
is a modern notion of political authority. Historical variants can be
understood along three dimensions — the holder of sovereignty, the
absoluteness of sovereignty, and the internal and external dimensions
of sovereignty. The state is the political institution in which
sovereignty is embodied. An assemblage of states forms a sovereign
states system.


The history of sovereignty can be understood through two broad
movements, manifested in both practical institutions and political
thought. The first is the development of a system of sovereign states,
culminating at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Contemporaneously,
sovereignty became prominent in political thought through the writings
of Machiavelli, Luther, Bodin, and Hobbes. The second movement is the
circumscription of the sovereign state, which began in practice after
World War II and has since continued through European integration and
the growth and strengthening of laws and practices to protect human
rights. The most prominent corresponding political thought occurs in
the writings of critics of sovereignty like Bertrand de Jouvenel and
Jacques Maritain.

Absolute and Relational Theories of Space and Motion,0.8674220442771912,0.3687029480934143,"


Since antiquity, natural philosophers have struggled to comprehend the
nature of three tightly interconnected concepts: space, time, and
motion. A proper understanding of motion, in particular, has been seen
to be crucial for deciding questions about the natures of space and
time, and their interconnections. Since the time of Newton and
Leibniz, philosophers' struggles to comprehend these concepts
have often appeared to take the form of a dispute between
absolute conceptions of space, time and motion, and
relational conceptions. This article guides the reader
through some of the history of these philosophical struggles. Rather
than taking sides in the (alleged) ongoing debates, or reproducing the
standard dialectic recounted in most introductory texts, we have
chosen to scrutinize carefully the history of the thinking of the
canonical participants in these debates — principally Descartes,
Newton, Leibniz, Mach and Einstein. Readers interested in following up
either the historical questions or current debates about the natures
of space, time and motion will find ample links and references

events were simultaneous did not necessarily have a definite answer,

convention is, in fact, the only possible choice within the framework

alternative choices, although perhaps less convenient, are indeed

Singularities and Black Holes,0.8922395110130309,0.35969996452331543,"


A spacetime singularity is a breakdown in the geometrical structure
of space and time. It is a topic of ongoing physical and philosophical
research to clarify both the nature and significance of such
pathologies. Because it is the fundamental geometry that is breaking
down, spacetime singularities are often viewed as an end, or “edge,” of
spacetime itself. However, numerous difficulties arise when one tries
to make this notion more precise.


Our current theory of spacetime, general relativity, not only allows
for singularities, but tells us that they are unavoidable in some
real-life circumstances. Thus we apparently need to understand the
ontology of singularities if we are to grasp the nature of space and
time in the actual universe. The possibility of singularities also
carries potentially important implications for the issues of physical
determinism and the scope of physical laws.


Black holes are regions of spacetime from which nothing, not even
light, can escape. A typical black hole is the result of the
gravitational force becoming so strong that one would have to travel
faster than light to escape its pull. Such black holes contain a
spacetime singularity at their center; thus we cannot fully understand
a black hole without also understanding the nature of singularities.
However, black holes raise several additional conceptual issues. As
purely gravitational entities, black holes are at the heart of many
attempts to formulate a theory of quantum gravity. Although they are
regions of spacetime, black holes are also thermodynamical entities,
with a temperature and an entropy; however, it is far from clear what
statistical physics underlies these thermodynamical facts. The
evolution of black holes is also apparently in conflict with standard
quantum evolution, for such evolution rules out the sort of increase in
entropy that seems to be required when black holes are present. This
has led to a debate over what fundamental physical principles are
likely to be preserved in, or violated by, a full quantum theory of
gravity.

A supertask is a task that consists in infinitely many component

time. Supertasks were studied by the pre-Socratics and continue to be
objects of interest to modern philosophers, logicians and physicists.
The term “super-task” itself was coined by J.F. Thomson

mechanics. We then discuss the possibility of supertasks from the

The nature of species is controversial in biology and philosophy.
Biologists disagree on the definition of the term
‘species,’ and philosophers disagree over the ontological
status of species. Yet a proper understanding of species is important for
a number of reasons. Species are the fundamental taxonomic units of
biological classification.  Environmental laws are framed in terms of
species. Even our conception of human nature is affected by our
understanding of species. In this entry, three issues
concerning species are discussed. The first is the ontological status
of species. The second is whether biologists should be species
pluralists or species monists. The third is whether the theoretical
term ‘species’ refers to a real category in nature.

We are attuned in everyday conversation not primarily to the sentences
we utter to one another, but to the speech acts that those utterances
are used to perform: requests, warnings, invitations, promises,
apologies, predictions, and the like. Such acts are staples of
communicative life, but only became a topic of sustained
investigation, at least in the English-speaking world, in the middle
of the Twentieth 
Century.[1] 
Since that time “speech act theory” has become influential
not only within philosophy, but also in linguistics, psychology, legal
theory, artificial intelligence, literary theory, and feminist thought
among other scholarly 
 disciplines.[2] 
Recognition of the significance of speech
acts has illuminated the ability of language to do other things than
describe reality. In the process the boundaries among the philosophy
of language, the philosophy of action, aesthetics, the philosophy of
mind, political philosophy, and ethics have become less sharp. In
addition, an appreciation of speech acts has helped lay bare a
normative structure implicit in linguistic practice, including even
that part of this practice concerned with describing reality. Much
recent research aims at an accurate characterization of this normative
structure underlying linguistic practice.

Herbert Spencer,0.4989391267299652,0.6487744450569153,"

Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) is typically, though quite wrongly,
considered a coarse social Darwinist. After all, Spencer, and not
Darwin, coined the infamous expression “survival of the
fittest”, leading G. E. Moore to conclude erroneously in
Principia Ethica (1903) that Spencer committed the
naturalistic fallacy. According to Moore, Spencer’s practical
reasoning was deeply flawed insofar as he purportedly conflated mere
survivability (a natural property) with goodness itself (a non-natural
property).

Roughly fifty years later, Richard Hofstadter devoted an entire
chapter of Social Darwinism in American Thought (1955) to
Spencer, arguing that Spencer’s unfortunate vogue in late
nineteenth-century America inspired Andrew Carnegie and William Graham
Sumner’s visions of unbridled and unrepentant capitalism. For
Hofstadter, Spencer was an “ultra-conservative” for whom
the poor were so much unfit detritus. His social philosophy
“walked hand in hand” with reaction, making it little more
than a “biological apology for laissez-faire” (Hofstadter,
1955: 41 and 46). But just because Carnegie interpreted Spencer’s
social theory as justifying merciless economic competition, we
shouldn’t automatically attribute such justificatory ambitions to
Spencer. Otherwise, we risk uncritically reading the fact that Spencer
happened to influence popularizers of social Darwinism into our
interpretation of him. We risk falling victim to what Skinner
perceptively calls the “mythology of prolepsis.”

Spencer’s reputation has never fully recovered from Moore and
Hofstadter’s interpretative caricatures, thus marginalizing him to the
hinterlands of intellectual history, though recent scholarship has
begun restoring and repairing his legacy. Happily, in rehabilitating
him, some scholars have begun to appreciate just how fundamentally
utilitarian his practical reasoning was.

The history of political thought is forever being rewritten as we
necessarily reinterpret its canonical texts and occasionally
renominate marginalized thinkers for canonical consideration. Changing
philosophical fashions and ideological agendas invariably doom us to
reconstructing incessantly our political philosophical heritage. For
instance, Isaiah Berlin’s understandable preoccupation with
totalitarianism induced him to read T. H. Green and Bernard Bosanquet
as its unwitting accomplices insofar as both purportedly equated
freedom with dangerously enriched, neo-Hegelian fancies about
self-realization. Regrettably, this ideological reconstruction of new
liberals like Green and Bosanquet continues largely unabated (see
Skinner, 2002: 16). But as our ideological sensitivities shift, we can
now begin rereading them with changed prejudice, if not less
prejudice. And the same goes for how we can now reread other
marginalized, nineteenth-century English liberals like Spencer. As the
shadow of European totalitarianism wanes, the lens through which we do
intellectual history changes and we can more easily read our Spencer
as he intended to be read, namely as a utilitarian who wanted to be a
liberal just as much.

Like J. S. Mill, Spencer struggled to make utilitarianism
authentically liberal by infusing it with a demanding principle of
liberty and robust moral rights. He was convinced, like Mill, that
utilitarianism could accommodate rights with independent moral force
and yet remain genuinely consequentialist. Subtly construed,
utilitarianism can effectively mimick the very best deontological
liberalism.

Speusippus,0.6691204905509949,0.07405414432287216,"

Speusippus of Athens was the son of Plato’s sister Potone; he became
head of the Academy on Plato’s death in 348/347 and remained its head
for eight years (Diogenes Laertius iv 1), apparently until his death.
His date of birth is harder to get a fix on; it has reasonably been
estimated at ca. 410. He apparently wrote a lot: “a great many
treatises and many dialogues” (ibid. iv 4; Diogenes
lists about 30 titles, and his bibliography is on his own admission
incomplete). We have very little of what he wrote, if any (we have
something from a work later attributed to him, On Pythagorean
Numbers, discussed below, but this is not one of Diogenes’
titles; and we may have something preserved in Iamblichus, De
communi mathematica scientia iv, also discussed
below).

Diogenes tells us (iv 1) that Speusippus “abided by the views of
Plato”; from what little we can tell, this is simply false. In

Baruch Spinoza,0.6105749607086182,0.3453281819820404,"

Bento (in Hebrew, Baruch; in Latin, Benedictus) Spinoza is one of the
most important philosophers—and certainly the most
radical—of the early modern period. His thought combines a
commitment to a number of Cartesian metaphysical and epistemological
principles with elements from ancient Stoicism, Hobbes, and medieval
Jewish rationalism into a nonetheless highly original system. His
extremely naturalistic views on God, the world, the human being and
knowledge serve to ground a moral philosophy centered on the control
of the passions leading to virtue and happiness. They also lay the
foundations for a strongly democratic political thought and a deep
critique of the pretensions of Scripture and sectarian religion. Of
all the philosophers of the seventeenth century, perhaps none have
more relevance today than Spinoza.

Spinoza's Physical Theory,0.6159980893135071,0.34824830293655396,"

Spinoza's thought stands at an uneasy and volatile period in the
development of physical theory. His physical science is largely
Cartesian, both in content and rationalistic method. It is harshly
dismissive of the “occult qualities, intentional species,
substantial forms, and a thousand other trifles” (letter 60, to
Boxel) of pre-revolutionary scholastic natural philosophy. It is
likewise antagonistic to the new Baconian experimentalism, holding
that empirical findings can at best present examples of what reason
itself demonstrates.   Spinoza neither perceives the
particular difficulties for Cartesian physical theory that lead
Leibniz to revive both finalism and substantial forms, nor foresees
the Newtonian theory of universal gravitation whose mathematical and
empirical superiority to the Cartesian vortex theory lead to its
universal acceptance, despite its own revival of occult powers in the
form of forces operating at a distance.

Yet Spinoza is no orthodox Cartesian. He recognizes a variety of
shortcomings in Descartes' physical views and moreover rejects much of
the metaphysical foundation upon which these views rest. In light of
these disagreements, Spinoza holds that bodies are not substances, but
rather modifications of a single substance, and he develops a
distinctive and novel view of their individuation. He must also find
an alternative basis for the basic principles that underlie and
explain the motion and interaction of bodies. The resulting physical
view arguably contains anticipations of the fundamental character of
modern physics, and certainly anticipates modern theory of homeostatic
systems. Yet in spite of its express mechanistic and deterministic
character, Spinoza's physical theory appears to exploit an irreducible
element of finalism, and to accord an important explanatory role to
individual bodily essences.

This article first briefly discusses and places in context the textual
sources most relevant to a consideration of Spinoza's physics. It then
present in brief summary those of Spinoza's philosophical views that
bear most directly on his physical theory. Having identified the
central issues for physical theory that emerge, it then clarifies
those issues by examining the sources in more detail. Finally, it
situates Spinoza's views vis-à-vis contemporary
experimental and mathematical science.

Spinoza's Political Philosophy,0.6112675666809082,0.3543095886707306,"


At least in anglophone countries, Spinoza's reputation as a
political thinker is eclipsed by his reputation as a rationalist
metaphysician. Nevertheless, Spinoza was a penetrating political
theorist whose writings have enduring significance. In his two
political treatises, Spinoza advances a number of forceful and original
arguments in defense of democratic governance, freedom of thought and
expression, and the subordination of religion to the state. On the
basis of his naturalistic metaphysics, Spinoza also offers trenchant
criticisms of ordinary conceptions of right and duty. And his account
of civil organization, grounded in psychological realism, stands as an
important contribution to the development of constitutionalism and the
rule of law.

Spinoza's Psychological Theory,0.612786591053009,0.3549068570137024,"


In Part III of his Ethics, “On the Origin and Nature of
the Affects,” which is the subject of this article, Spinoza
addresses two of the most serious challenges facing his thoroughgoing
naturalism. First, he attempts to show that human beings follow the
order of nature. Human beings, on Spinoza’s view, have causal natures
similar in kind to other ordinary objects, other “finite
modes” in the technical language of the Ethics, so they
ought to be analyzed and understood in the same way as the rest of
nature. Second, Spinoza attempts to show that moral concepts, such as
the concepts of good and evil, virtue, and perfection, have a basis in
human psychology. Just as human beings are no different from the rest
of nature, so moral concepts are no different from other
concepts. Spinoza’s detailed account of the human affects—the
actions and passions of the human mind—is crucial to both
tasks. For his argument to succeed, the theory of the affects must be
both a plausible account of human psychology and also a plausible
basis for ethics.

Spinoza's Theory of Attributes,0.6209036707878113,0.34313729405403137,"


Attributes sit at the very heart of Spinoza’s metaphysics.
They enable us to understand and talk about an extended world and a
thinking world in terms of which we understand such things as bodies and minds.
Furthermore, it is due to the relation of attributes to one another and
to the infinite substance that an elegant resolution to the Cartesian
mind–body problem is possible. Attributes furnish Spinoza’s
substance with variety while preventing it from being an ephemeral,
homogenous totality—an eleatic “one” of which nothing
can be said or known. They constitute variety without dissolving the
infinite substance into multiple substances.


Spinoza defines the term “attribute” in Definition 4 of
Part One of the Ethics thus: “Per attributum
intelligo id, quod intellectus de substantia percipit, tanquam ejusdem
essentiam constituens.” That is, “By attribute I
understand what the intellect perceives of substance as constituting
its essence.”[1]
 Nonetheless, it is astonishing how little agreement there is among
scholars as to some of the most basic features of Spinoza’s
theory of attributes. For this reason, this article first considers the important
places where Spinoza establishes fundamental characteristics of
attributes: such as their definition, their real distinction, and their
identification with the substance. It then explains the main
issue on which interpretations diverge and signals in broad terms which
interpretative avenues have been taken or are conceptually open
(without delving too deeply into any one of them). In light of these
very different interpretative avenues the article revisits some of the
characteristics explained in the first part and considers how they are
affected by the different kinds of interpretations. Finally, and
perhaps most importantly, given the holistic and systematic nature of
Spinoza’s metaphysics and the central role attributes play in it,
the article points out how the different interpretative options on one
issue bear on others (e.g. the number of attributes and the
understanding of 2P7 and its scholium). The different ways of
understanding Spinoza’s theory of attributes inevitably give rise
to very different conceptions of Spinoza’s metaphysics as a
whole.

The Traditional Square of Opposition,0.7084517478942871,0.15953387320041654,"


This entry traces the historical development of the Square of
Opposition, a collection of logical relationships traditionally
embodied in a square diagram. This body of doctrine provided a
foundation for work in logic for over two millenia. For most of this
history, logicians assumed that negative particular propositions
(“Some S is not P”) are vacuously true
if their subjects are empty. This validates the logical laws embodied
in the diagram, and preserves the doctrine against modern
criticisms. Certain additional principles
(“contraposition” and “obversion”) were
sometimes adopted along with the Square, and they genuinely yielded
inconsistency. By the nineteenth century an inconsistent set of
doctrines was widely adopted. Strawson’s 1952 attempt to rehabilitate
the Square does not apply to the traditional doctrine; it does salvage
the nineteenth century version but at the cost of yielding inferences
that lead from truth to falsity when strung together.

Śrīharṣa,0.7620032429695129,0.3363316655158997,"

Śrīharṣa was an Indian philosopher and poet, who lived
in northern India in the 12th century
 CE.[1]
 Śrīharṣa didn’t affiliate himself explicitly to
any philosophical text tradition active in classical India. Some have
argued that he was an advocate of Advaita Vedānta (Phillips 1995;
Ram-Prasad 2002). Vedānta (literally, the end of the Vedas) is a
family of competing philosophical interpretations of the texts called
Upaniṣads that appear at the end of the
 Vedas.[2]
 Many texts of Vedānta are commentaries on the canonical summary
of the Upaniṣads given by Bādarāyaņa’s
Aphorisms on the Brahman (Brahmasūtra). Advaita
Vedānta (i.e., non-dualistic Vedānta) is an interpretation
of the Upaniṣads and Bādarāyaņa’s
Aphorisms, according to which it is only the self or
consciousness or Brahman that is ultimately real. The Indian
philosopher Śaṃkara (7th century CE) defended
this form of non-dualism in his commentary on
Bādarāyaṇa’s Aphorisms.
Śrīharṣa’s only surviving philosophical
 work[3]
The Sweets of Refutation
(Khaṇḍanakhaṇḍanakhādya) may be
read as a defense of this kind of non-dualism, even though he
doesn’t share all the standard commitments of Śaṃkara
and his followers. This reading of Śrīharṣa, however,
remains controversial (Granoff
 1978).[4]

The broader appeal of Śrīharṣa’s work is
independent of whether he was a defender of Advaita Vedānta.
Throughout The Sweets of Refutation,
Śrīharṣa’s aim is to demonstrate the instability
of rational inquiry within philosophy. For any argument that a
philosopher may offer for her view, there is always an equally
persuasive counterargument that undermines its conclusion. Since the
deliverances of reason are always vulnerable to rational defeat in
this way, they cannot constitute good evidence for any philosophical
view. To illustrate this idea, Śrīharṣa targets a
philosophical method—what we may call the method of
definition—pursued by Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika
philosophers in informal logic, epistemology and
 metaphysics.[5]
 The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers use this method of
definition to describe a number of ontological categories which are
supposed to capture the structure of reality, and a number of
epistemological and logical categories which are supposed to capture
various components of rational inquiry. What the
Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosopher wishes to affirm in the
end is a dualistic ontology: the commonsense view on which
reality consists of a plurality of things distinct from the self or
consciousness, e.g., material things, their qualities, relations
amongst them, and so on. Śrīharṣa wants to show that
any attempt at defining the epistemological, logical, and
ontological categories that the dualist needs for the success of her
project must fail: the very standards of rational inquiry that the
Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers adopt undermine their
theoretical enterprise from within.

Śrīharṣa’s incisive arguments against
Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika informal logic, epistemology and
metaphysics were influential amongst the defenders of both Advaita
Vedānta and Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika
 philosophy.[6]
 However, they should also be of considerable interest to the
contemporary reader. In the second half of the twentieth century,
Anglophone philosophers have grappled with various difficulties that
arise for definitions of epistemological notions like
knowledge and metaphysical notions like causation.
While attacking the method of definition pursued by the
Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers, Śrīharṣa
anticipates many of these difficulties. His reaction to these
difficulties is pessimistic: he takes these difficulties to
demonstrate the futility of offering definitions for commonsense
epistemological and ontological categories.
Śrīharṣa’s arguments for this conclusion remain
as relevant to our current philosophical concerns as they were to
those of his contemporaries: if his arguments are successful, they
will show that philosophical inquiry doesn’t really take us very
far when it comes to illuminating fundamental epistemological and
metaphysical concepts.

Since it is impossible to address all the philosophically interesting
themes that emerge from Śrīharṣa’s work, most of
our discussion in this article shall focus on a small number of topics
that illustrate Śrīharṣa’s general approach to
philosophical problems.

States of Affairs,0.7865899801254272,0.6031949520111084,"

Philosophers connect sentences with various different items, such as
thoughts, facts and states of affairs. Thoughts are either
true or false in an absolute sense, never both or neither. A sentence
such as “Socrates is wise” is true (false) in virtue of
expressing the true (false) thought that Socrates is wise. Thoughts
are also the contents of propositional attitudes like belief and
desire. For example, John’s belief that Vulcan is a planet is a
relation between him and the thought that Vulcan is a planet. Since
there is no such planet, the thought that Vulcan is a planet cannot be
composed of Vulcan and the property of being a planet. It is
composed, among other things, of a way of thinking that purports to
latch on to a planet. This so-called mode of presentation may be
expressed by a definite description like “the planet between the
Sun and Mercury”.

Some philosophers take it to be obvious that if something is true,
there must be something that makes it true, a truth-maker.
Facts are truth-makers. Like sentences and thoughts, facts
are taken to be complex objects. The constituents of (atomic) facts
are not words or modes of presentation, but particulars and properties
(see, for instance, Armstrong 1986: 85). The fact that Socrates is
wise exists if, and only if Socrates is wise.

The sentence “Socrates is wise” is not only said to
express the thought that Socrates is wise that is made true by the
fact that Socrates is wise, but also to describe the state of
affairs Socrates’ being wise.

Before pressing on a note about terminology: many philosophers follow
Armstrong’s (1993: 429) terminology who uses “states of
affairs” to refer to facts. (Armstrong’s book A World
of States of Affairs is solely concerned with facts.) This
article is not devoted to “Armstrongian” states
of affairs, but to states of affairs in the sense that is prominent in
the work of such philosophers as Reinach, Russell (at one time), the
early Wittgenstein and
 Plantinga.[1]
 Plantinga helps us to get a grip on the intended notion:


There are such things as states of affairs; among them we find some
that obtain, or are actual, and some that do not obtain. So, for
example, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s being more than seven feet
tall is a state of affairs, as is Spiro Agnew’s being
President of Yale University. Although each of these is a state
of affairs, the former but not the latter obtains, or is actual. And
although the latter is not actual, it is a possible state of
affairs; in this regard it differs from David’s having
travelled faster than the speed of light and Paul’s
having squared the circle. (Plantinga 1974: 44)


If there is the state of affairs Spiro Agnew’s being
President of Yale University, it is not a fact (an Armstrongian
“state of affairs”). For Spiro Agnew was never President
of Yale University. Hereafter, “states of affairs” is used
only for states of affairs that exist whether they obtain or not.

States of affairs are similar to thoughts. Thoughts are true or false;
states of affairs obtain or not. There are also similarities between
facts and states of affairs. Both facts and states of affairs are
supposed to be complexes that contain (in a sense to be explained
further) objects and properties.

Situation theory takes sentences to describe situations (see Barwise
& Perry 1983). How are situations related to states of affairs?
Barwise describes situations informally as “portions of the
world” (Barwise 1989: 225). A portion of a world, say the Lower
East Side of Manhattan, does not obtain or not (see ibid.).
It is not a state of affairs, but a spatial part of a larger spatial
whole.

Does one need states of affairs in addition to facts and thoughts? In
order to answer this question we need to know what states of affairs
are and how they contrast and compare with thoughts and facts. We
therefore begin by outlining the theoretical role states of affairs
are supposed to play.

Boltzmann's Work in Statistical Physics,0.9740322828292848,0.4024398624897003,"


Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) is generally acknowledged as one of
the most important physicists of the nineteenth century. Particularly
famous is his statistical explanation of the second law of
thermodynamics. The celebrated formula \(S = k \log W\), expressing a
relation between entropy \(S\) and probability \(W\) has been engraved
on his tombstone (even though he never actually wrote this formula
down). Boltzmann's views on statistical physics continue to play an
important role in contemporary debates on the foundations of that
theory.


However, Boltzmann's ideas on the precise relationship between the
thermodynamical properties of macroscopic bodies and their microscopic
constitution, and the role of probability in this relationship are
involved and differed quite remarkably in different periods of his
life. Indeed, in his first paper in statistical physics of 1866, he
claimed to obtain a completely general theorem from mechanics that
would prove the second law. However, thirty years later he stated that
the second law could never be proved by mechanical means alone, but
depended essentially on probability theory. In his lifelong struggle
with the problem he employed a varying arsenal of tools and
assumptions. (To mention a few: the so-called Stoßzahlansatz,
the ergodic hypothesis, ensembles, the combinatorial argument, the
hypothesis of molecular disorder.) However, the exact role of these
assumptions, and the results he obtained from them, also shifted in
the course of time.  Particularly notorious are the role of the
ergodic hypothesis and the status of the so-called H-theorem.
Moreover, he used ‘probability’ in four different
technical meanings.  It is, therefore, not easy to speak of a
consistent, single “Boltzmannian approach” to statistical physics. It
is the purpose of this essay to describe the evolution of a selection
of these approaches and their conceptual problems.

Philosophy of Statistics,0.7927660346031189,0.8427388668060303,"
Statistics investigates and develops specific methods for
evaluating hypotheses in the light of empirical facts. A method is
called statistical, and thus the subject of study in statistics, if it
relates facts and hypotheses of a particular kind: the empirical facts
must be codified and structured into data sets, and the hypotheses
must be formulated in terms of probability distributions over possible
data sets. The philosophy of statistics concerns the foundations and
the proper interpretation of statistical methods, their input, and
their results.  Since statistics is relied upon in almost all
empirical scientific research, serving to support and communicate
scientific findings, the philosophy of statistics is of key importance
to the philosophy of science. It has an impact on the philosophical
appraisal of scientific method, and on the debate over the epistemic
and ontological status of scientific theory.
The philosophy of statistics harbors a large variety of topics and
debates. Central to these is the 
 problem of induction,
which concerns the justification of inferences or procedures that
extrapolate from data to predictions and general facts. Further
debates concern the
 interpretation of the probabilities
that are used in statistics, and the wider theoretical framework
that may ground and justify the correctness of statistical methods. A
general introduction to these themes is given in
 Section 1 and
 Section 2. 
 Section 3 and 
 Section 4 provide an account of how
these themes play out in the two major theories of statistical method,
classical and Bayesian statistics respectively.

selection and simplicity, but also discussing statistical techniques
that do not rely on statistical models.

other themes from the philosophy of science, including 
 confirmation theory,
 evidence, 
 causality, measurement, and scientific

Susan Stebbing was a leading figure in British philosophy between the
First and Second World Wars. She made significant contributions to the
development of the analytic tradition, both in establishing it
institutionally and in showing how its ideas and techniques could be
applied in a wide range of domains. Her early work focused on logic
and during her lifetime she was celebrated chiefly for A Modern
Introduction to Logic (1930), which offered an account of both
traditional, Aristotelian logic and the new mathematical logic
associated particularly with the work of Russell and Whitehead. She
went on to be both an important proponent of what came to be known as
the Cambridge School of Analysis and an advocate of the relevance of
logic to everyday questions and problems. In her early work on logic
and increasingly in her later work on thinking and reasoning, she
stressed the ways in which language is used and misused in ordinary
communication and argued that philosophers must pay heed to these uses
and misuses. Stebbing felt increasingly compelled to engage with
practical contemporary issues and to address a wider public audience.
Philosophy and the Physicists (1937) and Thinking to Some
Purpose (1939) offer, respectively, critiques of the language
used in popular science communication and in everyday genres such as
political speeches, advertisements, and newspaper editorials. Towards
the end of her life, her interests in logic and language became
increasingly socially directed and politically engaged.
Stebbing’s work foreshadowed a number of important subsequent
developments both in philosophy itself and in linguistics.

Charles Leslie Stevenson,0.5650100708007812,0.6727645397186279,"
 Charles Leslie Stevenson (1908–1979) was a mid-Twentieth
Century American philosopher best known for his pioneering work in the
field of metaethics (the study of the relations among moral language,
thought, reality, and knowledge) and, specifically, as a central
figure along with I. A. Richards and A. J. Ayer in the development of
emotivism. Emotivism, a precursor to the metaethical expressivism
today championed by Simon Blackburn (1984, 1993) and Alan Gibbard
(1990, 2003) among others, is typically understood as a theory of
moral language according to which ethical terms are used much like
exclamative and imperative sentences (‘Hooray!’, ‘Be
kind’) to express a speaker's affective, noncognitive
psychological states, such as approval or disapproval, rather than to
describe (or in addition to describing) some action, person,
institution, etc. Stevenson's emotivism, however, was more than a
theory of moral language.  Rather, it was but one part of a full-blown
ethical theory, grounded in moral and linguistic psychology, which was
intended to clarify the nature and structure of a whole range of
normative problems common to everyday life—ethical, aesthetic,
economic, legal, political, etc.—as well as the methods
typically used to resolve them. Throughout his work, Stevenson is
respectful of the complexity of human experience and the power of
signs and sounds to move a person emotionally and
behaviorally. Correspondingly, he is impatient with simplistic answers
to complex problems, the postulation of entities unverifiable by
scientific methods (e.g., non-naturalistic moral properties), and the
quest for exceptionless “first principles” of explanation
and justification that can be known with certainty.

Max Stirner (1806–1856) is best known as the author of the
idiosyncratic and provocative book entitled Der Einzige und sein
Eigenthum (1844).  Familiar in English as The Ego and Its
Own (a more literal translation would be The Unique
Individual and his Property), both the form and content of
Stirner's work are disconcerting. He challenges expectations about how
political and philosophical argument should be conducted, and seeks to
shake the reader's confidence in the moral and political superiority
of contemporary civilisation (over its historical predecessors). In
particular, he provides a sweeping attack on the modern world as
increasingly dominated by religious modes of thought and oppressive
social institutions, together with a much briefer sketch of a radical
‘egoistic’ alternative in which individual autonomy might
flourish. The historical impact of The Ego and Its Own is not
easy to assess. However, Stirner's book can certainly be said to have
had an immediate and destructive impact on contemporary

Stoicism,0.4877083897590637,0.2463357150554657,"

Stoicism was one of the new philosophical movements of the Hellenistic
period. The name derives from the porch (stoa poikilê)
in the Agora at Athens decorated with mural paintings, where the
members of the school congregated, and their lectures were held.
Unlike ‘epicurean,’ the sense of the English adjective
‘stoical’ is not utterly misleading with regard to its
philosophical origins. The Stoics did, in fact, hold that emotions
like fear or envy (or impassioned sexual attachments, or passionate
love of anything whatsoever) either were, or arose from, false
judgements and that the sage – a person who had attained moral and
intellectual perfection – would not undergo them. The later Stoics
of Roman Imperial times, Seneca and Epictetus, emphasise the doctrines
(already central to the early Stoics’ teachings) that the sage
is utterly immune to misfortune and that virtue is sufficient for
happiness. Our phrase ‘stoic calm’ perhaps encapsulates
the general drift of these claims. It does not, however, hint at the
even more radical ethical views which the Stoics defended, e.g. that
only the sage is free while all others are slaves, or that all those
who are morally vicious are equally so. (For other examples, see
Cicero’s brief essay ‘Paradoxa Stoicorum’.) Though
it seems clear that some Stoics took a kind of perverse joy in
advocating views which seem so at odds with common sense, they did not
do so simply to shock. Stoic ethics achieves a certain plausibility
within the context of their physical theory and psychology, and within
the framework of Greek ethical theory as that was handed down to them
from Plato and Aristotle. It seems that they were well aware of the
mutually interdependent nature of their philosophical views, likening
philosophy itself to a living animal in which logic is bones and
sinews; ethics and physics, the flesh and the soul respectively
(another version reverses this assignment, making ethics the soul).
Their views in logic and physics are no less distinctive and
interesting than those in ethics itself.

philosophical project involved an attempt to rethink pre-modern
philosophy, the impetus for this reconsideration and the philosophical
problems that vexed Strauss most were decidedly modern. Strauss
especially worried about the modern philosophical grounds for
political and moral normativity as well as about the philosophical,
theological, and political consequences of what he took to be modern
philosophy’s overinflated claims for the self-sufficiency of
reason.

Peter Frederick Strawson,0.6607526540756226,0.468646377325058,"


Peter Frederick Strawson (1919–2006) was an Oxford-based
philosopher whose career spanned the second half of the twentieth
century. He wrote most notably about the philosophy of language,
metaphysics, epistemology and the history of philosophy, especially
Kant.


Strawson's basic assumption is that we have no choice but to
employ the core concepts of common-sense, those of body, person, space
and time, causation, and also those of meaning, reference and truth.
Their applicability does not have to be earned by a reduction to a
supposedly more basic and secure realm of concepts, such as those of
experience as conceived of by the empiricists, or those of science.
There is no more basic or secure level of thought. He maintained, in
various ways, that sceptical challenges to these categories are
spurious and unwarranted. According to Strawson the proper task of
metaphysics is to describe these indispensible notions and their
interconnections. He opposed philosophical theories of language, such
as Russell's or Davidson's, as he interpreted it, which
overestimate the degree to which ordinary language is akin to formal
languages, and he also opposed sceptical attitudes to the notions of
meaning and truth along the lines developed by Quine and Dummett.
Within Oxford, Strawson contributed in a major way to the weakening of
Austin's influence and helped to re-establish there an engagement
with abstract philosophical questions. The range and quality of
Strawson's writings made him one of the major philosophers in the
period in which he lived, and his work still attracts considerable
attention.

Carl Stumpf,0.713817298412323,0.4867089092731476,"


The name Carl Friedrich Stumpf (1848–1936) is historically
associated with one of the most important philosophical currents in the
early twentieth century, phenomenology. Stumpf supervised
Husserl’s habilitation thesis in Halle in 1887 and the
latter’s seminal work on phenomenology, Logical
Investigations (1900–1901), is dedicated to him in recognition of
his friendship and his philosophical contribution to this book. Stumpf
is also known as the founder of the Berlin Institute of Psychology,
which gave birth to Gestalt psychology, another important current
during the early twentieth century and whose main adherents were among
others, his students W. Köhler, K. Koffka, W. Wertheimer and K.
Lewin. Founder of the Phonogram Archive in Berlin, now under the
protection of the UNESCO, he is also considered as one of the
forefathers of comparative musicology and a pioneer in ethnomusicology.
He held positions in the philosophy departments at the universities of
Göttingen, Würzburg, Prague, Munich and Halle, before
obtaining a professorship at the University of Berlin, where he was
also rector in 1907–1908. His two main sources of inspiration in
philosophy are Franz Brentano, of whom he was the first student in
Würzburg, and Hermann Lotze, who supervised his doctoral thesis on
Plato (1868) and his habilitation thesis on mathematical axioms (1870).
The philosophical work he left us is as original and as diversified as
his academic and institutional achievements. Besides many treatises in
the fields of acoustics and musicology, his important contributions to
the development of the “new psychology” and to the
philosophy of the mind in general should also be noted. His friend
William James said of him in his Principles of Psychology (p.
911) that he was “the most philosophical and profound of all
writers; and I owe him much.” His studies in the field of
descriptive psychology and phenomenology (known as the science of
phenomena) for example, are of particular interest to current research
in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive sciences.

Trained in Avicennan Peripateticism, Shihab al-Din al-Suhrawardi
(1154–1191) became the founder of an Illuminationist
(ishraqi) philosophical tradition in the Islamic East. Since
none of his works were translated into Latin, he remained unknown in
the West; but from the 13th century onwards, his works were
studied in a number of philosophical circles in the Islamic East. In
the mid-20th century, Henry Corbin worked relentlessly to
edit and study his writings, which led to renewed interest in
Suhrawardi's works and thought, especially in the later part of the
20th century.


Suhrawardi provided an original Platonic criticism of the dominant
Avicennan Peripateticism of the time in the fields of logic,
epistemology, psychology, and metaphysics, while simultaneously
elaborating his own epistemological (logic and psychology) and
metaphysical (ontology and cosmology) Illuminationist theories. His new
epistemological perspective led him to critique the Avicennan
Peripatetic theory of definition, introduce a theory of
‘presential’ knowledge, elaborate a complex ontology of
lights, and add a fourth ‘imaginal’ world.

Suicide,0.4955041706562042,0.9242813587188721,"

Throughout history, suicide has evoked an astonishingly wide range of
reactions—bafflement, dismissal, heroic glorification, sympathy,
anger, moral or religious condemnation—but it is never
uncontroversial. Suicide is now an object of multidisciplinary
scientific study, with sociology, anthropology, psychology, and
psychiatry each providing important insights into suicide.
Particularly promising are the significant advances being made in our
scientific understanding of the neurological and genetic bases of
suicidal behavior (Stoff and Mann 1997, Jamison 2000, Joiner 2010,
228–236) and the mental conditions associated with it.
Nonetheless, many of the most controversial questions surrounding
suicide are philosophical. For philosophers, suicide raises a host of
conceptual, moral, and psychological questions. Among these questions
are: What makes a person’s behavior suicidal? What motivates
such behavior? Is suicide morally permissible, or even morally
required in some extraordinary circumstances? Is suicidal behavior
rational? This article will examine the main currents of historical
and contemporary Western philosophical thought surrounding these
questions.

Supererogation,0.5406069159507751,0.6152729392051697,"


Supererogation is the technical term for the class of actions that go
“beyond the call of duty.” Roughly speaking,
supererogatory acts are morally good although not (strictly) required.
Although common discourse in most cultures allows for such acts and
often attaches special value to them, ethical theories have only
rarely discussed this category of actions directly and
systematically. A conspicuous exception is the Roman Catholic
tradition, which gave rise to the concept of supererogation, and the
virulent attacks on it by Lutherans and Calvinists. Surprisingly, the
history of supererogation in non-religious ethical theory is fairly
recent, starting only in 1958 with J. O. Urmson's seminal article,
“Saints and Heroes.”


The Latin etymology of “supererogation” is paying out more
than is due (super-erogare), and the term first appears in
the Latin version of the New Testament in the parable of the Good
Samaritan. Although we often believe that Good Samaritanism is
praiseworthy and non-obligatory at the same time, philosophical
reflection raises the question whether there can be any morally good
actions that are not morally required, and even if there are such
actions, how come they are optional or supererogatory. Thus, the
substantial literature on supererogation since the 1960s demonstrates
that even though the class of actions beyond duty is relatively small
and the philosophical attention paid to it is only recent, the status
of supererogation in ethical theory is important in exposing deep
problems about the nature of duty and its limits, the relationship
between duty and value, the role of ideals and excuses in ethical
judgment, the nature of moral reasons, and the connection between
actions and virtue. Supererogation raises interesting problems both on
the meta-ethical level of deontic logic and on the normative level of
the justification of moral demands.

Supervenience,0.8417233228683472,0.27458879351615906,"

A set of properties A supervenes upon another set B
just in case no two things can differ with respect to
A-properties without also differing with respect to their
B-properties. In slogan form, “there cannot be an
A-difference without a B-difference”.

As we shall see, this slogan can be cashed out in many different ways.
But to illustrate the basic idea, imagine that there is a perfect
forger. Her copies of paintings not only fool the art dealers, but are
in fact exact duplicates of the originals down to the precise
placement of every molecule of pigment—indeed, down to every
microphysical detail. Suppose that she produces such a copy of El
Greco’s A View of Toledo. It is of course different
from the original in various respects—it is a forgery, it was
not painted by El Greco, it is worth quite a bit less at
Sotheby’s, and so forth. But the forgery is also exactly
like the original in other respects. It is the same shape, size,
and weight. The surface of the canvas contains the same arrangements
of colors and shapes—a blue rectangle here, a green swirl there.
Indeed, it looks just the same, at least to a single viewer
under identical lighting conditions and so forth. Perhaps it is even
just as beautiful as the original, though that is more
controversial.

The properties that the forgery is guaranteed to share with the
original are those that supervene upon its microphysical properties.
Two paintings that are microphysically just alike are guaranteed to be
just alike in the arrangement of colors and shapes on their canvases.
That is, you cannot change the arrangement of colors and shapes on a
painting’s canvas without changing its microphysical properties.
This is just to say that the arrangement of colors and shapes
supervenes on its microphysical properties.

Supervenience is a central notion in analytic philosophy. It has been
invoked in almost every corner of the field. For example, it has been
claimed that aesthetic, moral, and mental properties supervene upon
physical properties. It has also been claimed that modal truths
supervene on non-modal ones, and that general truths supervene on
particular truths. Further, supervenience has been used to distinguish
various kinds of internalism and externalism, and to test claims of
reducibility and conceptual analysis.

Supervenience is related to but distinct from notions like grounding
and ontological dependence.  We directly address the relation between
these notions in §3.5 (much of that section has been part of this
entry since its initial publication in 2005).

Supervenience in Ethics,0.8417502641677856,0.27444636821746826,"
We sometimes think about the ethical significance of merely
possible circumstances. People sometimes wonder, for example, if it
would have been wrong to break certain promises that they in fact
kept. Examples like this do not exhaust the significance of
possibility—or modality more generally—in our ethical
thinking. Rather, we also seem to be committed to a certain modal
structure in our ethical commitments. To see this, consider an
example. Suppose that a bank manager wrongfully embezzles his
client’s money. If we imagine holding fixed how much the bank
manager stole, and how; the trust his customers placed in him; what he
did with the money; all of the short- and long-term consequences of
his actions; and so on, it seems that there could not be a second
action that perfectly resembled this embezzlement, except that the
second action was right rather than wrong. Cases like this one seem to
show a necessary connection: they suggest that the ethical
character of the bank manager’s act cannot vary without some
other facts varying as well.
While the embezzling bank manager example concerns a specific
necessary connection, many philosophers also find it plausible that
there are general necessary connections between ethical
properties and certain other properties. For example, many
philosophers have been inclined to accept:
Initial. There can be no ethical
difference between two possible states of affairs or actions without
there being some natural difference between them.
Following R. M. Hare (1952), claims of such general necessary
connection are called ethical supervenience theses. Such
theses have played a key role in arguments for and against a variety
of influential views about ethics. This entry aims to introduce the
idea of ethical supervenience and its philosophical significance. The
entry considers ways of making more precise the claim that the ethical
supervenes, and what case can be made for the supervenience of the
ethical. It then considers arguments that use ethical supervenience as
a premise, and doubts that ethical supervenience has the sort of
significance suggested by these arguments.

Alfred Tarski (1901–1983) described himself as “a mathematician (as
well as a logician, and perhaps a philosopher of a sort)” (1944,
p. 369). He is widely considered as one of the greatest logicians of
the twentieth century (often regarded as second only to Gödel),
and thus as one of the greatest logicians of all time.  Among
philosophers he is especially known for his mathematical
characterizations of the concepts of truth and logical consequence for
sentences of classical formalized languages, and to a lesser extent
for his mathematical characterization of the concept of a logical
constant for expressions of those same languages. Among logicians and
mathematicians he is in addition famous for his work on set theory,
model theory and algebra, which includes results and developments such
as the Banach-Tarski paradox, the theorem on the indefinability of
truth (see section 2 below), the completeness and decidability of
elementary algebra and geometry, and the notions of cardinal, ordinal,
relation and cylindric algebras. After a biographical sketch, this

Nicolaus Taurellus (b. 1547 Montbéliard, d. 1606 Altdorf) is
one of the early modern German philosophers who re-established
metaphysics as a topic of serious academic inquiry in the Lutheran
tradition. He adhered to the pious goal of providing a unified account
of philosophical and theological truth, but in doing so he developed a
series of controversial claims, such as the view that the basic
constituents of reality are immaterial, form-like entities. In
contrast to traditional form-matter composites, he maintained that
such form-like entities fulfill the criterion of
substantiality—the capacity of subsisting independently of other
entities. At the same time, he held that the composition of immaterial
entities can form only accidental, non-substantial unities. His
conclusion that human beings are only accidental, non-substantial
unities was perceived as a challenge to traditional views of
personhood. During his lifetime, Taurellus’s philosophy met
fierce opposition from orthodox Lutheran theologians. Still, his
metaphysics prefigures some basic ideas of the metaphysics of Leibniz,
who knew Taurellus‘s philosophy and thought highly of it.

Philosophy of Technology,0.5628188252449036,0.8857659101486206,"
If philosophy is the attempt “to understand how things in the
broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest
possible sense of the term”, as Sellars (1962) put it,
philosophy should not ignore technology. It is largely by technology
that contemporary society hangs together. It is hugely important not
only as an economic force but also as a cultural force. Indeed during
the last two centuries, when it gradually emerged as a discipline,
philosophy of technology has mostly been concerned with the impact of
technology on society and culture, rather than with technology
itself. Mitcham (1994) calls this type of philosophy of technology
‘humanities philosophy of technology’ because it is
continuous with social science and the humanities. Only recently a
branch of the philosophy of technology has developed that is concerned
with technology itself and that aims to understand both the practice
of designing and creating artifacts (in a wide sense, including
artificial processes and systems) and the nature of the things so
created. This latter branch of the philosophy of technology seeks
continuity with the philosophy of science and with several other
fields in the analytic tradition in modern philosophy, such as the
philosophy of action and decision-making, rather than with social
science and the humanities.
The entry starts with a brief historical overview, then continues
with a presentation of the themes that modern analytic philosophy of
technology focuses on. This is followed by a discussion of the
societal and ethical aspects of technology, in which some of the
concerns of humanities philosophy of technology are addressed. This
twofold presentation takes into consideration the development of
technology as the outcome of a process originating within and guided
by the practice of engineering, by standards on which only limited
societal control is exercised, as well as the consequences for society
of the implementation of the technology so created, which result from
processes upon which only limited control can be exercised.

Terrorism,0.3987619280815125,0.6906604766845703,"


Before the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September
2001, the subject of terrorism did not loom large in philosophical
discussion. Philosophical literature in English amounted to a few
monographs and a single collection of papers devoted solely, or
largely, to questions to do with terrorism. Articles on the subject in
philosophy journals were few and far between; neither of the two major
philosophy encyclopedias had an entry. The attacks of September 11 and
their aftermath put terrorism on the philosophical agenda: it is now
the topic of numerous books, journal articles, special journal issues,
and conferences.


While social sciences study the causes, main varieties, and
consequences of terrorism and history traces and attempts to explain
the way terrorism has evolved over time, philosophy focuses on two
fundamental—and related—questions. The first is
conceptual: What is terrorism? The second is moral: Can terrorism ever
be morally justified?


Philosophers have offered a range of positions on both questions.
With regard to the problem of defining terrorism, the dominant approach
seeks to acknowledge the core meaning “terrorism” has in
common use. Terrorism is understood as a type of violence. Many
definitions highlight the experience of terror or fear as the proximate
aim of that violence. Neither violence nor terror is inflicted for its
own sake, but rather for the sake of a further aim such as coercion, or
some more specific political objective. But there are also definitions
that sever the conceptual connection of terrorism with violence or with
terror. With regard to the moral standing of terrorism, philosophers
differ both on how that is to be determined and what the determination
is. Consequentialists propose to judge terrorism, like everything else,
in light of its consequences. Nonconsequentialists argue that its moral
status is not simply a matter of what consequences, on balance,
terrorism has, but is rather determined, whether solely or largely, by
what it is. Positions on the morality of terrorism range from
justification when its consequences on balance are good, or when some
deontological moral requirements are satisfied, to its absolute, or
almost absolute, rejection.


Philosophers working in applied philosophy have also sought to
complement the discussions of terrorism in general with case
studies—studies of the role and rights and wrongs of terrorism
in particular conflicts, such as “the Troubles” in
Northern Ireland (George 2000; Simpson 2004; Shanahan 2009), the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict (Gordon and Lopez 2000; Primoratz 2006;
Kapitan 2008; Law (ed.), 2008), and the bombing of German cities in

Given that speakers of a language sometimes assert falsehoods and
fail to be sincere, under what conditions, if any, is someone’s
word alone sufficient to justify the beliefs a hearer acquires from
those assertions? Of course, besides the word of the speaker, hearers
also causally depend on believing testimony on other fundamental
sources of knowledge like perception, memory, learning, and inference.
Can the reliability of testimony be justified by appeal to these
sources? This question represents the dominant epistemological problem
of testimony—is testimony an autonomous source of epistemic
authority? Reductionists answer negatively. They are opposed
by anti-reductionists who hold, characteristically on a
priori grounds, that testimony is a source of warrant in itself,
not reducible to warrant derived from these other sources, even if
empirically dependent on them.

In the ninth century, Plotinus was translated into Arabic. Long

the text to become an influential source of Neoplatonic ideas in the

not only as a conduit for Plotinus’ ideas; they also differ on
numerous points from their ultimate source. Thus the
Theology, along with other texts derived from the Arabic
version of Plotinus, in fact constitute an interpretation of
Plotinus’ thought, and not just a translation. The
Theology in turn becomes the chief text conveying Plotinian

Theoretical Terms in Science,0.8659891486167908,0.5906034111976624,"

A simple explanation of theoreticity says that a term is theoretical
if and only if it refers to nonobservational entities. Paradigmatic
examples of such entities are electrons, neutrinos, gravitational
forces, genes etc. There is yet another explanation of theoreticity: a
theoretical term is one whose meaning becomes determined through the
axioms of a scientific theory. The meaning of the term
‘force’, for example, is seen to be determined by
Newton’s laws of motion and further laws about special forces,
such as the law of gravitation. Theoreticity is a property that is
commonly applied to both expressions in the language of science, and
referents and concepts of such expressions. Objects, relations and
functions as well as concepts thereof may thus qualify as theoretical
in a derived sense.

Several semantics have been devised that aim to explain how a
scientific theory contributes to the interpretation of its theoretical
terms and as such determines what they mean and how they are
understood. All of these semantics assume the respective theory to be
given in an axiomatic fashion. Yet, theoretical terms are also
recognizable in scientific theories which have as yet resisted a
satisfying axiomatization. This is due to the fact that these theories
contain general propositions that have the logical form of universal
axioms. 

Theoretical terms pertain to a number of topics in the philosophy of
science. A fully fledged semantics of such terms commonly involves a
statement about scientific realism and its alternatives. Such a
semantics, moreover, may involve an account of how observation is
related to theory in science. All formal accounts of theoretical terms
deny the analytic-synthetic distinction to be applicable to the axioms
of a scientific theory. The recognition of theoretical terms in the
language of science by Carnap thus amounts to a rejection of an
essential tenet of early logical empiricism and positivism, viz., the
demonstration that all empirically significant sentences are
translatable into an observation language. The present article
explains the principal distinction between observational and
theoretical terms, discusses important criticisms and refinements of
this distinction and investigates two problems concerning the
semantics of theoretical terms. Finally, the major formal accounts of
this semantics are expounded.

Thomas of Erfurt,0.7266938090324402,0.23342017829418185,"


Thomas of Erfurt was the most influential member of a group of later
medieval philosophers known as the speculative grammarians or
Modistae (Modists), after the central place they assigned to
the modi significandi (modes of signification) of a word in
their analyses of human discourse. The notion that a word, once it has
been imposed to signify, carries with it all of its syntactical modes,
or possible combinations with other words, had been around since the
twelfth century. What the Modistae did was to posit the
origins of the modi significandi in terms of parallel
theories of modi intelligendi (modes of understanding) and
modi essendi (modes of being). The result was a curious
amalgam of philosophy, grammar, and linguistics. Thomas of Erfurt's
De modis significandi became the standard Modist textbook in
the fourteenth century, though it has since enjoyed even greater fame
later thanks to its misidentification as a work of Duns Scotus. The
text appeared in early printed editions of Scotus's Opera
Omnia, where it was read and commented upon by later figures such
as Charles S. Peirce and Martin Heidegger, whose 1916 doctoral thesis,
Die Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus, should
have been titled, Die Kategorienlehre des Duns Scotus und die
Bedeutungslehre des Thomas von Erfurt.

Henry David Thoreau,0.4926601052284241,0.3738356828689575,"

Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an American philosopher,
poet, and environmental scientist whose major work, Walden,
draws upon each of these identities in meditating on the concrete
problems of living in the world as a human being. He sought to revive
a conception of philosophy as a way of life, not only a mode of
reflective thought and discourse. Thoreau’s work was informed by
an eclectic variety of sources. He was well-versed in classical Greek
and Roman philosophy, ranging from the pre-Socratics through the
Hellenistic schools, and was also an avid student of the ancient
scriptures and wisdom literature of various Asian traditions. He was
familiar with modern philosophy ranging from Descartes, Locke and the
Cambridge Platonists through Emerson, Coleridge, and the German
Idealists, all of whom are influential on Thoreau’s philosophy.
He discussed his own scientific findings with leading naturalists of
the day, and read the latest work of Humboldt and Darwin with interest
and admiration. His philosophical explorations of self and world led
him to develop an epistemology of embodied perception and a
non-dualistic account of mental and material life. In addition to his
focus on ethics in an existential spirit, Thoreau also makes unique
contributions to ontology, the philosophy of science, and radical
political thought. Although his political essays have become justly
famous, his works on natural science were not even published until the
late twentieth century, and they help to give us a more complete
picture of him as a thinker. Among the texts he left unfinished was a
set of manuscript volumes filled with information on Native American
religion and culture. Thoreau’s work anticipates certain later
developments in pragmatism, phenomenology, and environmental
philosophy, and poses a perennially valuable challenge to our
conception of the methods and intentions of philosophy itself.

Thought Experiments,0.9233703017234802,0.5351879596710205,"


Thought experiments are devices of the imagination used to investigate
the nature of things. They are used for diverse reasons in a variety
of areas, including economics, history, mathematics, philosophy, and
the sciences, especially physics. Most often thought experiments are
communicated in narrative form, frequently with diagrams. Thought
experiments should be distinguished from thinking about experiments,
from merely imagining any experiments to be conducted outside the
imagination, and from psychological experiments with thoughts. They
should also be distinguished from counterfactual reasoning in general,
as they seem to require an experimental element, which seems to
explain the impression that something is experienced in a thought
experiment. In other words, though many call any counter-factual or
hypothetical situation a thought experiment, this seems too
encompassing.  It seems right to demand that they also be visualized
(or perhaps smelled, tasted, heard, touched); there should be
something experimental about a thought experiment. 


The primary philosophical challenge of thought experiments is simple:
How can we learn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking?
More precisely, are there thought experiments that enable us to
acquire new knowledge about the intended realm of investigation
without new empirical data? If so, where does the new information come from if
not from contact with the realm of investigation under
consideration? Finally, how can we distinguish good from bad instances
of thought experiments? These questions seem urgent with respect
to scientific thought experiments, because most philosophers and
historians of science “recognize them as an occasionally potent
tool for increasing our understanding of nature. […]
Historically their role is very close to the double one played by
actual laboratory experiments and observations. First, thought
experiments can disclose nature's failure to conform to a previously
held set of expectations. Second, they can suggest particular
ways in which both expectation and theory must henceforth be
revised.” (Kuhn, 1977, p. 241 and 261) The questions are urgent
regarding philosophical thought experiments, because they play an
important role in philosophical discourse. Philosophy without thought
experiments seems almost hopeless.
 There is widespread agreement that thought experiments play a
central role both in philosophy and in the natural sciences. General
acceptance of the importance of some of the well-known thought
experiments in the natural sciences, like Maxwell's demon, Einstein's
elevator or Schrödinger's cat. Probably more often than not,
these, and many other thought experiments have led the careful
analysis of their epistemic powers to the conclusion that we should
not portray science as an exclusively empirical activity (see
Winchester, 1990, p. 79).
 The 17th century saw some of its most brilliant practitioners in
Galileo, Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz. And in our own time, the
creation of quantum mechanics and relativity are almost unthinkable
without the crucial role played by thought experiments. Much of
ethics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind is based on the
results of thought experiments as well, including Searle's Chinese
room, Putnam's twin earth, and Jackson's Mary the colour
scientist. Philosophy, even more than the sciences, would be severely
impoverished without thought experiments, which suggests that a
unified theory of thought experiments is desirable to account for them
in both the sciences and the humanities (see Boniolo, 1997; Cooper,
2005, pp. 329–330; Gähde, 2000). That is to say: since the
sciences, especially physics, and philosophy both make use of thought
experiments, then, other things being equal, a unified account seems
desirable.
 There have been attempts to define “thought
experiment”, but likely it will be better to leave the term
loosely characterized, so as not to prejudice the ongoing
investigation. Of course, we need to have some idea as to what thought
experiments are to guide a proper philosophical analysis (see
Haggqvist, 2009), but this does not mean we need to begin with a
technical definition, specifying necessary and sufficient
conditions. In fact, many of the most important concepts we deal with
remain rather loosely defined when philosophical inquiry begins, e.g.,
religion or democracy. Luckily, there are plenty of examples to refer
to in order to circumscribe our subject matter well enough. As well as
those already mentioned, there are Newton's bucket, Heisenberg's
gamma-ray microscope, Einstein's elevator, Leibniz's mill, Parfit's
people who split like amoebas, and Thomson's violinist. Everyone is
probably familiar with some of these. Less familiar thought
experiments include “the dome”, a relatively new thought
experiment and probably the simplest example of indeterminism in
Newtonian physics. Imagine a mass sitting on a radially symmetric
surface in a gravitational field. Guided by Newton's laws of motion
one comes to realize that the mass can either remain at rest for all
times, or spontaneously move in an arbitrary direction (see Norton,
2008). This thought experiment triggers a number of very interesting
questions concerning the nature of Newtonian theory, the meaning of
“physical”, and the role of idealizations in physics. And,
of course, does it show what it claims? 


In the following we will first highlight some of the most common
features of thought experiments. A proposal follows for classifying
thought experiments, before reviewing the state of the debate on
thought experimenting, preceded by some remarks about the history of
philosophical inquiry into thought experiments. We conclude by
highlighting some of the recent developments surrounding the so-called
laboratory of the mind.

Tibetan Epistemology and Philosophy of Language,0.7394576668739319,0.3279831111431122,"


The birth of the Tibetan epistemological tradition (Tib. tshad
ma) follows the reception in Tibet of the central works on the
subject by the Indian Buddhist forefathers, principally
Dharmakīrti and his commentators. Tibetan epistemology evolved to
a large extent in the framework of a commentarial tradition, which did
not prevent it from developing into an indigenous system with its
specific terminology and formal features, a system that involves issues
that add to the themes inherited from the Indian tradition, at the core
of which is the discussion on “reliable cognition” (Skt.
pramāṇa, Tib. tshad ma). The present entry
focuses on questions linked with the theory of knowledge and the
philosophy of language, but the scope of Tibetan epistemological works
extends also to the domain of logic and argumentation and involves, as
Indian epistemological treatises do, discussions that relate to
religiously oriented themes, such as the question of scriptural
reliability, omniscience, etc.


The currently available works, written in Tibetan, range from the
11th c. to the present days. This abundant literature has
for the most part not been studied outside the Tibetan framework of
monastic studies; the majority of works has never been edited, only a
few are translated, sometimes only partially.


The Tibetan tradition is by no means monolithic. Although Tibetan
epistemologists address common themes of inquiry and can in part be
situated within lineages sharing tendencies of interpretation, the
individual compositions reveal a diversity that would make any attempt
at grouping them into rigid categories prone to oversimplification.


Individual entries will hopefully be devoted to the respective
thinkers in the future. This article will merely scratch the surface of
this rich tradition by sketching out some key topics of inquiry and
conflicting models representative of mainstream interpretative
orientations.

The Experience and Perception of Time,0.7191887497901917,0.39962297677993774,"


We see colours, hear sounds and feel textures. Some aspects of the
world, it seems, are perceived through a particular sense. Others,
like shape, are perceived through more than one sense. But what sense
or senses do we use when perceiving time? It is certainly not
associated with one particular sense. In fact, it seems odd to say
that we see, hear or touch time passing. And indeed, even if all our
senses were prevented from functioning for a while, we could still
notice the passing of time through the changing pattern of our
thought. Perhaps, then, we have a special faculty, distinct from the
five senses, for detecting time. Or perhaps, as seems more likely, we
notice time through perception of other things. But how?


Time perception raises a number of intriguing puzzles, including what
it means to say we perceive time. In this article, we shall
explore the various processes through which we are made aware of time,
and which influence the way we think time really is. Inevitably, we
shall be concerned with the psychology of time perception, but the
purpose of the article is to draw out the philosophical issues, and in
particular whether and how aspects of our experience can be
accommodated within certain metaphysical theories concerning the
nature of time and causation.

Thermodynamic Asymmetry in Time,0.9677518010139464,0.3941690325737,"

The thermodynamic time asymmetry is one of the most salient and
consequential features of the physical universe. Heat flows from hot
to cold, never the reverse. The smell of coffee spreads throughout its
available volume, never the reverse. Car engines convert fuel energy
into work and thermal energy, never the reverse. And so on. The
science of thermodynamics is able to capture these generalizations as
consequences of its claim that systems spontaneously evolve to future
equilibrium states but do not spontaneously evolve away from
equilibrium states. This generalization covers an amazing amount of
macroscopic physics and is rightly celebrated as one of the great laws
of physics.

Despite its familiarity, however, the thermodynamic arrow of time
raises many deep questions relevant to both philosophy and the
foundations of physics. This entry concentrates on two of them. In
contemporary parlance, they are each questions about grounding. (1)
What grounds the thermodynamic asymmetry in time? In a world possibly
governed at bottom by time-symmetric laws, how do the time-asymmetric
laws of thermodynamics arise? (2) Does the thermodynamic time
asymmetry ground any other temporal asymmetries? Does it account, for
instance, for the fact that we know more about the past than the
future? The discussion thus divides between thermodynamics being an
explanandum or explanans. What grounds the thermodynamic asymmetry,
and given the asymmetry, what does it ground?

Time Machines,0.8974258899688721,0.3720073699951172,"


Recent years have seen a growing consensus in the philosophical 
community that the grandfather paradox and similar logical puzzles do
not preclude the possibility of time travel scenarios that utilize 
spacetimes containing closed timelike curves. At the same time, 
physicists, who for half a century acknowledged that the general 
theory of relativity is compatible with such spacetimes, have 
intensely studied the question whether the operation of a time 
machine would be admissible in the context of the same theory and of 
its quantum cousins. A time machine is a device which brings about 
closed timelike curves—and thus enables time travel—where
none would have existed otherwise. The physics literature contains 
various no-go theorems for time machines, i.e., theorems which 
purport to establish that, under physically plausible assumptions, 
the operation of a time machine is impossible. We conclude that for 
the time being there exists no conclusive no-go theorem against time 
machines. The character of the material covered in this article makes
it inevitable that its content is of a rather technical nature. We 
contend, however, that philosophers should nevertheless be interested
in this literature for at least two reasons. First, the topic of time
machines leads to a number of interesting foundations issues in 
classical and quantum theories of gravity; and second, philosophers 
can contribute to the topic by clarifying what it means for a device 
to count as a time machine, by relating the debate to other concerns 
such as Penrose’s cosmic censorship conjecture and the fate of 
determinism in general relativity theory, and by eliminating a number
of confusions regarding the status of the paradoxes of time travel. 
The present article addresses these ambitions in as non-technical a 
manner as possible, and the reader is referred to the relevant 
physics literature for details.

thereby preventing your own existence. To avoid inconsistency some
circumstance will have to occur which makes you fail in this attempt to
kill your grandfather. Doesn't this require some implausible constraint
on otherwise unrelated circumstances? We examine such worries in the

Timon of Phlius,0.5706030130386353,0.2903820276260376,"


Timon (c. 320–230 BCE) was the younger contemporary and leading
disciple of
 Pyrrho
 of Elis. Unlike Pyrrho, he
wrote numerous poems and prose works; fragments of and reports on some
of these have survived, by far the largest number (more than sixty)
being from the Silloi (Lampoons). Several of these
works were devoted to, or at least included, laudatory descriptions of
Pyrrho and his philosophy; the Silloi appears to have
contained some passages in this vein, but consisted largely of
satirical thumbnail sketches of a wide range of other philosophers, all
of whom, in Timon's estimation, failed wholly or partly to achieve the
ideal outlook exemplified by Pyrrho. Despite the hazards of attempting
to extrapolate from this meager and highly colored material, it
constitutes much the best evidence we have for the character of
Pyrrho's thought. There is, however, some indication that Timon also
took stands on philosophical matters about which Pyrrho is unlikely to
have had anything to say. And even when he can be assumed to be
emulating Pyrrho's frame of mind, he may sometimes be expanding on or
adapting Pyrrho's original position rather than simply reporting it. He
should not, then, be regarded as a mere carbon copy of his teacher.

Torture,0.5149218440055847,0.6546088457107544,"

This entry is in four parts. The first part concerns the definition of
torture and addresses the question, what is torture? The second part
concerns the defining features of torture from a moral standpoint and
addresses the question, what makes torture inherently morally wrong?
For instance, it is generally held that torture is defined in part as
the deliberate infliction of extreme suffering and that – by virtue of
this defining feature – torture is morally wrong. Note that even
actions or practices that are inherently morally wrong might be
morally justified in extreme circumstances. Or to put things another
way, performing an evil action might be morally justified if
refraining from performing it constituted a much greater evil. Indeed,
the third part of the entry concerns just this possibility: the
possibility that notwithstanding its inherent moral wrongness, torture
might, nevertheless, in extreme emergencies be morally justified. In
short, the third part addresses the question, is torture morally
justified in extreme emergencies? The last part of the entry concerns
the legality, as opposed to the morality, of torture and addresses the
question,should torture ever be legalised or otherwise
 institutionalised?[1]

In relation to the definition of torture, there are now a number of
contemporary philosophical accounts on offer, notably those of Twining
& Paskins (1978), Davis (2005), Miller (2005), Sussman (2005),
Gross (2009) and Kamm (2011). Moreover, there are numerous detailed
discussions concerning the inherent moral wrongness of torture, all of
which focus on the extreme suffering inflicted (Bentham 1804; Shue
1978; Miller 2005 and 2009; Matthews 2008; Brecher 2008; Kershnar
2011), but some of which put greater emphasis on torture as a
violation of autonomy (Sussman 2005; Miller 2005). Useful collections
of essays on this and related topics are Levinson 2004, Greenberg et
al. 2005, Roth & Worden 2005, Rodin 2007, Allhoff 2008, Clucas et
al. 2009, Luban 2014 and Shue 2016.

The contemporary debate concerning the moral justifiability of torture
in extreme emergencies principally concerns the torture of terrorists
and is dominated by two groups. There are those who argue in the
affirmative and point to so-called ticking bomb scenarios to support
their case. These theorists often adhere to some form of
consequentialism, such as utilitarianism. They include Allhoff (2003,
2012), and Bagaric and Clarke (2007), albeit the classic utilitarian
justification remains that of Bentham (1804). (See also Twining &
Twining 1973.) Then there are those who argue in the negative and
stress not only the inherent immorality of torture but also contest
that it ever has good effects in practice (Davis 2005; Brecher 2008;
Matthews 2008). For instance, they typically claim that torture does
not work, since those who are tortured tell their torturers whatever
they want to hear.

The classic denunciation of the legalisation of torture is that of
Cesare Beccaria 1764. In the contemporary debate concerning the
legalisation of torture many theorists of a liberal persuasion have
stressed the incompatibility of torture with the values underpinning
liberal institutions (Luban 2005; Waldron 2005, 2010; Shue
2016). Moreover, in this contemporary debate, the protagonists have
tended to assume that if torture is morally justified in some extreme
emergencies then it ought to be legalised. Thus Alan Dershowitz claims
that torture is morally justified in some extreme emergencies and, in
the light of this claim, argues for torture warrants in these cases
(2003, 
 Chapter 4).[2] 
 See also Steinhoff 2006 and
2013. However, some theorists have argued that although torture can
in some extreme emergencies be morally justified, nevertheless,
torture ought never to be legalised or otherwise
institutionalised. This position was originally advanced by Machan
(1990) before being argued in more detail by Miller (2005) and (2009),
and later by McMahan (2008). 

Before proceeding to the question, or questions, of the moral
justifiability of torture in extreme emergencies we need some
understanding of what torture is. We also need some account of what is
inherently morally wrong with torture.

across the whole body using a variety of receptors in the skin. It

explore the world. Because of these unique features, touch raises many

Transcendental Arguments,0.6532650589942932,0.4605535864830017,"


As standardly conceived, transcendental arguments are taken to be
distinctive in involving a certain sort of claim, namely that
X is a necessary condition for the possibility
of Y—where then, given that Y is the case, it
logically follows that X must be the case too. Moreover,
because these arguments are generally used to respond to skeptics who
take our knowledge claims to be problematic, the Y in
question is then normally taken to be some fact about us or our mental
life which the skeptic can be expected to accept without question
(e.g., that we have experiences, or make certain judgements, or
perform certain actions, or have certain capacities, and so on),
where X is then something the skeptic doubts or denies (e.g.,
the existence of the external world, or of the necessary causal
relation between events, or of other minds, or the force of moral
reasons). In this way, it is hoped, skepticism can be overturned using
transcendental arguments that embody such transcendental claims.

At first sight, this anti-skeptical potential of such arguments makes
them seem powerful and attractive, by offering a proof of what
otherwise might seem to be known only through inductive reasoning or
fallible experience. However, as we shall see, transcendental arguments
conceived of in this ambitious form have struggled to live up to this
promise, though they still have their devotees. Nonetheless, the
potential for such arguments has been kept alive, by reassessing their
possible uses, where it has been suggested that they can perhaps be
given a more modest role, which then makes them more viable and enables
their apparent difficulties to be set aside. Whether this is indeed the
case, and whether even if it is this then leaves them denuded of their
anti-skeptical value and allure, remains an open question, and will be
discussed further below. We will also consider how far transcendental
arguments can serve a role not just in epistemology in defending our
claims to knowledge, but also in ethics, in persuading the skeptic of
the force of certain moral considerations and principles.

Transcendentalism is an American literary, political, and philosophical
movement of the early nineteenth century, centered around Ralph Waldo
Emerson. Other important transcendentalists were Henry David Thoreau,
Margaret Fuller, Amos Bronson Alcott, Frederic Henry Hedge, and
Theodore Parker. Stimulated by English and German Romanticism, the
Biblical criticism of Herder and Schleiermacher, and the skepticism of
Hume, the transcendentalists operated with the sense that a new era was
at hand. They were critics of their contemporary society for its
unthinking conformity, and urged that each person find, in
Emerson's words, “an original relation to the universe” (O, 3). Emerson
and Thoreau sought this relation in solitude amidst nature, and in
their writing. By the 1840s they, along with other transcendentalists,
were engaged in the social experiments of Brook Farm, Fruitlands, and
Walden; and, by the 1850s in an increasingly urgent critique of
American slavery.

Trinity,0.6139413118362427,0.2728722095489502,"

The traditional Christian doctrine of the Trinity is commonly
expressed as the statement that the one God exists as or in three
equally divine “persons”, the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Spirit. Every significant concept in this statement (God, exists,
as or in, equally divine, person) has been variously understood. The
guiding principle has been the creedal declaration that the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit of the New Testament are consubstantial (i.e. the
same in substance or essence, Greek: homoousios). Because
this shared substance or essence is a divine one, this is understood
to imply that all three named individuals are divine, and equally
so. Yet the three in some sense “are” the one God of the
Bible. 

After its formulation and imperial enforcement towards the end of the
fourth century, this sort of Christian theology reigned more or less
unchallenged. But before this, and again in post-Reformation modernity,
the origin, meaning, and justification of trinitarian doctrine has
been repeatedly disputed. These debates are discussed in supplementary
documents to this entry. One aspect of these debates concerns the
self-consistency of trinitarian theology. If there are three who are
equally divine, isn't that to say there are at least three gods? Yet
the tradition asserts exactly one God. Is the tradition, then,
incoherent, and so self-refuting? Since the revival of analytic
philosophy of religion in the 1960s, many Christian philosophers have
pursued what is now called analytic theology, in which central
religious doctrines are given formulations which are precise, and it
is hoped self-consistent and otherwise defensible. This article
surveys these recent “rational reconstructions” of the
Trinity doctrine, which centrally employ concepts from contemporary
analytic metaphysics, logic, and epistemology.

Trust,0.6913731098175049,0.7801089286804199,"


Trust is important, but it is also dangerous. It is important because
it allows us to form relationships with people and to depend on
them—for love, for advice, for help with our plumbing, or what
have you—especially when we know that no outside force compels
them to give us such things. But trust also involves the risk that
people we trust will not pull through for us; for, if there were some
guarantee that they would pull through, then we would have no
need to trust
 them.[1]
 Thus, trust is also dangerous. What we risk
while trusting is the loss of the things that we entrust to others,
including our self-respect, perhaps, which can be shattered by the
betrayal of our trust. 


Because trust is risky, the question of when it is warranted is of
particular importance. In this context, “warranted” means
justified or well-grounded (where well-grounded trust successfully
targets a trustworthy person). If trust is warranted in these senses,
then the danger of it is either minimized, as with justified trust, or
eliminated altogether, as with well-grounded trust. Leaving the danger
of trust aside, one could also ask whether trust is warranted in the
sense of being plausible. Trust may not be warranted in a particular
situation because it is simply not plausible: the conditions necessary
for it do not exist, as is the case when people feel only pessimism
toward one another. This entry on trust is framed as a response to the
general question of when or whether trust is warranted, where
“warranted” is broadly construed to include
“justified,” “well-grounded” and
“plausible.”


A complete philosophical answer to this question must explore the
various philosophical dimensions of trust, including the conceptual
nature of trust and trustworthiness, the epistemology of trust, the
value of trust, and the kind of mental attitude trust is. To
illustrate how each of these concerns is relevant, note that trust is
warranted, that is, 

Plausible, again, only if the conditions required for trust exist
(e.g. optimism about one another’s ability). Knowing what these
conditions are requires understanding the nature of trust. 
Well-grounded, only if the trustee is trustworthy, which makes
the nature of trustworthiness important in determining when trust is
warranted.
Justified, sometimes when the trustee is not in fact trustworthy,
which suggests that the epistemology of trust is relevant.
Justified, often because some value will emerge from the trust or
because it is valuable in and of itself. Thus, the value of trust is
important.
Plausible, only when it is possible for one to develop trust,
given one’s circumstances and the sort of mental attitude trust
is. For example, trust may not be the sort of attitude that one can
will oneself to have without any evidence of a person’s
trustworthiness.



This piece explores these different philosophical issues about
trust. It also deals predominantly with interpersonal trust, which I
take to be the dominant paradigm of trust. Although some philosophers
write about trust that is not interpersonal, including
“institutional trust” (i.e. trust in institutions; see
e.g. Potter 2002, Govier 1997, Townley and Garfield 2013), trust in government (Hardin 2002) or in artificial intelligence (which may only be person-like; see e.g. Coeckelbergh 2012, Taddeo and Floridi 2011), and
“self-trust” (Govier 1993, Lehrer 1997, Foley 2001, McLeod
2002, Goering 2009, Jones 2012b, Potter 2013), most would agree that these forms of
“trust” are coherent only if they share important features
of (i.e. can be modeled on) interpersonal trust. Hence, I assume that
the dominant paradigm is interpersonal.

Truth,0.8175333142280579,0.6500800251960754,"

Truth is one of the central subjects in philosophy. It is also one of
the largest. Truth has been a topic of discussion in its own right for
thousands of years. Moreover, a huge variety of issues in philosophy
relate to truth, either by relying on theses about truth, or implying
theses about truth.

It would be impossible to survey all there is to say about truth in
any coherent way. Instead, this essay will concentrate on the main
themes in the study of truth in the contemporary philosophical
literature. It will attempt to survey the key problems and theories of
current interest, and show how they relate to one-another. A number of
other entries investigate many of these topics in greater depth.
Generally, discussion of the principal arguments is left to them. The
goal of this essay is only to provide an overview of the current
Theories. Many of the papers mentioned in this essay can be found in
the anthologies edited by Blackburn and Simmons (1999) and Lynch
(2001b). There are a number of book-length surveys of the topics
discussed here, including Burgess and Burgess (2011), Kirkham (1992),
and Künne (2003). Also, a number of the topics discussed here,
and many further ones, are surveyed at more length in papers in
Glanzberg (2018).

The problem of truth is in a way easy to state: what truths are, and
what (if anything) makes them true. But this simple statement masks a
great deal of controversy. Whether there is a metaphysical problem of
truth at all, and if there is, what kind of theory might address it,
are all standing issues in the theory of truth. We will see a number
of distinct ways of answering these questions.

Axiomatic Theories of Truth,0.8594150543212891,0.7711636424064636,"
An axiomatic theory of truth is a deductive theory of truth as a
primitive undefined predicate. Because of the liar and other
paradoxes, the axioms and rules have to be chosen carefully in order
to avoid inconsistency. Many axiom systems for the truth predicate
have been discussed in the literature and their respective properties
been analysed. Several philosophers, including many deflationists, have endorsed axiomatic theories of truth in their
accounts of truth. The logical properties of the formal theories are
relevant to various philosophical questions, such as questions about
the ontological status of properties, Gödel’s theorems,
truth-theoretic deflationism, eliminability of semantic notions and
the theory of meaning.

The Coherence Theory of Truth,0.790415346622467,0.7263103127479553,"


A coherence theory of truth states that the truth of any (true)
proposition consists in its coherence with some specified set of
propositions. The coherence theory differs from its principal
competitor, the correspondence theory of truth, in two essential
respects. The competing theories give conflicting accounts of the
relation that propositions bear to their truth conditions. (In this
article, ‘proposition’ is not used in any technical sense.
It simply refers to the bearers of truth values, whatever they may
be.)  According to one, the relation is coherence, according to the
other, it is correspondence. The two theories also give conflicting
accounts of truth conditions. According to the coherence theory, the
truth conditions of propositions consist in other propositions. The
correspondence theory, in contrast, states that the truth conditions
of propositions are not (in general) propositions, but rather
objective features of the world. (Even the correspondence theorist
holds that propositions about propositions have propositions as their
truth conditions.) Although the coherence and correspondence theories
are fundamentally opposed in this way, they both present (in contrast
to deflationary theories of truth) a substantive conception of
truth. That is, unlike deflationary theories, the coherence and
correspondence theories both hold that truth is a property of
propositions that can be analysed in terms of the sorts of
truth-conditions propositions have, and the relations propositions
stand in to these conditions.

The Correspondence Theory of Truth,0.8159385323524475,0.6477299332618713,"


Narrowly speaking, the correspondence theory of truth is the view that
truth is correspondence to, or with, a fact—a view that was
advocated by Russell and Moore early in the 20th century. But the
label is usually applied much more broadly to any view explicitly
embracing the idea that truth consists in a relation to reality, i.e.,
that truth is a relational property involving a characteristic
relation (to be specified) to some portion of reality (to be
specified). This basic idea has been expressed in many ways, giving
rise to an extended family of theories and, more often, theory
sketches. Members of the family employ various concepts for the
relevant relation (correspondence, conformity, congruence, agreement,
accordance, copying, picturing, signification, representation,
reference, satisfaction) and/or various concepts for the relevant
portion of reality (facts, states of affairs, conditions, situations,
events, objects, sequences of objects, sets, properties, tropes). The
resulting multiplicity of versions and reformulations of the theory is
due to a blend of substantive and terminological differences.


The correspondence theory of truth is often associated with
metaphysical realism. Its traditional competitors, pragmatist, as well
as coherentist, verificationist, and other epistemic theories of
truth, are often associated with idealism, anti-realism, or
relativism. In recent years, these traditional competitors have been
virtually replaced (at least from publication-space) by deflationary
theories of truth and, to a lesser extent, by the identity theory
(note that these new competitors are typically not associated
with anti-realism). Still more recently, two further approaches have
received considerable attention. One is truthmaker theory: it is
sometimes viewed as a competitor to, sometimes as a more liberal
version of, the correspondence theory. The other is pluralism: it
incorporates a correspondence account as one, but only one, ingredient
of its overall account of truth.

The Deflationary Theory of Truth,0.817801833152771,0.6587470769882202,"


According to the deflationary theory of truth, to assert that a 
statement is true is just to assert the statement itself. For 
example, to say that ‘snow is white’ is true, or that it 
is true that snow is white, is equivalent to saying simply that snow 
is white, and this, according to the deflationary theory, is all that
can be said significantly about the truth of ‘snow is 
white’.


There are many implications of a theory of this sort for 
philosophical debate about the nature of truth. Philosophers often 
make suggestions like the following: truth consists in correspondence
to the facts; truth consists in coherence with a set of beliefs or 
propositions; truth is the ideal outcome of rational inquiry. 
According to the deflationist, however, such suggestions are 
mistaken, and, moreover, they all share a common mistake. The common 
mistake is to assume that truth has a nature of the kind 
that philosophers might find out about and develop theories of. For 
the deflationist, truth has no nature beyond what is captured in 
ordinary claims such as that ‘snow is white’ is true just
in case snow is white. Philosophers looking for the nature of truth 
are bound to be frustrated, the deflationist says, because they are 
looking for something that isn't there.


The deflationary theory has gone by many different names, including 
at least the following: the redundancy theory, the disappearance 
theory, the no-truth theory, the disquotational theory, and the 
minimalist theory. There is no terminological consensus about how to 
use these labels: sometimes they are used interchangeably; sometimes 
they are used to mark distinctions between different versions of the 
same general view. Here we will use ‘deflationism’, and 
‘the deflationary theory of truth’ to denote the general 
view we want to discuss, and reserve other names for specific versions
of that view.

The Identity Theory of Truth,0.7838532328605652,0.6170392632484436,"
The identity theory of truth was influential in the formative years
of modern analytic philosophy, and has come to prominence again
recently. Broadly speaking, it sees itself as a reaction against
correspondence theories of truth, which maintain that truth-bearers
are made true by facts. The identity theory maintains,
against this, that at least some truth-bearers are not made true by,
but are identical with, facts. The theory is not normally
applied at the level of declarative sentences, but to what such
sentences express. It is these items—or, again, some of
them—that are held to be identical with facts. Identity
theorists diverge over the details of this general picture, depending
on what exactly they take declarative sentences to express, whether
Fregean Thoughts (at the level of sense), Russellian propositions (at
the level of reference), or both, and depending also on how exactly
facts are construed. But, to give a precise illustration, an identity
theorist who thinks that declarative sentences express Russellian
propositions will typically hold that true such propositions are
identical with facts. The significance of the identity theory, for its
supporters, is that it appears to make available the closing of a
certain gap that might otherwise be thought to open up between
language and world and/or between mind and world. If its supporters
are right about this, the identity theory of truth potentially has
profound consequences both in metaphysics and in the philosophies of
mind and language.

The plausibility of theories of truth has often been observed to
vary, sometimes extensively, across different domains or regions of
discourse. Because of this variance, the problems internal to each such
theory become salient as they overgeneralize. A natural suggestion is
therefore that not all (declarative) sentences in all domains are true
in exactly the same way. Sentences in mathematics, morals, comedy,
chemistry, politics, and gastronomy may be true in different ways, if
and when they are ever true. ‘Pluralism about truth’ names
the thesis that there is more than one way of being true.

The Revision Theory of Truth,0.8545053601264954,0.7406604290008545,"


Consider the following sentence:



(1) is not true.
(1)





It has long been known that the sentence, (1), produces a paradox, the
so-called liar's paradox: it seems impossible consistently to
maintain that (1) is true, and impossible consistently to maintain
that (1) is not true: if (1) is true, then (1) says, truly, that (1)
is not true so that (1) is not true; on the other hand, if (1) is not
true, then what (1) says is the case, i.e., (1) is true. (For details,
see Section 1, below.) Given such a paradox, one might be sceptical of
the notion of truth, or at least of the prospects of giving a
scientifically respectable account of truth. 

Alfred Tarski's great accomplishment was to show how to give —
contra this scepticism — a formal definition of truth for a wide
class of formalized languages. Tarski did not, however, show
how to give a definition of truth for languages (such as
English) that contain their own truth predicates. He thought
that this could not be done, precisely because of the liar's
paradox. More generally, Tarski reckoned that any language
with its own truth predicate would be inconsistent, as long as it
obeyed the rules of standard classical logic, and had the ability to
refer to its own sentences. As we will see in our remarks on Theorem
2.1 in Section 2.3, Tarski was not quite right: there are consistent
classical interpreted languages that refer to their own sentences and
have their own truth predicates. (This point originates in Gupta 1982
and is strengthened in Gupta and Belnap 1993.)

 Given the close connection between meaning and
truth, it is widely held that any semantics for a language
L, i.e., any theory of meaning for L, will be
closely related to a theory of truth for L: indeed, it is
commonly held that something like a Tarskian theory of truth for
L will be a central part of a semantics for L. Thus,
the impossibility of giving a Tarskian theory of truth for languages
with their own truth predicates threatens the project of giving a
semantics for languages with their own truth predicates.


We had to wait until the work of Kripke 1975 and of Martin &
Woodruff 1975 for a systematic formal proposal of a semantics for
languages with their own truth predicates. The basic thought is
simple: take the offending sentences, such as (1), to be neither
true nor false. Kripke, in particular, shows how to implement
this thought for a wide variety of languages, in effect employing a
semantics with three values, true, false and
 neither.[1]
 It is safe to
say that Kripkean approaches have replaced Tarskian pessimism as the
new orthodoxy concerning languages with their own truth
predicates.

 
One of the main rivals to the three-valued semantics is the Revision
Theory of Truth, or RTT, independently conceived by Hans Herzberger
and Anil Gupta, and first presented in publication in Herzberger 1982a
and 1982b, Gupta 1982 and Belnap 1982 — the first monographs on
the topic are Yaqūb 1993 and the locus classicus, Gupta
& Belnap 1993. The RTT is designed to model the kind of reasoning
that the liar sentence leads to, within a two-valued
context. (See Section 5.2 on the question of whether the RTT is
genuinely two-valued.) The central idea is the idea of a revision
process: a process by which we revise hypotheses about
the truth-value of one or more sentences. The present article's
purpose is to outline the Revision Theory of Truth. We proceed as
follows:
",https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-revision/,,Knowledge
Truthlikeness,0.8664005994796753,0.5486252903938293,"

Truth is widely held to be the constitutive aim of
inquiry. Even those who think the aim of inquiry is something more
accessible than the truth (such as the empirically discernible truth),
as well as those who think the aim is something more robust than
possessing truth (such as the possession of knowledge) still affirm
truth as a necessary component of the end of inquiry. And, other
things being equal, it seems better to end an inquiry by endorsing
truths rather than falsehoods.
Even if there is something to the thought that inquiry aims at
truth, it has to be admitted that truth is a rather coarse-grained
property of propositions. Some falsehoods seem to realize the aim of
getting at the truth better than others. Some truths better realize
the aim than other truths. And perhaps some falsehoods even realize
the aim better than some truths do. The dichotomy of the class of
propositions into truths and falsehoods needs to be supplemented with
a more fine-grained ordering — one which classifies propositions
according to their closeness to the truth, their degree
of truthlikeness, or their verisimilitude.


We begin with the logical problem of truthlikeness: the problem of
giving an adequate account of the concept and determining its logical
properties.  In §1 we lay at the logical problem and various
possible solutions to it.  In §1.1 we examine the basic
assumptions which generate the logical problem, which in part explain
why the problem emerged when it did. Attempted solutions to the
problem quickly proliferated, but they can be gathered together under
three broad lines of attack. The first two, the content
approach (§1.2) and the consequence approach
(§1.3), were both initiated by Popper in his ground-breaking work
and both deliver what he regarded as an essential desideratum for any
theory of truthlikeness — what we will call the value of
content for truths. Although Popper's specific proposals did not
capture the intuitive concept, the content and consequence approaches
are still being actively developed and refined. The third,
the likeness approach (§1.4), takes the likeness
in truthlikeness seriously.  Assuming likeness relations among
worlds, the likeness of a proposition to the truth would seem to be
some function of the likeness of worlds that make the proposition true
to the actual world. The main problems facing the likeness approach
are outlined in §1.4.1 –§1.4.4.
 Given that there are at least three different approaches to the
logical problem, a natural question is whether there might be a way of
combining the different desiderata that motivate them (§1),
thereby incorporating the most desirable features of each. Recent
results suggest that unfortunately the three approaches, while not
logically incompatible, cannot be fruitfully combined.  Any attempt to
unify these approaches will have to jettison or radically modify at
least one of the motivating desiderata.
There are two further problems of truthlikeness, both of which
presuppose the solution of the logical problem. One is
the epistemological problem of truthlikeness (§2).  Even
given a suitable solution to the logical problem, there remains a
nagging question about our epistemic access to truthlikeness.  The
other is the axiological problem.  Truth and truthlikeness are
interesting, at least in part because they appear to be cognitive
values of some sort.  Even if they are not cognitively valuable
themselves, they are closely connected to what is of cognitive
value. The relations between truth, truthlikeness and cognitive value
are explored in §3.

Truthmakers,0.8130010366439819,0.6366230249404907,"


This much is agreed: “x makes it true that p”
is a construction that signifies, if it signifies anything at all, a
relation borne to a truth-bearer by something else, a truth-maker. But
it isn't generally agreed what that something else might be, or
what truth-bearers are, or what the character might be of the
relationship that holds, if it does, between them, or even whether such
a relationship ever does hold. Indeed sometimes there's barely
enough agreement amongst the parties to the truth-maker dispute for
them to be disagreeing about a common subject matter. This makes
navigating the literature about truth-makers a treacherous undertaking
but a necessary one because of the significance the debate about
truth-makers bears for contemporary metaphysics.


We can distinguish between the following questions that different
approaches to truth-makers have been framed to answer:

(1) What is it to be a truth-maker?
(2) Which range, or ranges, of truths are eligible to be made
true (if any are)?
(3) What kinds of entities are truth-makers?
(4) What is the motivation for adopting a theory of
truth-makers?



These questions cannot be addressed in isolation from one another.
Our thinking about what it is to be a truth-maker will likely have
knock-on effects for how we answer the second and third questions. Our
beliefs about which truths have truth-makers will likely shape our
answer to the first and third. And the theoretical benefits that we
think will come our way from positing truth-makers in the first place
will no doubt exert a controlling influence upon our responses to the
other questions. But since the first is, in a significant sense, prior
to the rest—otherwise it's unclear what we're talking
about—I will start out by addressing, at least in a preliminary
way, the issue of what it is to be a truth-maker.


The notion of a truth-maker, like that of a clapping hand, cannot
ultimately be understood in isolation from the notion of what it makes
true, the other hand with which it claps, a truth-bearer. There are a
variety of different candidate fillers for the role of
truth-bearers—sentence tokens, judgements, propositions
etc—and very often discussion of truth-makers and
truth-making proceeds without an eye to which candidate best fills this
role. This is understandable: metaphysicians are typically interested
in what there is rather than representations thereof. But truth-bearers
are the elephant in the room during these discussions. Eventually
we'll have to talk about them because what we think about
truth-bearers will have consequences for what we think about
truth-makers. So there's a further question that we can't
put off answering indefinitely,

(5) What are the truth-bearers?



For the time being I'll remain relatively non-committal about
the character of truth-bearers except for making the minimal assumption
that truth-bearers are inherently representational in character. But
eventually the issue will become unavoidable.


I will not dwell upon the history of the concept
truth-maker. Anticipations of the contemporary use of the
concept have been found in Aristotle and Suarez (Fox 1987; Künne
2003: 150–4; Schmutz 2007), Leibniz (Armstrong 1997: 14;
Mulligan 2009: 39–42), Russell and Wittgenstein (Hochberg 1978;
Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984: 287–9, 308–12; Simons
1992: 156–61; Künne 2003: 118–226, 145–8),
Stout, McTaggart and Pfänder (Mulligan 2009). But it has also
been disputed whether these authors are really deploying the concept
of truth-making with which we are familiar rather than
employing, perhaps for reasons of grammatical convenience,
superficially similar turns of phrase that make it sound as if they
are expressing our concept (Dodd 2002: 81–3; MacBride 2005:
137–9; Glock 2007).

Truth Values,0.8582470417022705,0.8256513476371765,"

Truth values have been put to quite different uses in philosophy and
logic, being characterized, for example, as:

primitive abstract objects denoted by sentences in natural and
formal languages, 
abstract entities hypostatized as the equivalence classes of
sentences, 
what is aimed at in judgements, 
values indicating the degree of truth of sentences, 
entities that can be used to explain the vagueness of concepts,

values that are preserved in valid inferences, 
values that convey information concerning a given
proposition.


Depending on their particular use, truth values have been treated as
unanalyzed, as defined, as unstructured, or as structured
entities.

The notion of a truth value has been explicitly introduced into logic
and philosophy by Gottlob Frege—for the first time in Frege
1891, and most notably in his seminal paper (Frege 1892). Although it
was Frege who made the notion of a truth value to one of the central
concepts of semantics, the idea of special semantical values, however,
was anticipated by Boole and Peirce already, see the survey article on
a “history of truth values” by Béziau (2012).
According to Kneale and Kneale (1962: 413), Boole’s system
contains all that is needed for its interpretation “in terms of
truth values of propositions”, and as Church (1956: 17) remarks,
the “explicit use of two truth-values appears for the first time
in a paper by C.S. Peirce in the American Journal of
Mathematics, vol. 7 (1885), pp. 180–202”. Frege
conceived this notion as a natural component of his language analysis
where sentences, being saturated expressions, are interpreted as a
special kind of names, which refer to (denote, designate, signify) a
special kind of objects: truth values. Moreover, there are, according
to Frege, only two such objects: the True (das
Wahre) and the False (das Falsche):

Every assertoric sentence … is to be regarded as a proper name,
and its Bedeutung, if it has one, is either the True or the
False. (Frege 1892, trans. Beaney 1997: 158)


This new and revolutionary idea has had a far reaching and manifold
impact on the development of modern logic. It provides the means to
uniformly complete the formal apparatus of a functional analysis of
language by generalizing the concept of a function and introducing a
special kind of functions, namely propositional functions, or truth
value functions, whose range of values consists of the set of truth
values. Among the most typical representatives of propositional
functions one finds predicate expressions and logical connectives. As
a result, one obtains a powerful tool for a conclusive implementation
of the extensionality principle (also called the principle of
compositionality), according to which the meaning of a complex
expression is uniquely determined by the meanings of its components.
On this basis one can also discriminate between extensional and
intensional contexts and advance further to the conception of
intensional logics. Moreover, the idea of truth values has induced a
radical rethinking of some central issues in the philosophy of logic,
including: the categorial status of truth, the theory of abstract
objects, the subject-matter of logic and its ontological foundations,
the concept of a logical system, the nature of logical notions,
etc.

In the following, several important philosophical problems directly
connected to the notion of a truth value are considered and various
uses of this notion are explained.

Tsongkhapa,0.44165855646133423,0.3214751482009888,"

Tsongkhapa (1357–1419) is a well-known Tibetan religious
philosopher. In his iconic form, wearing a tall yellow hat, he is the
center of the Gelugpa (Tib. dge lugs pa) sect that was
dominant in Tibet until the Chinese takeover in 1951, and whose de
facto leader is the Dalai Lama.

The historical Tsongkhapa flourished in the period immediately
following the final redaction of the Buddhist canon in Tibetan
translation (Tib. bKa' 'gyur, pronounced Kanjur). He
propounds a distinctive Middle Way (Sk. madhyamaka, Tib.
dbu ma pa) philosophy by differentiating between
Candrakīrti's (fl. ca. 600) correct Consequentialist (Tib.
thal 'gyur pa, Sk. *prāsaṅgika)
interpretation of the works of the Indian philosopher
Nāgārjuna (third-fourth century), and an incorrect
Autonomist (Tib. rang rgyud pa, Sk.
*svātantrika) interpretation by Bhāviveka (also
known as Bhavya and Bhāvaviveka, fl. ca. 550). He is strongly
influenced by the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist logico-epistemological
tradition (Sk. pramāṇa, Tib. tshad ma)
founded by the Indian epistemologists Dignāga and
Dharmakīrti (fifth to seventh century). Tsongkhapa strikes a
balance between knowledge and praxis. He says the emptiness of
intrinsic existence (Sk. svabhāvaśūnyatā,
Tib. rang bzhin gyis stong pa nyid) is the ultimate truth
(Sk. paramārtha-satya), and says even that is only true
conventionally. At the same time he develops a hermeneutics to retain
the authority of correct moral statements on a covering (Sk.
saṃvṛti) or conventional (Sk.
vyavahāra) level. His most influential writing
reconciles the philosophy of emptiness with the imperative of praxis
embodied in a universal altruistic principle (Sk.
bodhicitta). He gives pride of place to apparently antinomian
tantric praxis without devaluing the centrality of ordinary moral
life, and develops a distinctive analysis of dependent origination
(Sk. pratītya-samutpāda) to support his assertion
that entities are both conventional and ultimate truths.

his 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” is one of the
most frequently cited in modern philosophical literature. It gave a
fresh approach to the traditional mind-body problem, by relating it to
the mathematical concept of computability he himself had introduced in
his 1936–7 paper “On computable numbers, with an application to the
Entscheidungsproblem.” His work can be regarded as the foundation of
computer science and of the artificial intelligence program.

Turing Machines,0.9460353851318359,0.6729925870895386,"


Turing machines, first described by 
 Alan Turing in (Turing 1937a),
are simple abstract computational devices intended to help investigate
the extent and limitations of what can be computed.


Turing was interested in the question of what it means for a task to
be computable, which is one of the foundational questions in the
 philosophy of computer science.
Intuitively a task is computable if it is possible to specify a sequence of
instructions which will result in the completion of the
task when they are carried out by some machine. Such a set of
instructions is called an effective procedure,
or algorithm, for the task. The problem with this intuition
is that what counts as an effective procedure may depend on the
capabilities of the machine used to carry out the instructions. In
principle, devices with different capabilities may be able to complete
different instruction sets, and therefore may result in different
classes of computable tasks (see the entry
on computability and complexity).


Turing proposed a class of devices that came to be known as Turing
machines. These devices lead to a formal notion of computation that we
will call Turing-computability. A task is Turing computable
if it can be carried out by some Turing machine.


The proposition that Turing's notion captures exactly the intuitive
idea of effective procedure is called the
  Church-Turing thesis.
This proposition is not provable, since it is a claim about the
relationship between a formal concept and intuition.  The thesis would
be refuted by an intuitively acceptable algorithm for a task that is
not Turing-computable, and no such counterexample has been
found. Other independently defined notions of computability based on
alternative foundations, such as
 recursive functions and
abacus machines have been shown to be equivalent to
Turing-computability. These two facts indicate that there is at least
something natural about this notion of computability.


Turing machines are not physical objects but mathematical ones. We
require neither soldering irons nor silicon chips to build one. The
architecture is simply described, and the actions that may be carried
out by the machine are simple and unambiguously specified. Turing
recognized that it is not necessary to talk about how the
machine carries out its actions, but merely to take as given the twin
ideas that the machine can carry out the specified actions, and that
those actions may be uniquely described.

Kazimierz Twardowski,0.7332059741020203,0.5019145607948303,"

Kazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938) was an Austrian-born Polish
philosopher. He was a student of
 Franz Brentano
 and the founder of the
 Lvov-Warsaw School.
 His main work, On the Content and Object of Presentations
(1894), established the need for the distinction between the content
and the object of a presentation within Brentanian theories of the
intentionality of mental acts. The distinction is a psychological,
non-platonistic counterpart of Frege's distinction between sense and
reference. Other students of Brentano, notably Edmund Husserl and
Alexius Meinong, integrated the distinction between content and object
in their works after the appearance of Twardowski's book. Twardowski
spoke of contradictory objects before Meinong: he was the first
philosopher to hold a theory of intentionality, truth, and predication
in which thinking and speaking about non-existents, including
contradictions, involves presenting and naming non-existents,
including contradictory objects. Like Meinong, Twardowski belonged to
a tradition of non-idealistic German-language philosophy that
originated with Bernard Bolzano, and that influenced, via G. F. Stout,
Moore and Russell's transition from idealism to analytic philosophy.
After moving to Lvov (now Lviv) in 1895, Twardowski devoted himself to
establishing a tradition of scientific, i.e. rigorous and exact
philosophy in Poland inspired by Brentano's views rather than to
publishing his own ideas. As a result, his published oeuvre,
written in Polish and German, is relatively small. Twardowski's
unpublished manuscripts, often complete sets of lecture notes,
constitute a considerable part of his philosophical corpus. According
to Roman Ingarden, assessments of Twardowski's achievements and his
role in history should be considered incomplete and hypothetical as
long as they are based only on his published writings (Ingarden 1948,
18). Important projects for the edition and dissemination of
Twardowski's manuscript material have been recently completed or are
currently ongoing in Austria, France, Poland, Italy, and the
 Netherlands.[1]

Twardowski was a sharp thinker and a writer of exemplary clarity. He
wrote on signs, on meaning and reference, and on indexicality and
truth, defending a non-platonistic view of time-independent truth; he
wrote on the metaphysics of parts and wholes, on ethics, on the
history of philosophy, on the relation between philosophy and
psychology, and, importantly, on metaphilosophy. In Twardowski's times
psychology was divided roughly in two camps: ‘Wundtian’
experimental psychology and ‘Brentanian’ descriptive
pyschology (see the entries on
 Wundt
 and
 Brentano);
 although Twardowski sided mainly with Brentano's way of looking at
psychology, he lectured on themes from experimental psychology such as
optical illusion and established the first laboratory of empirical
psychology in Poland. He developed a judgment-based theory of
knowledge, and he valued analysis as a fruitful method in philosophy.
This notwithstanding, it is a widespread convinction that Twardowski's
most tangible success remains his extraordinary work as educator and
initiator of philosophical activities in Poland. Indeed, Twardowski
was a talented teacher, like Brentano, and he exerted, through his
teaching, a powerful influence on generations of young Polish
philosophers, such as Jan Łukasiewicz, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz,
Stanisław Leśniewski (who, in turn, taught Alfred Tarski)
and Tadeusz Kotarbiński. This influence regarded first of all
matters of method: Twardowski laid emphasis on ‘small
philosophy’, namely on the detailed, systematic analysis of
specific problems—including problems from the history of
philosophy—characterised by rigor and clarity, rather than on
the edification of whole philosophical systems and comprehensive
world-views.

The Theory of Two Truths in India,0.4544303715229034,0.3291378617286682,"

The theory of the two truths has a twenty-five century long history
behind it. It has its origin in the sixth century
 BCE[1]
 India with the emergence of the Siddhārtha Gautama. It is said,
according to the Pitāpūtrasamāgama-sūtra,
Siddhārtha became a buddha “awakened one” because he
fully understood the meaning of the two truths—conventional
truth (saṁvṛti-satya) and ultimate truth
(paramārtha-satya)—and that the reality of all the objects
of knowledge, the text says, is exhaustively comprised of the two
truths (Sde Dge, dkon brtsegs nga, 60b). The theory of the
two truths, according to the
Samādhirāja-sūtra, is a unique contribution
made by the Buddha towards Indian philosophy. This text states:
“the knower of the world, without hearing it from others, taught
that there are the two truths” (Sde dge, mdo-sde da
174b–210b). Nāgārjuna, in his
Mūlamadhyamakakārikā [MMK], attributes the two
truths to the Buddha as follows: “the Dharma taught by the
buddhas is precisely based on the two truths: a truth of mundane
conventions and a truth of the ultimate” ([MMK] 24:8).

The Madhyamaka philosophers claim the theory of the two truths is the
heart of the Buddha's philosophy. According to them it serves as the
mirror reflecting the core message of the Buddha's teachings and the
massive philosophical literature it inspired. At the heart of the
theory of the two truths is the Buddha's ever poignant existential and
soteriological concerns about the reality of things and of life.
Nirvāṇa, ultimate freedom from the suffering conditioned by
desires, is only ever achieved, according to the theory of the two
truths, from a correct understanding of two truths. Knowledge of the
conventional truth informs us how things are conventionally, and thus
grounds our epistemic practice in its proper linguistic and conceptual
framework. Knowledge of the ultimate truth informs us of how things
really are ultimately, and so takes our minds beyond the bounds of
conceptual and linguistic coventions.

In theory of the two truths, as we know it today, may be unknown to
the earliest start of Buddhist thought in India. Contemporary
scholarship suggests that the Buddha himself may not have made any
explicit reference to the two truths. The early textual materials such
as Pali Nikāyas and āgamas ascribe to the Buddha does not
make explicit mention of the distinction of the two truths. Recent
studies also suggest that the two truths distinction is an innovation
on the part of the Abhidhamma which came into prominence originally as
a heuristic device useful for later interpreters to reconcile apparent
inconsistent statements in the Buddha's teachings (Karunadasa, 2006:
1; 1996: 25-6 and n.139, The Cowherds, 2011; 5). This distinction is
however not entirely disconnected from the Buddha's teachings. The
antecedent hermeneutic distinctions drawn in the Aṅguttara
Nikāya (AN II.60) between two linguistic concepts
(paññatti) – nitattha (Skt.
nitārtha) and neyyatta (Skt. neyārtha)
– provides us a useful insight into the rationale basis from
which later develops the formulation of the two truths distinction.
This latter pair of terms deals with the hermeneutic strategies
explaining the purported meaning of the Buddhist scriptural
statements. Nitattha is a statement the meaning of which is ""drawn
out"" (nita-attha), definitive and explicit, taken as its
stands, and neyyattha is a statement the meaning of which is ""to be
drawn out"" (neyya-attha) and interpretive (Karunadasa, 1996:
25). The commentary (Aṅguttaranikāya Aṭṭhakatah
II.118) on the Aṅguttara Nikāya II.60 explores
nitattha/neyyattha distinction's connection with the
sammuti/paramattha distinction. This simple heuristic device however
stimulated rich philosophical exchanges amongst the Buddhist
philosophers and practitioners, not to mention the exchanges with
traditional Hindu thinkers. The exchange of different ideas and views
of the two truths between the early Buddhists, among other factors,
gave birth to Buddhism as the philosophy we know today. The
transformation of the two truths theory from a simple hermeneutic
strategy to a complex system of thought with highly sophisticated
ontological, epistemological and semantic theories blurring a clear
methodological distinction between ""reality"" and ""truth"". As always
two terms – reality and truth – are expressed with one
Sanskrit term satya; often reality/truth are seen as having an
interchangeable usage and meaning. This philosophical development is
perhaps the most significant contribution resulting from the schisms
the Buddhism experienced after the Buddha passed away (ca. 380 BCE).
Various schools with varying interpretations of the Buddha's words
soon appeared in Buddhism, which resulted in rich and vibrant
philosophical and hermeutic atmosphere.

In later years, Sarvāstivādin (Vaibhāṣika) and
Sautrāntika, Madhyamaka (from the first century CE onwards) and
Yogācāra (ca. sixth century CE onwards) became the dominant
schools. Our investigation of the theory of the two truths will
briefly focus on how these schools have received, interpreted and
understood it. Although all these schools regard the theory of two
truths as the centrepiece of the Buddha's philosophy, all have
nevertheless adopted very different approaches to the theory. As we
shall see each understood and interpreted the two truths in different
ways, and are often fundamentaly and radically opposed to each
other.

The Theory of Two Truths in Tibet,0.4516248106956482,0.3239901661872864,"

Tibetan philosophers argue that the two truths theory is not only core
ontological doctrine as it is understood within the Indian Buddhist
thought, it also makes the central theory behind epistemology and
soteriology. The Indian Buddhist schools are named after the theories
of the two truths they each upheld as in the entry on the
 theory of the two truths in India.
 The same cannot be said about the schools of thought in Tibet. All
Tibetan philosophers and the
 schools[1]—Nyingma,
 Kagyü, Sakya, and Gelug—they established are
self-confessed followers of the Prāsaṅgika Madhyamaka
school of thought, and follow Candrakīrti closely. Tibetans agree
that Candrakīrti is the undisputed authority in commenting and
interpreting Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka theory of the two
truths. The Tibetan Prāsaṅgikas however disagreed, debated
and fought fiercely amongst themselves concerning many philosophical
questions. Who is the Prāsaṅgika? Does the
Prāsaṅgika hold any position? What is it that constitutes
the Prāsaṅgika's core philosophical position? How should
Candrakīrti's hermeneutic approach towards Nāgārjuna be
assessed, evaluated and interpreted? The debate amongst the Tibetan
philosophers stems on a large part from the way in which they each
differently interpreted and understood Candrakīrti's theory of
the two truths and its philosophical implications. The parameters
within which this debate is conducted either in the monastic debate
courtyards or in their philosophical writings, took a form around
certain philosophical themes. Those themes later became the standard
paradigmatic focus of any discussion on the subject of the two
truths.

Basis of the division: What is divided into the two truths?
Etymological analysis (sgra bshad) of the two truths
Definition (mtshan nyid / nges tshig) of the two truths:
Subjective or objective?
Enumeration (grangs nges): Is there one or two truths?
Classification (rab dbye): Are there many types of conventional
truth or one?
Relation: Are the two truths distinct or identical?


Keeping with the Tibetan Madhyamaka traditions, the present essay on
the theory of the two truths in Tibet focuses on the philosophical
issues arising from and associated with these themes. Therefore our
concern in this article is not historical evolution of the schools, or
the philosophers and the ideas to which they each are associated, our
concern is rather, first and foremost philosophical.

Church's Type Theory,0.8983563780784607,0.7593850493431091,"


Church's type theory is a formal logical language which includes
 first-order logic,
 but is more
expressive in a practical sense. It is used, with some modifications
and enhancements, in most modern applications of type theory. It is
particularly well suited to the formalization of mathematics and
other disciplines and to specifying and verifying hardware and
software.  
It also plays an important role in the
study of the formal semantics of natural language.


A great wealth of technical knowledge can be expressed
very naturally in it.  With possible enhancements, Church's type
theory constitutes an excellent formal language for representing the
knowledge in automated information systems, sophisticated 
 automated reasoning systems, systems
 for
verifying the correctness of mathematical proofs, and certain projects
 involving
 logic and artificial intelligence.
 Some examples are given in Section 1.2.2 below.


Type theories are also called higher-order logics, since they allow
quantification not only over individual variables (as in first-order
logic), but also over function, predicate, and even higher order
variables.  Type theories characteristically assign types to entities,
distinguishing, for example, between numbers, set of numbers,
functions from numbers to sets of numbers, and sets of such functions.
As illustrated in Section 1.2.2 below, these distinctions allow one to
discuss the conceptually rich world of sets and functions without
encountering the paradoxes of naive set theory.


Church's type theory is a formulation of 
 type theory
 that was introduced by Alonzo Church in Church 1940. In certain
respects, it is simpler and more general than the type theory
introduced by
 Bertrand Russell
 in Russell 1908 and Whitehead & Russell 1927a. Since
properties and relations can be regarded as functions from entities to
truth values, the concept of a function is taken as primitive in
Church's type theory, and the λ-notation which Church
introduced in Church 1932 and Church 1941 is incorporated into the formal
language.

Umar Khayyam was a polymath, scientist, philosopher, and poet of

area of study. In what follows, we shall review and comment on the
salient features of Khayyam’s poetry and philosophy, their
relationship with one another, and Khayyam’s pioneering views on
mathematics.



Traditionally, Umar Khayyam’s significance in the annals

Rubā‘iyyāt (quatrains) and his scientific works,

been overshadowed by his poetry. In recent years, critical
editions of the philosophical works of Khayyam have been published

thought but also provide a context for a more philosophical
interpretation of the Rubā‘iyyāt.


In his Rubā‘iyyāt, Khayyam challenged
religious doctrines, alluded to the hypocrisy of the clergy, cast
doubt on almost every facet of religious belief, and appears to have
advocated a type of humanism. It is no wonder that some referred to
him as the “Eastern Voltaire” (Dole 1901, 81). This
Western image, solidified by the Victorian sense of the exotic,
romantic, and often erotic notions attached to the East, was echoed
through the rendition of the Rubā‘iyyāt by
Edward FitzGerald in the 19th century.

triangles with the phrase ‘right triangle’? Is there
something common to them all signified by this phrase? If so, what is
it, and how is it related to the particular right triangles? The

The History of Utilitarianism,0.4949395954608917,0.6345346570014954,"


Utilitarianism is one of the most powerful and persuasive approaches
to normative ethics in the history of philosophy. Though not
fully articulated until the 19th century, proto-utilitarian
positions can be discerned throughout the history of ethical
theory.


Though there are many varieties of the view discussed,
utilitarianism is generally held to be the view that the morally right
action is the action that produces the most good. There are many
ways to spell out this general claim. One thing to note is that
the theory is a form of consequentialism: the right action is
understood entirely in terms of consequences produced. What
distinguishes utilitarianism from egoism has to do with the scope of
the relevant consequences. On the utilitarian view one ought to
maximize the overall good — that is, consider the good of others
as well as one's own good.


The Classical Utilitarians, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill,
identified the good with pleasure, so, like Epicurus, were hedonists
about value. They also held that we ought to maximize the good,
that is, bring about ‘the greatest amount of good for the
greatest number’.


Utilitarianism is also distinguished by impartiality and
agent-neutrality. Everyone's happiness counts the
same. When one maximizes the good, it is the good
impartially considered. My good counts for no more than
anyone else's good. Further, the reason I have to promote
the overall good is the same reason anyone else has to so promote the
good. It is not peculiar to me.


All of these features of this approach to moral evaluation and/or
moral decision-making have proven to be somewhat controversial and
subsequent controversies have led to changes in the Classical version
of the theory.

of ethics. Philosophers use a number of terms to refer to such value.
The intrinsic value of something is said to be the value that that
thing has “in itself,” or “for its own sake,”
or “as such,” or “in its own right.” Extrinsic
value is value that is not intrinsic.


Many philosophers take intrinsic value to be crucial to a variety of
moral judgments. For example, according to a fundamental form of
consequentialism, whether an action is morally right or wrong
has exclusively to do with whether its consequences are intrinsically
better than those of any other action one can perform under the
circumstances. Many other theories also hold that what it is right or
wrong to do has at least in part to do with the intrinsic value of the
consequences of the actions one can perform. Moreover, if, as is
commonly believed, what one is morally responsible for doing
is some function of the rightness or wrongness of what one does, then
intrinsic value would seem relevant to judgments about responsibility,
too. Intrinsic value is also often taken to be pertinent to judgments
about moral justice (whether having to do with moral rights
or moral desert), insofar as it is good that justice is done and bad
that justice is denied, in ways that appear intimately tied to
intrinsic value. Finally, it is typically thought that judgments about
moral virtue and vice also turn on questions of intrinsic
value, inasmuch as virtues are good, and vices bad, again in ways that
appear closely connected to such value.


All four types of moral judgments have been the subject of
discussion since the dawn of western philosophy in ancient Greece. The
Greeks themselves were especially concerned with questions about virtue
and vice, and the concept of intrinsic value may be found at work in
their writings and in the writings of moral philosophers ever since.
Despite this fact, and rather surprisingly, it is only within the last
one hundred years or so that this concept has itself been the subject
of sustained scrutiny, and even within this relatively brief period the
scrutiny has waxed and waned.

Value Pluralism,0.6248669028282166,0.8554242253303528,"


The word ‘pluralism’ generally refers to the view that
there are many of the things in question (concepts, scientific world
views, discourses, viewpoints etc.) The issues arising from there
being many differ widely from subject area to subject area. This entry
is concerned with moral pluralism—the view that there are many
different moral values.


Moral value pluralism should be distinguished from political
pluralism. Political pluralism, which, like moral value pluralism, is
often referred to as ‘value pluralism’, is a view
associated with political liberalism. Political pluralism is concerned
with the question of what sort of restrictions governments can put on
people’s freedom to act according to their values. One version
of political pluralism is based on moral value pluralism, claiming
that there are irreducibly plural moral values and that this justifies
a liberal political system. (See Isaiah Berlin, 1969; George Crowder,
2002; William Galston, 2002, and for a more detailed discussion of
this see the entry on
 Isaiah Berlin).  Political Liberalism need
not be based on value pluralism: a defence of toleration of different
value systems need not rely on the claim that there are plural moral
values. We shall leave political pluralism aside for the purposes of
this entry, and concentrate on moral value pluralism.
 It is also worth emphasising that moral value pluralism does not
entail relativism. The idea is not that all values or value systems
are equally true. Value pluralism is independent of any particular
meta-ethical view. It is a claim about the normative domain: about
what value looks like. 

Commonsensically we talk about lots of
different values—happiness, liberty, friendship, and so
on. The question about pluralism in moral theory is whether these
apparently different values are all reducible to one supervalue, or
whether we should think that there really are several distinct
values.

There are different ways that value might be conceived, but
the debate about pluralism should be able to cut across different
sorts of moral theory. Traditionally, moral philosophers recognize
three different ways of thinking about morality: the deontological
way, the consequentialist way, and the virtue ethics way, although there
is debate about the cogency of these
 distinctions.[1]
The term ‘value’ as it appears in ‘value
pluralism’ is neutral between these three
theories. Deontologists think of morality as being fundamentally about
moral principles. Thus the question of whether a deontological theory
is pluralist is a question about how many fundamental principles there
are. The consequentialist, by contrast, tends to see value as being
realized by goods in the world, such as friendship, knowledge, beauty
and so on, and the question of pluralism is thus a question about how
many fundamental goods there are. Virtue ethicists focus on how agents
should be, so are interested both in principles of action (or
motivation) and the pursuit of goods, such as friendship.



Deontologists can clearly be monists or pluralists. Kant can be
understood as a monist—arguing that there is one overarching
principle, and that all other principles are derived from it. Ross, by
contrast, is a  pluralist, because he thinks that
there is a plurality of prima facie duties. (See Kant (1948), Ross
(1930).)[2]

 

Many utilitarians are monists, arguing that there is only one
fundamental value and that is well-being or pleasure or happiness, or
something of that sort. In other words, some utilitarians are
committed to hedonism.  Monist utilitarians must claim that all other
putative values, such as friendship, knowledge and so on, are only
instrumental values, which are valuable in so far as they contribute
to the foundational value. But utilitarians need not be
monists. Amartya Sen, for example, argues that utilitarians can take a
‘vector view of utility’, according to which there are
differences in the qualities as well of the quantites of utility in
goods in the world. According to Sen, we should interpet Mill as a
pluralist in this way. (I return to Mill below: it is not entirely
clear how we should understand his view). Sen points out that desire
satisfaction theorists can be pluralists too. Just as different sorts
of pleasure might have different sorts of value, so different desires
might have different sorts of value. (Sen, 1981). Even utilitarians
who claim that the value to be maximized is well-being can be
pluralist: a prominent view of well-being is that well-being itself is
plural, an objective list of things that are fundamentally
plural. (See Finnis 1980; Griffin 1986; for recent defences see
Fletcher, 2013, Lin, 2014). Another reason to think that hedonistic
utilitarians should be pluralists is that it seems essential to say
something about the disvalue of pain. As Shelly Kagan points out
(2014), we need an account of ill-being in addition to an account of
well-being. 

In what follows I will be as neutral as possible between different
theoretical approaches to morality, and will focus on the debate
between monists and pluralists. Monists claim that there is only one
ultimate value.  Pluralists argue that there really are several
different values, and that these values are not reducible to each
other or to a supervalue. Monism has the advantage of relative
simplicity: once it has been determined what the supervalue is
(whether we think of the super value in terms of the goods approach or
any other approach) much of the hard work has been done. On the other
hand, monism may be too simple: it may not capture the real texture of
our ethical lives. However, pluralism faces the difficulty of
explaining how different fundamental values relate to each other, and
how they can be compared.

Value Theory,0.6229141354560852,0.8386939167976379,"

The term “value theory” is used in at least three
different ways in philosophy. In its broadest sense, “value
theory” is a catch-all label used to encompass all branches of
moral philosophy, social and political philosophy, aesthetics, and
sometimes feminist philosophy and the philosophy of religion —
whatever areas of philosophy are deemed to encompass some
“evaluative” aspect. In its narrowest sense, “value
theory” is used for a relatively narrow area of normative
ethical theory particularly, but not exclusively, of concern to
consequentialists. In this narrow sense, “value theory” is
roughly synonymous with “axiology”. Axiology can be
thought of as primarily concerned with classifying what things are
good, and how good they are. For instance, a traditional question of
axiology concerns whether the objects of value are subjective
psychological states, or objective states of the world. 

But in a more useful sense, “value theory” designates the
area of moral philosophy that is concerned with theoretical questions
about value and goodness of all varieties — the theory of value.
The theory of value, so construed, encompasses axiology, but also
includes many other questions about the nature of value and its
relation to other moral categories. The division of moral theory into
the theory of value, as contrasting with other areas of investigation,
cross-cuts the traditional classification of moral theory into
normative and metaethical inquiry, but is a worthy distinction in its
own right; theoretical questions about value constitute a core domain
of interest in moral theory, often cross the boundaries between the
normative and the metaethical, and have a distinguished history of
investigation. This article surveys a range of the questions which
come up in the theory of value, and attempts to impose some structure
on the terrain by including some observations about how they are
related to one another.

His works
display his mastery of Buddhist as well as non-Buddhist thought of the

traditions that are traditionally considered distinct:
Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, and
 Yogācāra.[2]
His master work

the Abhidharma (Abhidharmakośabhāṣya), is

His three concise works on
Yogācāra philosophy set a new standard for that school, which
became mainstream Buddhist metaphysics in India for half a

Vienna Circle,0.858320951461792,0.5825982689857483,"

The Vienna Circle was a group of early twentieth-century philosophers
who sought to reconceptualize empiricism by means of their
interpretation of then recent advances in the physical and formal
sciences. Their radically anti-metaphysical stance was supported by an
empiricist criterion of meaning and a broadly logicist conception of
mathematics. They denied that any principle or claim was synthetic
a priori. Moreover, they sought to account for the
presuppositions of scientific theories by regimenting such theories
within a logical framework so that the important role played by
conventions, either in the form of definitions or of other analytical
framework principles, became evident. The Vienna Circle’s
theories were constantly changing. In spite (or perhaps because) of
this, they helped to provide the blueprint for analytical philosophy
of science as meta-theory—a “second-order”
reflection of “first-order” sciences. While the Vienna
Circle’s early form of logical empiricism (or logical positivism
or neopositivism: these labels will be used interchangeably here) no
longer represents an active research program, recent history of
philosophy of science has unearthed much previously neglected variety
and depth in the doctrines of the Circle’s protagonists, some of
whose positions retain relevance for contemporary analytical
philosophy.

from a variety of sources and combined these elements into a

The Ethics and Rationality of Voting,0.668138325214386,0.9229252934455872,"

This entry focuses on six major questions concerning the rationality
and morality of voting:

Is it rational for an individual citizen to vote?
Is there a moral duty to vote?
Are there moral obligations regarding how citizens vote?
Is it justifiable for governments to compel citizens to vote?
Is it permissible to buy, trade, and sell votes?
Who ought to have the right to vote, and should every citizen have
an equal vote?


Question 6 concerns the broader question of whether democratic forms
of government are preferable to the alternatives; see Christiano

Think back to the last time you needed to make a decision as a member
of a group.  This may have been when you voted for your favorite
political candidate during the last election.  On a smaller scale, it
may have been when you took part in a committee that needed to choose
the best candidate for a job or a student to receive a special award.
What method, or procedure, did the group use to make the final
decision?  Many interesting issues arise when we carefully examine our
group decision-making processes. Consider a simple example of a group
of friends deciding where to go for dinner. If everyone agrees on
which restaurant is best, then it is obvious where to go. But how
should the friends decide where to go if they have different opinions
about which restaurant is best? Is there always a choice that is
“fair” taking into account everyone's opinions? Or are
there situations in which one person must be chosen to act as a
“dictator” by making a unilateral decision?


This article introduces and critically examines a number of different
voting methods. The goal is not to provide a general overview of
social choice theory or even a comprehensive account of voting theory.
Rather, my objective is to highlight and discuss key results and
issues that underlie phenomena that we observe when decision makers
come together to make a collective decision.  So, some topics will

[Editor's Note: The following new entry by Seth Lazar replaces the
 former entry
 on this topic by the previous author.]


Some reject the very idea of the “morality of
 war”.[1]
 Of those, some deny that morality applies at all once the guns strike
up; for others, no plausible moral theory could license the
exceptional horrors of war. The first group are sometimes called
realists. The second group are pacifists. The task of just war theory
is to seek a middle path between them: to justify at least some wars,
but also to limit them (Ramsey 1961). Although realism undoubtedly has
its adherents, few philosophers find it
 compelling.[2]
 The real challenge to just war theory comes from pacifism. And we
should remember, from the outset, that this challenge is real. The
justified war might well be a chimera.

However, this entry explores the middle path between realism and
pacifism. It begins by outlining the central substantive divide in
contemporary just war theory, before introducing the methodological
schisms underpinning that debate. It then discusses the moral evaluation
of wars as a whole, and of individual acts within war (traditionally,
though somewhat misleadingly, called jus ad bellum and
jus in bello respectively).

James Ward,0.6443031430244446,0.4004360139369965,"


British idealism was the dominant philosophical movement in the
closing decades of the nineteenth century. Its best-known
representatives—philosophers of the like of Thomas Hill Green and
Francis Herbert Bradley—held a version of Absolute idealism, the
theory that reality is a single unified consciousness or cosmic
experience. The doctrine has its roots in the philosophies of Spinoza,
Kant and Hegel, but the British idealists elaborated it in independent,
original ways. In this, they were motivated by a desire to oppose
materialism and vindicate our instinctive belief that human life has a
meaning. As Bradley forcefully put it in his Logic,
“that the glory of this world in the end is appearance leaves the
world more glorious, if we feel it is a show of some fuller splendor;
but the sensuous curtain is a deception and a cheat, if it hides some
colourless movement of atoms […]” (Bradley 1883: 590).


It is easy to see, however, how Absolute idealism threatens those very
ideals it is supposed to defend, since it denies that finite existence
is truly real and downgrades it to ‘a show of some fuller
splendor.’ If reality is a single unified totality, what is the
individual self? If the past, the present and the future are not real
for the Absolute, wherein lays our freedom? If reality is eternally
perfect, what is the point of our moral struggles? The philosophy of
the Cambridge Professor James Ward (1843–1925)—now a
largely forgotten figure but once a very respected thinker—is an
attempt at overcoming these difficulties by combining the idealistic
standpoint with a pluralistic metaphysics.

Max Weber,0.658988356590271,0.7416752576828003,"

Arguably the foremost social theorist of the twentieth century, Max
Weber is known as a principal architect of modern social science along
with Karl Marx and Emil Durkheim. Weber’s wide-ranging
contributions gave critical impetus to the birth of new academic
disciplines such as sociology as well as to the significant
reorientation in law, economics, political science, and religious
studies. His methodological writings were instrumental in establishing
the self-identity of modern social science as a distinct field of
inquiry; he is still claimed as the source of inspiration by empirical
positivists and their hermeneutic detractors alike. More
substantively, Weber’s two most celebrated contributions were
the “rationalization thesis,” a grand meta-historical
analysis of the dominance of the west in modern times, and the
“Protestant Ethic thesis,” a non-Marxist genealogy of
modern capitalism. Together, these two theses helped launch his
reputation as one of the founding theorists of modernity. In addition,
his avid interest and participation in politics led to a unique strand
of political realism comparable to that of Machiavelli and Hobbes. As
such, Max Weber’s influence was far-reaching across the vast
array of disciplinary, methodological, ideological and philosophical
reflections that are still our own and increasingly more so.

Simone Weil,0.5309221148490906,0.9899538159370422,"

Simone Weil (1909–1943) philosophized on thresholds and across
borders. Her persistent desire for truth and justice led her to both
elite academies and factory floors, political praxis and spiritual
solitude. At different times she was an activist, a pacifist, a
militant, a mystic, and an exile; but throughout, in her inquiry into
reality and orientation to the good, she remained a philosopher. Her
oeuvre features deliberate contradiction yet demonstrates remarkable
clarity. It is value centered and integrated but not systematic. It
contains scattered notes of her translations of and commentaries on
several ancient Greek texts, Pythagorean geometry formulae, and
detailed accounts of her daily tasks within a factory; but her oeuvre
is also composed of addresses to political, industrial, and religious
leaders as well as pieces intended for university students, radical
militants, industrial workers, and farm laborers. In both her life and
her thought—itself an unstable distinction with respect to
Weil—she is a philosopher of margins and paradoxes. In part
because Weil’s thought defies categorization, the ways in which
her ideas are taken up often say as much about her commentator as they
do about her. She was taken as a prototype for Albert Camus’s
révoltés and praised by André Gide as
“the patron saint of all outsiders”. Giorgio Agamben
described her conscience as “the most lucid of our times”,
and Hannah Arendt claimed that perhaps only Weil treated the subject
of labor “without prejudice and sentimentality”. Maurice
Blanchot described Weil as an “exceptional figure” who
offers “an example of certitude” in the modern world, and
Iris Murdoch wrote of “a profoundly disciplined life behind her
writings” that gave “an authority which cannot be
imitated”. But Weil was also criticized by Leon Trotsky as a
“melancholy revolutionary” and disparaged as
“crazy” by Charles de Gaulle. These remarks, however,
betray an irony of which Weil was well aware and about which she was
deeply concerned near the end of her life, namely, that her person
would be considered more than her thought. By categorically focusing
on the philosophical concepts Weil articulated and developed, this
entry attempts to present her philosophy while speaking to her
concern.

Following Weil’s philosophical development, her central concepts
are addressed under five categories: social-political philosophy,
epistemology, ethics, metaphysical and religious philosophy, and
aesthetics. The periodization employed is as follows: 1925–1934
(early), 1935–1939 (middle), 1939–1943 (late). It is
important to note that, given Weil’s rejection of systematicity
and development of concepts, these categories and periods introduce a
degree of artifice into her thought. The conclusion of this entry
reports on her reception among the Continental and Anglo-American
traditions of philosophy.

Well-being is most commonly used in philosophy to describe what is
non-instrumentally or ultimately good for a person. The
question of what well-being consists in is of independent interest,
but it is of great importance in moral philosophy, especially in the
case of utilitarianism, according to which the only moral requirement is that well-being be maximized. Significant challenges to the very notion have been mounted,
in particular by G.E. Moore and T.M. Scanlon. It has become standard
to distinguish theories of well-being as either hedonist theories,
desire theories, or objective list theories. According to the view
known as welfarism, well-being is the only value. Also important in
ethics is the question of how a person’s moral character and actions relate to their well-being.

shape mean almost more to me than knowledge itself”. He was 
unusual among scientists and mathematicians of his time in being 
attracted to idealist philosophy: his idealist leanings can be seen 
particularly in his work on the foundations of mathematics. In his 
youth, Kant’s doctrines made a great impression on him; later he was 
stirred both by Fichte’s metaphysical idealism and by Husserlian 
phenomenology. Although Weyl came to question the certainties claimed
by idealism, he cleaved always to the primacy of intuition he had 
first learned from Kant, and to its expression by Fichte as the 
“inner light” of individual consciousness.

William Whewell (1794–1866) was one of the most important and
influential figures in nineteenth-century Britain. Whewell, a
polymath, wrote extensively on numerous subjects, including mechanics,
mineralogy, geology, astronomy, political economy, theology,
educational reform, international law, and architecture, as well as
the works that remain the most well-known today in philosophy of
science, history of science, and moral philosophy. He was one of the
founding members and a president of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, a fellow of the Royal Society, president of
the Geological Society, and longtime Master of Trinity College,
Cambridge. In his own time his influence was acknowledged by the major
scientists of the day, such as John Herschel, Charles Darwin, Charles
Lyell and Michael Faraday, who frequently turned to Whewell for
philosophical and scientific advice, and, interestingly, for
terminological assistance. Whewell invented the terms
“anode,” “cathode,” and “ion” for
Faraday. In response to a challenge by the poet S.T. Coleridge in
1833, Whewell invented the English word “scientist;”
before this time the only terms in use were “natural
philosopher” and “man of science”. Whewell was
greatly influenced by his association with three of his fellow
students at Cambridge: Charles Babbage, John Herschel, and Richard
Jones. Over the winter of 1812 and spring of 1813, the four met for
what they called “Philosophical Breakfasts” at which they
discussed induction and scientific method, among other topics (see
Snyder 2011).

Whewell is most known today for his extensive works on the history and
philosophy of science. His philosophy of science was attacked by John
Stuart Mill in his System of Logic, causing an interesting
and fruitful debate between them over the nature of inductive
reasoning in science, moral philosophy, and political economy (for a
detailed discussion of this debate, see Snyder 2006). It is in the
context of the debate over philosophy of science that Whewell’s
philosophy was rediscovered in the 20th century by critics of logical
positivism. In this entry, I will focus on the most important
philosophical aspects of Whewell’s works: his philosophy of
science, including his views of induction, confirmation, and necessary
truth; his view of the relation between scientific practice, history
of science, and philosophy of science; and his moral philosophy. His
view of induction is the most interesting and important part of his
philosophy as well as the most often misinterpreted.

Whitehead’s intellectual life is often divided into three main
periods. The first corresponds roughly to his time at Cambridge from
1884 to 1910. It was during these years that he worked primarily on
issues in mathematics and logic. It was also during this time that he
collaborated with Russell. The second main period, from 1910 to 1924,

Whitehead concentrated mainly on issues in physics, the philosophy of
science, and the philosophy of education. The third main period

philosophy and metaphysics by Greek, Islamic and Jewish thinkers that
had recently become available in Latin translation. William took these
writings to pose errors dangerous to the Christian faith, and his
philosophical works are in large part aimed at combating their errors.
Yet at the same time he recognized their philosophical value and,
though often confused about their meaning, incorporated their teachings
into his own thought.  On many of the important issues of later
medieval thought, William is the first to provide in-depth discussions,

source for our understanding of the development of medieval
philosophy.

Born in Champeaux, William (ca. 1070-1122) taught at the cathedral
school of Notre Dame in Paris and the monastery of St. Victor. His
staunch defense of realism in logic and metaphysics earned him a
reputation as a preeminent philosopher of the late eleventh and early
twelfth centuries. William was a student of Anselm of Laon, and, like
others from his school, he was committed to the view that articles of
faith are beyond the capacity of human reason to understand and human
language to explain. He was recognized in his day as one of the
continent's most influential theologians. These philosophical and
theological commitments fueled the conflict with his most famous
student, Peter Abelard, a conflict that was continued between Abelard
and William's most famous protégé, Bernard of
Clairvaux.

Bernard Williams,0.5267377495765686,0.6783040761947632,"

Bernard Williams (1929–2003) was a leading influence in
philosophical ethics in the latter half of the twentieth century. He
rejected the codification of ethics into moral theories that views
such as Kantianism and (above all) utilitarianism see as essential to
philosophical thinking about ethics, arguing that our ethical life is
too untidy to be captured by any systematic moral theory. He was also
an important contributor to debates on moral psychology, personal
identity, equality, morality and the emotions, and the interpretation
of philosophers including Wittgenstein, Nietzsche, Descartes,
Aristotle, and Plato.

Williams’ contributions were grounded in two overriding
commitments. First, he was deeply impressed by the importance of
subjective integrity or authenticity, and much of his work is
essentially a sustained attempt to make sense of how moral theorizing
can avoid alienating individuals from their deepest values, cares and
life-projects. Second, this sustained attempt was made under the
umbrella of a variety of philosophical naturalism which was both
anti-Platonic and anti-reductionist. He expressed these twin
commitments late in his life when he dreamed, wistfully, of “a
philosophy that would be thoroughly truthful and honestly
helpful” (2005: 212). 

In what follows, we trace Williams’ personal and philosophical
development, beginning with a biographical summary and proceeding to a
discussion of his most important ideas.

Donald Cary Williams,0.7535067796707153,0.5635343790054321,"
 The published work of Donald Williams (1899–1983) ranges
across a broad spectrum in philosophy, but his importance as a
philosopher rests in large measure on four major
achievements. Firstly, in a period when the role of philosophy was
being diminished and trivialized, he persisted with a traditional
style of philosophizing.  Although it remained unfashionable
throughout most of his active years, he held to the classic program of
Western philosophy: to explain and defend our capacity to attain
knowledge (so far as that reaches), in the light of that to present a
well-reasoned account of the most general and fundamental features of
Reality, and on that basis to propose a wise scheme for the good
life. His unswerving allegiance to this project, keeping it alive in
dark days, has had its reward. At least in Anglophone circles, these
classic metaphysical, epistemic and ethical issues are once more
firmly on the agenda.


Williams’ own contributions belong to the epistemic and
metaphysical aspects of the project rather than its ethical side
(except for a brief defense of ethics as ultimately “pure
postulate” (1933b)). So, secondly, as an account of our
world he proposed an empirically informed materialistic
naturalism. Among its distinctive features, he champions a
4-dimensional space-time which accords equal status to Past, Present,
and Future.


Thirdly, this cosmology is embedded in an original and powerful
theory of the nature of properties, the thesis that properties are
themselves particulars rather than universals. This Trope theory, as it
has come to be known, following Williams’ own usage, has become
one of the standard alternatives in the Problem of Universals.


And in the fourth place, in the teeth of the prevailing skepticism
on this topic, he developed an original and boldly positive
justification of inductive inference.

John Cook Wilson (1849–1915) was Wykeham Professor of Logic at New
College, Oxford and the founder of ‘Oxford Realism’, a
philosophical movement that flourished at Oxford during the first
decades of the 20th century. Although trained as a
classicist and a mathematician, his most important contribution was to
the theory of knowledge, where he argued that knowledge is factive and
not definable in terms of belief, and he criticized ‘hybrid’ and
‘externalist’ accounts. He also argued for direct realism
in perception, criticizing both empiricism and idealism, and argued for
a moderate nominalist view of universals as being in rebus and
only ‘apprehended’ by their particulars. His influence
helped swaying Oxford away from idealism and, through figures such as
H. A. Prichard, Gilbert Ryle, or J. L. Austin, his ideas were also to
some extent at the origin of ‘moral intuitionism’ and
‘ordinary language philosophy’ which defined much of Oxford
philosophy until the second half of the twentieth-century.
Nevertheless, his name and legacy were all but forgotten for
generations after World War II. Still, his views on knowledge are with
us today, being in part at work in the writings of philosophers as
diverse as John McDowell, Charles Travis, and Timothy Williamson.

Ludwig Wittgenstein,0.8642412424087524,0.6526036262512207,"


Considered by some to be the greatest philosopher of the 20th century,
Ludwig Wittgenstein played a central, if controversial, role in
20th-century analytic philosophy. He continues to influence current
philosophical thought in topics as diverse as logic and language,
perception and intention, ethics and religion, aesthetics and culture.
Originally, there were two commonly recognized stages of
Wittgenstein’s thought—the early and the later—both
of which were taken to be pivotal in their respective periods. In more
recent scholarship, this division has been questioned: some
interpreters have claimed a unity between all stages of his thought,
while others talk of a more nuanced division, adding stages such as
the middle Wittgenstein and the third Wittgenstein. Still, it is
commonly acknowledged that the early Wittgenstein is epitomized in his
Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. By showing the application of
modern logic to metaphysics, via language, he provided new insights
into the relations between world, thought and language and thereby into
the nature of philosophy. It is the later Wittgenstein, mostly
recognized in the Philosophical Investigations, who took the
more revolutionary step in critiquing all of traditional philosophy
including its climax in his own early work. The nature of his new
philosophy is heralded as anti-systematic through and through, yet
still conducive to genuine philosophical understanding of traditional
problems.

Christian Wolff,0.6046003103256226,0.39912933111190796,"


Christian Wolff (1679–1754), also known as Christian von Wolfius, was
a Rationalist philosopher of the German Enlightenment. His corpus
includes over 26 titles, spanning more than 42 quarto
volumes, with contributions primarily in the areas of mathematics and
philosophy. He is often regarded as the central historical figure who
links the philosophical systems of Leibniz and Kant. Although Wolff's
influence was largely isolated to German schools and universities
during and shortly after his lifetime, he did receive some
international acclaim. He was a nonresident member of all four major
European scientific academies: the Royal Society of London in 1709;
the Berlin Academy in 1711; the St Petersburg Academy in 1725; and the
Paris Academy in 1733. To his credit, he is the first philosopher
recognized to furnish Germans with a complete system of philosophy in
their own language (Beck 1969, 274).


According to Kant, in the “Preface” to the Critique
of Pure Reason (2nd ed), Wolff is “the greatest of all
dogmatic philosophers.” Wolff's “strict method”
in science, Kant explains, is predicated on “the regular
ascertainment of principles, the clear determination of concepts, the
attempt at strictness in proofs, and the prevention of audacious leaps
in inferences” (Kant, 1998, 120). Like many other philosophers of
the Modern period, such as Descartes, Hobbes, and Spinoza, Wolff
believed the method of mathematics, if properly applied, could be used
to expand other areas of human knowledge. Perhaps more so than any of
his contemporaries, Wolff took this style of exposition to an extreme.
A familiar criticism of Wolff, even in his own lifetime, is that his
works are long-winded and often involve overly complicated
demonstrations. Arguably, Wolff's most direct impact on the
history of western philosophy resides not in any one of his own
particular works, but rather on the influence he had on the German
undergraduate university curriculum. The more notable beneficiaries of
the Wolffian systematization of philosophy include the
early Kant, Alexander Baumgarten (1714–1762), Samuel Formey
(1711–1797), Johann Christoph Gottsched (1700–1766), Martin Knutzen
(1713–1751), Georg Friedrich Meier (1718–1777), and Moses Mendelssohn
(1729–1786).

Her first publication was on the education of daughters; she went on
to write about politics, history and various aspects of philosophy in
a number of different genres that included critical reviews,
translations, pamphlets, and novels. Best known for her
Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), her influence went

Scandinavia, she had an impact on the Romantic movement.

World Government,0.4259538948535919,0.6793128848075867,"


‘World government’ refers to the idea of all humankind
united under one common political authority. Arguably, it has not
existed so far in human history, yet proposals for a unified global
political authority have existed since ancient times—in the
ambition of kings, popes and emperors, and the dreams of poets and
philosophers.


Proponents of world government offer distinct reasons for
why it is an ideal of political organization. Some are
motivated negatively and see world government as the
definitive solution to old and new human problems such as war and the
development of weapons of mass destruction, global poverty and
inequality, and environmental degradation. More positively, some have
advocated world government as a proper reflection of the unity of the
cosmos, under reason or God. Proponents have also differed historically
in their views of the form that a world government should
take. While medieval thinkers advocated world government under a single
monarch or emperor who would possess supreme authority over all other
lesser rulers, modern proponents generally do not advocate a wholesale
dismantling of the sovereign states system but incremental innovations
in global institutional design to move humanity toward world federalism
or cosmopolitan democracy.


Critics of world government have offered three main kinds of
objections—to do with the feasibility, desirability and
necessity of establishing a common global political authority.


First, a realist argument, advanced by contemporary
international ‘realist’ theorists, holds that world
government is infeasible; ideas of world government constitute
exercises in utopian thinking, and are utterly impractical as a goal
for human political organization. Assuming that world government would
lead to desirable outcomes such as perpetual peace, realists are
skeptical that world government will ever materialize as an
institutional reality, given the problems of egoistic or corrupted
human nature, or the logic of international anarchy that characterizes
a world of states, all jealously guarding their own sovereignty or
claims to supreme authority. World government is thus infeasible as a
solution to global problems because of the unsurpassable difficulties
of establishing “authoritative hierarchies” at the global
or international level (Krasner 1999, 42). A related
consequentialist argument speculates that even if world
government were desirable, the process of creating a world government
may produce more harm than good; the necessary evils committed on the
road to establishing a world government would outweigh whatever
benefits might result from its achievement (Rousseau 1756/1917).


Second, even if world government were shown to be a feasible
political project, it may be an undesirable one. One set of reasons for
its undesirability emphasizes the potential power and oppressiveness of
a global political authority. In one version of this 
objection—the tyranny argument—world government would descend
into a global tyranny, hindering rather than enhancing the ideal of
human autonomy (Kant 1991). Instead of delivering impartial global
justice and peace, a world government may form an inescapable tyranny
that would have the power to make humanity serve its own interests, and
opposition against which might engender incessant and intractable civil
wars (Waltz 1979). In another version of this objection—the
homogeneity argument—world government may be so strong
and pervasive as to create a homogenizing effect, obliterating distinct
cultures and communities that are intrinsically valuable. The
institution of a world government would thus destroy the rich social
pluralism that animates human life (Walzer 2004). While the preceding
two arguments stem from fear of the potential power of a world
government, another set of concerns that make world government
undesirable focuses on its potential weakness as a form of political
organization. The objections on this account are that the inevitable
remoteness of a global political authority would dilute the laws,
making them ineffectual and meaningless. The posited weakness of world
government thus leads to objections based on its potential
inefficiency and soullessness (Kant 1991).


Third, contemporary liberal theorists argue mainly that world
government, in the form of a global leviathan with supreme legislative,
executive, adjudicative and enforcement powers, is largely unnecessary
to solve problems such as war, global poverty, and environmental
catastrophe. World government so conceived is neither necessary nor
sufficient to achieve the aims of a liberal agenda. Even cosmopolitan
liberals do not argue that moral cosmopolitanism necessarily entails
political cosmopolitanism in the form of a world government. The
liberal rejection of world government, however, does not amount to an
endorsement of the conventional system of sovereign states or the
contemporary international order, “with its extreme injustices,
crippling poverty, and inequalities” (Rawls 1999, 117). Instead,
most liberal theorists envision the need for authoritative
international and global institutions that modify significantly the
powers and prerogatives traditionally attributed to the sovereign
state.


This entry will, first, discuss the positive and negative
motivations underlying proposals for world government. In a selective
discussion of the idea's history, the entry will focus on
Dante's medieval treatise on the necessity of a world monarch or
emperor, and then consider mainly arguments by Hobbes, Rousseau and
Kant that reveal more skepticism about world government as a solution
to the problem of war and peace among sovereign states. Most of the
objections against the idea of world government outlined above are
articulated in their writings. The historical background section will
continue with the revival of ideas of world government in the twentieth
century, prompted by technological progress, economic globalization,
and the experience of two devastating world wars. Debates about world
government during the Cold War, however, were pervaded by the
ideological division of the world, and the section concludes with an
exploration of socialist views on world government.


Second, the entry will explore debates in contemporary theory. One
set of debates is located within international relations theory,
between realist and neorealist, ‘international society’,
liberal internationalist, republican, and constructivist schools. A
second set of discussions about world government is located within
contemporary liberal theory, involving the foremost liberal political
philosopher of the twentieth century, John Rawls, and his cosmopolitan
liberal critics. A third set of debates has emerged among contemporary
republican, democratic and critical theorists. There is lively debate
within and between these sets of discussions about the feasibility,
desirability and necessity of the political project of establishing a
world sovereign state with some measure of coercive, centralized global
authority. While the idea of world government has experienced an
intellectual resurgence in the past five years, it coexists with the
concept of “global governance,” which highlights the
increasing agency of global civil society and nonstate actors, and
deliberately eschews the coercive and centralized components of
domestic models of government for looser, decentralized modes of
achieving similar functions of government. The conclusion to the entry
questions whether global governance without world government in
contemporary world conditions can really deliver the goods of global
security, universal human rights, social justice, and environmental
protection that have made the ideal of world government a persistent if
elusive human aspiration.

Chauncey Wright,0.9433064460754396,0.5744399428367615,"


Chauncey Wright was an American philosopher of science of the second
half of the nineteenth century and an early proponent of Darwinism in
the United States. Sometimes cited as a founder of pragmatism, he is
more appropriately remembered as an original 
thinker in the tradition of David Hume and John Stuart 
Mill.[1]
Wright's primary interest and originality lay in philosophy of
science, but his insights and influence carried over to other venues,
including philosophy of education and theory of meaning. Wright
exercised a great influence at a crucial time in American cultural
life — in the 1860s and 70s, when the force of religious piety
and Transcendentalism was waning.  He was a tireless critic of
metaphysics and the natural theology he believed it served, but he was
also a discriminating interpreter of principles in science and
philosophy. He wrote little and his influence was exerted by means of
conversation and philosophical discussion with the circle of
intellectuals and academics centered in Cambridge, Mass. from
1850–75. This circle included Charles S. Peirce, William James,
and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., all of whom acknowledged Wright's
influence.[2]


Wright accepted Hume's rejection of rational a priori knowledge and,
following the positivist Auguste Comte (1789–1857), he applied
Hume's lesson to theory in science. Wright regarded theory as a
grammar or logical template for organizing sense experience, which was
the only true origin of knowledge. As such, theory was a labor-saving
device and usually mathematical in character. Some theoretical
entities were real, but it is extremely difficult to settle upon any
as surely real, given the method of science. That method is
verification. Wright used the term verification to mean the testing of
theories by deducing from them consequences that can be confirmed by
direct perception, the “undoubted testimony of the senses”
(PD 47). What are verified are predicted consequences of
theory. This commitment to the sensory base of ideas both at the
beginning and end of scientific investigation reinforced Wright's
belief that utility is what makes both nature and human affairs
intelligible. The principle of utility informed his understanding of
Darwin's Origin of Species as offering not axioms for deduction
but descriptive principles, in particular natural selection, that
encompassed a wide range of disparate causes of change in
organisms. From this vantage point on science, Wright became a
penetrating interpreter and a brilliant defender of Darwinism in its
introduction into the United States. In what follows, Wright's
philosophy of science will be presented, highlighting the character of
his empiricism as it is revealed through his understanding of
induction. The influence of Mill's utilitarianism will be evident in
his interpretation of Darwin, which is presented next. The nature of
his positivism and his views on cosmology and natural theology are
followed by a general characterization of his scientific
philosophy.

Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt,0.6712494492530823,0.4450129866600037,"

Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt (1832–1920) is known to posterity as
the “father of experimental psychology” and the founder of
the first psychology laboratory (Boring 1950: 317, 322,
 344–5),[1]
 whence he exerted enormous influence on the development of psychology
as a discipline, especially in the United States. Reserved and shy in
public (cf. Kusch 1995: 249, f.), Wundt aggressively dominated his
chosen arenas, the lecture hall and the pages of books, with a witty
and sardonic persona (cf., e.g., Wundt 1911a: 61; Boring 1950: 317).
His scope was vast, his output incredible. His writings, totaling an
estimated 53,000 pages, include: articles on animal and human
physiology, poisons, vision, spiritualism, hypnotism, history, and
politics; text- and handbooks of “medical physics” and
human physiology; encyclopedic tomes on linguistics, logic, ethics,
religion, a “system of philosophy;” not to mention his
magna opera, the Grundzüge der physiologischen
Psychologie and the Völkerpsychologie (in ten
 volumes).[2]
 Although his work spans several disciplines—physiology,
psychology, and philosophy—Wundt would not have considered
himself an “interdisciplinary” or
“pluralistic” thinker: he was to the core a
foundationalist, whose great ambition was establishing a
philosophico-scientific system of knowledge, practice, and politics
(see
 Section 7,
 below) (Boring 1950: 327). Despite his intentions, however, the sheer
length of his career (some 65 years) and the volume of his output make
it hard to speak of a coherent Wundtian
 doctrine.[3]
 His corpus is riven by tensions and ambiguities, and though
his work has undergone periodic scholarly reconsiderations,
Wundt’s lasting importance for the field of psychology remains
the topic of lively debate among
 psychologists.[4]


For philosophers, Wundt is worth studying for two reasons. First, the
arguments he made more than a century ago for the legitimacy of a
non-reductionist account of consciousness offer both challenges and
resources to contemporary psychology and philosophy of mind alike.
Should those arguments be found lacking, there remains a second,
perhaps more important reason to read him: not understanding Wundt is
to tolerate a lacuna at a crucial nexus of the recent history of
philosophy. Not only was he a powerful influence (albeit mostly by
repulsion) upon the founders of Pragmatism, Phenomenology, and
neo-Kantianism, it was also Wundt and his pioneering students who
developed the empirical methodologies that first granted psychology a
disciplinary identity distinct from philosophy. It is these
philosophically germane aspects of his thought that this article
describes.

John Wyclif,0.6758505702018738,0.2615924775600433,"

John Wyclif (ca. 1330–84) was one of the most important and
authoritative thinkers of the Middle Ages. His activity is set in the
very crucial period of late Scholasticism, when the new ideas and
doctrines there propounded accelerated the transition to the modern
way of thought. On the one hand, he led a movement of opposition to
the medieval Church and to some of its dogmas and institutions, and
was a forerunner of the Reformation; on the other, he was also the
most prominent English philosopher of the second half of the
14th century. His logical and ontological theories are, at
the same time, the final result of the preceding realistic tradition
of thought and the starting-point of the new forms of realism at the
end of the Middle Ages, since many authors active during the last
decades of the 14th and the first decades of the
15th centuries (Robert Alyngton, William Penbygull,
Johannes Sharpe, William Milverley, Roger Whelpdale, John Tarteys, and
Paul of Venice), were heavily influenced by his metaphysics and
largely used his logical apparatus. However, his philosophical system,
rigorous in its general design, contains unclear and aporetic points
that his followers attempted to remove. Although an influential
thinker, Wyclif pointed to the strategy the Realists at the
end of the Middle Ages were to adopt, rather than fully developed
it.

John Wyclif's Political Philosophy,0.6719896793365479,0.2684825360774994,"


The central idea of Wyclif's political philosophy is that the
dominium defining God's primary relation to creation
justifies all human dominium, whether it be the mastery of a
king, a lesser civil lord, or a priest. But unlike predecessors who
were content to define God's mastery as foundational to human lordship
in non-metaphysical terms, Wyclif made ready use of his realist
ontology to argue that God's dominium functions as a
universal by causality for all instances of just human
dominium. For medieval political theorists, this was not
common practice; some, like
 Aquinas,
 can be argued to present unified systems of metaphysics, political
thought, and ecclesiology, but many others, including
 Ockham,
 Marsilius of Padua, John of Paris, and
 Giles of Rome,
 did not. If, like Ockham or Giles, they had metaphysical positions,
it is impossible to argue persuasively that their ontologies affected
their politics. This makes Wyclif's political and ecclesiological
thought notable, for it is one of the few cases where a distinguished
metaphysician used his ontology as a foundation for a detailed
examination of the just arrangement of authority in church and
state. An immediate corrollary to Wyclif's axiomatic position that all
just human dominium derives from God is that no private
property relations, which serve as the underpinnings for all human
mastery, are just without grace. Because, following
 Augustine,
 private property is a direct result of the Fall of man, the ideal
state is one of communal ownership. Since the Church is the
re-established ideal state, grace does not provide for its just
ownership of any property whatsoever. Because Wyclif saw the
fourteenth-century church enjoying the lion's share of property
ownership in England, he argued that the king was bound by God to
relieve the church of its property, and to rule over it as a divinely
appointed steward. The substance of this argument was realized by
Henry VIII, and so Wyclif has been associated, if only as prophetic
forerunner, with Tudor reformation. The form of Wyclif's arguments are
in no way comparable to modern arguments, though, and are more
directly associated with earlier Franciscan positions, like those of
 Ockham,
 than they are with later political theory. In this essay, the Latin
term dominium will be used to distinguish Wyclif's
theologically medieval view from its modern English correlate
'dominion', which connotes absolute mastery.

became head of the Academy after Speusippus died, in 339/338
(“in the second year of the 110th Olympiad”). D.L. says he
held that position for twenty-five years, and died at 82. So his dates
work out to 396/395–314/313.

On the death of Plato, when Speusippus became head of the Academy,
Xenocrates and Aristotle may have left Athens together at the
invitation of Hermeias of Atarneus (see Strabo XIII 57, printed in
Gaiser 1988, 380–381, discussed at 384–385), and
Xenocrates returned to succeed Speusippus. According to D.L. (iv 3),
this was at Speusippus' request, while the Academicorum Index
Herculanensis (cols. VI-VII: Mekler 1902, 38–39, Gaiser
1988, 193) tells us that the younger members of the Academy voted on
the succession and confirmed Xenocrates by a narrow margin. These two
accounts, although not incompatible, do not tell the same story, and
it does not appear  possible to get behind them to what really
happened.

D.L.'s bibliography (iv 11–14) lists over 70 titles; nothing
whatever of these has survived, even in the form of identifiable
quotations in other authors. Reconstruction of Xenocrates' views
turns, as in the case of Speusippus, on Aristotle, and, again as in
the case of Speusippus, this is made the more difficult by Aristotle's
frequent failure actually to name Xenocrates when talking about his
views. In fact, Aristotle never mentions Xenocrates by name in
discussing his metaphysical views.

What is left of Xenocrates' views is here divided up under three
headings: Metaphysics, Theory of Knowledge, and Ethics. Sextus
Empiricus tells us (Adversus mathematicos vii 16; fr. 1H,
82IP: here and in the sequel ‘H’ refers to the collection
of fragments in Heinze 1892 and ‘IP’ to that in Isnardi
Parente 1982) that Xenocrates was explicit about the division of
philosophical topics implicit in Plato, into ‘physics’,
‘ethics’, and ‘logic’; this became the norm in
Stoicism and Hellenistic philosophy in general. We have a great deal
more to work with under the first heading than under the other two. As
is standard with this terminology, what we are accustomed to refer to
as metaphysics and theory of knowledge are included in
‘physics’ and ‘logic’, respectively.

Sextus' report about the standard division of philosophy coming
through Xenocrates but ultimately from Plato is typical of much of
what we hear about Xenocrates: he appears to have been at least as
concerned to carry on the thought of Plato as to promulgate ideas of
his own.

Xenophanes,0.6655312776565552,0.015763502568006516,"


Xenophanes of Colophon was a philosophically-minded poet who lived
in various parts of the ancient Greek world during the late
6th and early 5th centuries BCE He is best
remembered for a novel critique of anthropomorphism in religion, a
partial advance toward monotheism, and some pioneering reflections on
the conditions of knowledge. Many later writers, perhaps influenced by
two brief characterizations of Xenophanes by Plato (Sophist
242c–d) and Aristotle (Metaphysics 986b18-27), identified him
as the founder of Eleatic philosophy (the view that, despite
appearances, what there is is a changeless, motionless, and eternal
‘One’). In fact, the Xenophanes who emerges from the
surviving fragments defies simple classification. He was a travelling
rhapsode who criticised the stories about the gods told by the poets,
and he defended a novel conception of the divine nature. But he was
also a reflective observer of the human condition, a practitioner of
the special form of ‘inquiry’ (historiê)
introduced by the Milesian philosopher-scientists, and a civic
counselor who encouraged his fellow citizens to respect the gods and
work to safeguard the well-being of their city.

Count Paul Yorck von Wartenburg,0.6361938118934631,0.5349802374839783,"


Count Hans Ludwig Paul Yorck von Wartenburg (1835–1897) was a
German philosopher. He is primarily known for his long collaboration
with his friend Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911) and for his impact
on Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) and Hans-Georg Gadamer
(1900–2002). Together with Dilthey, Yorck was the first
philosopher to elaborate the specific concept of historicity
[Geschichtlichkeit] as a defining characteristic in
the ontology of human beings. In particular, Yorck
emphasized the generic difference between the ontic and the
historical, i.e., the difference between what is seen or
conceptualized (and aesthetically contemplated) as permanent nature,
or essence, or idea, and the felt historical rhythm of life, i.e.,
life's immersion in and belonging to the overarching and always
changing waves of history. In contradistinction to Dilthey's
epistemological endeavors to clarify the foundations of the historical
sciences vis-à-vis the natural sciences, Yorck aimed
exclusively at the ontology of historical life, particularly the
historical band (syndesmos) and effective connection
(virtuality) that unites generational life. Based on the
primacy of historical life, Yorck adopted a decidedly
anti-metaphysical stance, rejecting all claims of knowledge
sub specie aeternitatis. He combined this with a Christian,
particularly Lutheran, conception of a historical and personal but
entirely transcendent God, relative to whom each individual person, in
inescapable singularity, defines his or her own life story.  Yorck's
ideas were first made public in the form of a posthumous volume of
his Correspondence with Dilthey in 1923 (Yorck 1923). Through
this publication he influenced not only Heidegger (see Farin 2016 and
Ruin 1994) and Gadamer (1990), but also Misch, Rothacker, Scholem,
Bultmann, Marcuse, and others. Between 1956 and 1970 various
unfinished fragments of Yorck's writings were published
(see Bibliography). They contain the outline of
Yorck's systematic psychology of history and history of philosophy, as
well as extensive reflections on the partial negation or suppression
of temporality in thought and metaphysics (due to the inherently
spatial character of representation and thought as such). These later
works have not received as much attention as his earlier views in
his Correspondence with Dilthey.

Giacomo Zabarella,0.5975481271743774,0.21996137499809265,"


Giacomo (Jacopo) Zabarella (b. 1533 in Padua, d. 1589 in Padua) is
considered the prime representative of Renaissance Italian
Aristotelianism. Known most of all for his writings on logic and
methodology, Zabarella was an alumnus of the University of Padua,
where he received his Ph.D. in philosophy. Throughout his teaching
career at his native university, he also taught philosophy of nature
and science of the soul (De anima). Among his main works are
the collected logical works Opera logica (1578) and writings
on natural philosophy, De rebus naturalibus (1590). Zabarella
was an orthodox Aristotelian seeking to defend the scientific status
of theoretical natural philosophy against the pressures emanating from
the practical disciplines, i.e., the art of medicine and anatomy. He
developed the regressus method, which the Renaissance
Aristotelians regarded as the proper method for obtaining knowledge in
the theoretical sciences. At the turn of the seventeenth century
Zabarella’s writings were reprinted in Germany, where his
philosophy had a notable following, especially among Protestant
Aristotelian authors.

Zeno of Elea,0.7996093034744263,0.2450428456068039,"


Zeno of Elea, 5th c. B.C.E. thinker, is known exclusively for 
propounding a number of ingenious paradoxes. The most famous of these
purport to show that motion is impossible by bringing to light 
apparent or latent contradictions in ordinary assumptions regarding 
its occurrence. Zeno also argued against the commonsense assumption 
that there are many things by showing in various ways how it, too, 
leads to contradiction. We may never know just what led Zeno to 
develop his famous paradoxes. While it is typically said that he 
aimed to defend the paradoxical monism of his Eleatic mentor, 
Parmenides, the Platonic evidence on which this view has resided 
ultimately fails to support it. Since Zeno’s arguments in fact tend 
to problematize the application of quantitative conceptions to 
physical bodies and to spatial expanses as ordinarily conceived, the 
paradoxes may have originated in reflection upon Pythagorean efforts 
to apply mathematical notions to the natural world. Zeno’s paradoxes 
have had a lasting impact through the attempts, from Aristotle down 
to the present day, to respond to the problems they raise. Since the 
subject of this article is Zeno himself, it undertakes to provide an 
historically accurate overview of his own thought, rather than an 
account of how philosophers, mathematicians, and physicists have 
responded to his provocative arguments.

Zombies,0.7622554898262024,0.4448680579662323,"


Zombies in philosophy are imaginary creatures designed to illuminate
problems about consciousness and its relation to the physical
world. Unlike those in films or witchcraft, they are exactly like us
in all physical respects but without conscious experiences: by
definition there is ‘nothing it is like’ to be a
zombie. Yet zombies behave just like us, and some even spend a lot of
time discussing consciousness.


Few people, if any, think zombies actually exist. But many hold they
are at least conceivable, and some that they are possible. It seems
that if zombies really are possible, then physicalism is false and
some kind of dualism is true. For many philosophers that is the chief
importance of the zombie idea. But it is also valuable for the sharp
focus it gives to philosophical theorizing about consciousness (for
example Howell 2013; Kriegel 2011; Stoljar 2006; Tye 2008). Use of the
zombie idea against physicalism also raises more general questions
about the relations between imaginability, conceivability, and
possibility. Finally, zombies raise epistemological difficulties: they
reinstate the ‘other minds’ problem.
